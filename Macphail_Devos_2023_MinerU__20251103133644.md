Depositional evidence of settlement occupation during ca. 800-1500 AD in Europe.

# Introduction

Geoarchaeological investigation of urban deposits dating broadly to the Middle Ages has great potential for the reconstruction of settlement lifestyles and environments, and this is demonstrated by several post-Roman Dark Earth studies that have been carried out in European cities (Nicosia et al. 2012; Devos et al. 2020). Indeed, the seemingly unstratified deposit called Dark Earth has posed a major challenge to urban archaeologists because its macroscopic homogeneity makes discovering its internal complexity difficult to discern and interpret without geoarchaeological investigation (see, for instance, Nicosia et al. 2017 for examples of how Dark Earth has variously supplied information on different urban land uses). Often, recovered macrofossil (botanical and faunal) and microfossil (diatom, foraminifera, palynological, and phytolith) remains have been employed on their own to

reconstruct urban environments in the Middle Ages. An example was the use of plant and insect macrofossils, and parasite ova at Coppergate, York (now the Jorvik Viking Centre) to reconstruct Viking lifestyles and urban land use (Kenward and Hall 1995). Sometimes, these techniques of "environmental archaeology" have been carried out in parallel with geoarchaeological methods (Keevill 2004), and occasionally the two have been fully integrated (Macphail et al. 2007; Devos et al. 2017). We describe a number of geoarchaeological site examples that have contributed greatly to an improved understanding of European urban environments and use of space through time during the medieval period (Table 1).

Thematically, occupation deposits can be divided into those where evidence indicates construction, occupation surfaces including domestic and stabling floors (and other spaces linked to animal management), use of open areas for waste disposal and markets, cultivation and gardening, transport features such as roads and harbors, and occasional examples of funerary activities and constructed cesspits (Macphail et al. 2017). We focus upon three geographical locations: the UK, mainland Europe, and Scandinavia.

In the UK, urban archaeology and some aspects of geoarchaeology began as early as the 1900s in London (Norman and Reader 1912), with organizations, such as Rescue – The British Archaeological Trust, trying to mitigate widespread removal of urban deposits such as Dark Earth during the 1960s. Now, many other important city sites have been reported upon, such as from Canterbury, Winchester, and York (Biddle et al. 1973; Bowsher et al. 2007; Hicks 2015). In mainland Europe, there has been a strong increase in geoarchaeological studies over the last decades focusing upon urban deposits from medieval times. This research concentrates mostly on Belgium (Devos et al. 2020), France (Cammas et al. 2011), Italy (Nicosia 2018), Russia (Aleksandrovskii et al. 2015), and Switzerland (Rentzel and Pümpin 2017). Occasionally, geoarchaeological research has also been conducted on medieval town deposits in the Czech

Republic (Lisá et al. 2020), Germany (Pümpin et al. 2021), Poland (see for instance Mazurek et al. 2016), and Spain (Gutiérrez-Rodríguez et al. 2020). In the Baltic (Wiedner et al. 2015; Banerjea et al. 2017) and Scandinavia, urban deposits in some Swedish towns, Odense and Copenhagen in Denmark, and Oslo, Kaupang, and Trondheim in Norway, have come under scrutiny, again in the last decades, and as at York and Antwerp, some exceptional organic preservation has been encountered due to waterlogging (see Fig. 1a–1e) (Heimdahl 2005; Wouters 2020; Goldberg et al. 2022, 333–334).

# Study Methods

Soil micromorphology is often the standard control method applied to urban site profiles, sometimes with parallel bulk

sample analyses such as geochemical logging (see Fig. 3d) and also increasingly combined with selective phytolith and microchemical (e.g., SEM/EDS - energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry) analyses directly on thin sections (Goldberg et al. 2022, Chap. 17).

# Urban Activity Themes

# Constructional Activity

Urban contexts are typically characterized by impressive sequences of artificial (i.e., anthropogenic) sediments, resulting from large-scale transportation of materials (Borderie et al. 2020b). These deposits resulting from human transportation can either become quickly buried, or they can become subjected to intense pedogenetic processes, including bioturbation, thus creating so-called Dark Earth.

Constructional debris is an important component in numerous of these urban medieval deposits, such as backfill, levelling layers, middens, and Dark Earth. Whereas larger pieces of mortars, plasters, bricks, and limestones are often readily recognized during fieldwork, unheated earthen-based construction material is frequently overlooked, as it often requires microscopic identification. Their omnipresence within urban medieval deposits reflects the lasting importance of such construction materials (cf. Macphail 1994). For instance, exogenous dense (sub-)rounded fragments of brickearth

have been encountered in large quantities in the Dark Earth deposits of the site of Tour Anneessens (Brussels, Belgium), permitting geoarchaeologists to identify a thirteenth-century earthen-based building phase (Fig. 2) (Devos 2019). Domestic and stabling structures record a variety of floor makeup and usually strongly contrasting overlying occupation deposits (see below). For example, in London and Canterbury, clean brickearth was used to construct floors, while at coastal Yarmouth, Norfolk, estuarine clays were employed. At Winchester, floors and hearth makeup involved the use of

Frame

local clay-with-flints. Both wattle- and stave-walled buildings dating to AD 1050–1140 were encountered at the London Guildhall site, and at this farming settlement, raw dung was used to line wattle walls (see Fig. 1e) and as a filler for levelling brickearth floors and for stabilizing posts (Bowsher et al. 2007).

One multi-proxy study was carried out on the medieval Baltic city of Riga, Latvia, while geochemistry alone was used to characterize a variety of Norse settlements producing Dark Earth sites across northwestern Europe (Wiedner et al. 2015; Banerjea et al. 2017). At the latter, not only were organic chemistry investigations carried out, but also studies of black carbon, a common focus of interest across Scandinavia (Sorensen et al. 2007).

Microscopic brick fragments are also regularly reported, but it is not always possible to distinguish these from ceramic fragments (see for instance Maritan 2017). Mortar and plaster are other typical components of many urban deposits, witnessing the importance of construction activities (see Fig. 3). They have been recorded in many Dark Earth deposits on the continent. Mostly, they are correlated with the destruction of older buildings. Nevertheless, on the sites of Casa delle Bestie Ferite (Aquileia, Italy) (Nicosia 2018, 77) and Rue des Pierres (Brussels, Belgium) (Devos et al. 2017), the plaster remains were attributed to in situ, poor quality, plaster floors. Occasionally, limestones are observed. This is, for instance, the case on the central market square in Lier (Belgium) where

they likely correspond to debris from prestigious buildings (Wouters et al. 2017). Wood and especially charred wood are ubiquitous in medieval urban deposits, but they can rarely be directly attributed to construction and destruction activities (see Fig. 1a).

Postdepositional weathering of constructional layers in northern latitude leaching environments can make these difficult to identify absolutely. At two Danish city locations, compact sand layers occur within sequences of occupation deposits, but although clean sands were often employed to ground-raise and seal/cleanse probably unpleasant phosphate-stained materials (see below), some sandy contexts have a more complex origin. For example, at AD 1150-1250 Råduspladsen Nord (City Hall Square), Copenhagen (Terje Stafseth, unpublished report; described in Dahlström 2022), and later medieval Vilhelm Werners Plads, Odense, Funen, careful scrutiny found small areas of relict calcitic matrix material cementing the sands. Such remains record construction of lime plaster floors, findings which clearly raise the status of such floors/surfaces and associated internal space (Fig. 3a, b, and d). The remains of Viking Age lime-plastered floors were also found at Volden, Aarhus, while the presence of a late medieval mortared floor in Norwich, UK, was consistent with the presence of a high-status merchant's house called the Dragon Hall (Shelley 2005). As previously noted, the preservation of organic building materials is aided by waterlogging (see Fig. 1a and e, and

Layer 8 is a high-status lime plaster floor employing well-sorted fine sand – which includes limestone sands; the overlying Layer 7, again with embedded gravel, is a diffusely layered lime floor (or floors), of slightly lower quality – containing inclusions such as bone (Bo). Frame width is  $\sim 50\mathrm{mm}$ . (d) As in (a), a schematic log of selected chemical and magnetic susceptibility data through the Layer 5–12 sequence. Layers 9 and 10 are particularly rich in phosphate (1500 ppm P), zinc (0.010–0.012% Zn), and sulfur (0.055–0.100% S), and they have an enhanced magnetic susceptibility, reflecting middening, see (b). Layer 8 is clearly iron-poor (0.971% Fe) due to the use of clean sands, but it has higher amounts of Ca (3.23%) related to the mortar floor construction, see (c).

below for shipwrecks), but at the four-church sequence begun in the early-to-mid eleventh century at 7-11, Søndre gate, Trondheim, Norway, charring of floor timbers in these fire-razed wooden churches recorded each construction (Macphail et al. Forthcoming). Here, the now-open sites with only wooden floor remains and traces of each razed church were utilized for opportunistic waste disposal of fish processing debris; clean sands were then commonly employed to seal these refuse deposits ahead of the next church construction. Chemical analysis of these discard residues (EDS directly on the thin sections) recorded fish remains and stained matrix soil with  $30.9\%$  and  $4.37\%$ $\mathrm{P}_2\mathrm{O}_5$ , respectively. The preservation of the charred floors was also aided by phosphatic drainage from these waste deposits.

One useful characteristic of some urban sites in Europe is the greater possibility of wood and other organic matter preservation, including floors and floor coverings. Constructional remains encountered both in medieval Oslo and Trondheim also include wooden board walks (Fig. 1a) and both in situ and dumped, partially humified, monocotyledonous plant remains – from the covering of floors with rushes, for example (Macphail and Goldberg 2018, 377). Intercalated fish bones have also been found in these floor coverings, which were renewed but probably not often removed; the latter occur as compact humified remains that cannot often be identified by macrofossil analysis. Waterlogged preservation of organic urban remains was also reported in Sweden (Heimdahl 2005), and in Oslo harbor, where medieval shipwrecks and wood working debris occur (Fig. 1b–d) (Macphail and Goldberg 2018, 15–20; Linderholm et al. 2021).

The minerogenic constructional debris below the East Cloister Walk at Exeter Cathedral dating to ca. AD 1140 onwards is rich in limestone and basalt-tempered mortar fragments. There is a coincidental geochemical peak in Ca, and a concentration of Pb which is assumed to record artisan use of lead – for example, glazing, soldering (Macphail et al. 2022). At the Tower of London, however, high amounts of Pb in moat sediments at the base of the original Henry II barbican more likely result from use of molten lead to “cement” foundations in conditions too wet for mortaring (Keevill 2004), while anomalous Pb enrichment in general may be ascribable to drainage from lead roofs. Inputs from garderobes could account for phosphate concentrations (max 2800 ppm P) (Macphail and Crowther 2004).

# Occupation Floor Deposits

Besides the construction debris, remains of in situ floor layers are regularly excavated. Stabling floor deposits and byre waste dumps are characterized by dung and partially humified plant-rich animal bedding remains, which are pollen-rich and dominated by cereals and grasses (e.g., of fodder origin), and high levels of organic matter statistically linked to phosphate (Macphail et al. 2007). Zn (zinc) is also statistically correlated

to amounts of organic matter. Domestic floor deposits are much more minerogenic and heterogeneous, which is reflected in a more sparse but wider pollen spectra compared to byre deposits, and burnt mineral inclusions produce a higher magnetic susceptibility; heavy metals Cu and Pb are also more concentrated.

Occupation deposits can provide important information on the use of space within a building. In Gien (France), husks resulting from cereal processing were used as a floor cover in a tenth century AD domestic space (Borderie et al. 2020a). In the Burchtsite (Antwerp, Belgium), the combination of micromorphological and insect data of a sequence of floors dating from the eighth to tenth century AD recorded an alternation of domestic use, including the use of ashes for cleaning purposes, and stabling activities (Crabtree et al. 2017). Floor maintenance, including sweeping, has been observed in thirteenth to fourteenth century AD floors along the Veselá Street in the historical center of Brno (Czech Republic) (Lisa et al. 2020). On the site of Corso Porta Reno (Ferrara, Italy), micromorphology demonstrated that a series of what were initially thought to be prepared silt floor levels corresponded more likely to fluvial deposits, alternated with trampled material originating from the cleaning of hearths (Nicosia 2018, 40-46). Kitchen, food preparation residues, and associated hearth debris can be recorded as trampled ash, charcoal, burnt mineral material, and sometimes burnt eggshell and fish bones in occupation surface accumulations, as found at Viking Volden, Aarhus, and Stavanger (predating Stavanger Cathedral; Fig. 4) and at a medieval (twelfth to thirteenth centuries) cook shop at the London Guildhall site (Macphail et al. 2007).

# Open Areas, Urban Waste Disposal, and Market Places

Waste disposal and medieval soil pollution is becoming an important research topic. It has been studied in quite some detail for a series of sites in Belgium, Poland, and Russia. Occasionally, this theme has also been dealt with in France (Borderie et al. 2020a). For late medieval Brussels, for instance, different patterns of waste disposal have been recognized: on many sites, dumps of construction rubble – composed of a mixture of plaster, mortar, brick, and sediments – served to level surfaces. Cess and stabling waste were used to enhance the fertility of gardens and fields. Artisan waste was often disposed in the immediate vicinity of the artisanal workshops. This was the case with different types of butchery waste as observed, for instance, on the site of Rue d’Une Personne (see also above, Søndre gate, Trondheim, for fish waste disposal). These trends were also replicated in a fourteenth century dump in the precincts of Winchester Cathedral (see “ $\triangleright$  Microstratigraphy” entry, Figs. 7 and 8). Another example is the site of Via Pigna (Verona, Italy) where important concentrations of metal slag, droplets, and spherical hammer scales were attributed to the vicinity of a

metallurgical workshop (Bortolini et al. 2022). Open areas were often used for waste disposal that included human fecal matter, although many urban areas did include constructed cesspits (see the “ $\triangleright$  Privies and Latrines” entry).

The importance of open spaces within medieval towns has been acknowledged by several authors (Macphail et al. 2007). Over the last decades, geoarchaeology, and especially soil micromorphology, has significantly contributed to the understanding of the organization of open spaces in medieval urban contexts. The systematic study of Dark Earth deposits in the center of Brussels (Belgium) permitted the organization of

Layer 5053 mainly records a middening phase in this "disused" space, with deposition of probable liquid cess (Ce) and other remains, such as charcoal (Ch) and coprolitic bone (CB). The midden layer was sealed by dumped clay (DC), the forerunner of the clay floor above. Frame height is  $\sim 80\mathrm{mm}$ . (d) As in (a), photomicrograph of M5045, deposits below Stavanger Cathedral (Profile C5042; Layer 5054); burnt mollusk shell and iron-stained fish bone remains.

Waste disposal from the earliest days of Copenhagen, AD 950 to  $\sim 1200$  was rather intense, and indicated a high population density. Middening may have succeeded a local agricultural land use at the City Square site (see Fig. 3a-d) (as at Brussels, see above), and such cultivation activities also included possible horticultural land use within Copenhagen's first moated area (unpublished report by Andrea Borgius and Terje Stafseth, described in Dahlström 2022). Middening deposits were commonly ash-based (ash, charcoal, and

burnt mineral material) and additionally involved possible craft (suggested burnt and unburnt antler, vesicular silica slag), and food and latrine (bone, fish bone, probably coprolitic bone, likely dog coprolite fragments, marked iron-phosphate staining) waste. Such occupation residues, which include evidence for fish consumption, were found mixed with subsoil in an AD 950-1050 grave backfill at the City Square location (Fig. 3a-d). This is consistent with anthropogenic signatures that peak at  $1500~\mathrm{ppm}$  phosphate, an enhanced magnetic susceptibility of  $132(\chi \mathrm{lf}10^{-8}\mathrm{m}^3\mathrm{kg}^{-1})$  and a maximum of  $0.012\%$  Zn. The moat fill is also noteworthy, as it records water probably polluted with latrine waste and ashy soot. Some varve-like sedimentation may also testify to seasonal freezing of the moat.

Another use of open areas is for market places, and these are another point of focus in recent geoarchaeological studies. In Lier (Belgium), for example, the fourteenth-century market area corresponded to a multifunctional, intensively used, muddy area that became occasionally flooded (Wouters et al. 2017). Open ground in front of Magdeburg Cathedral (Germany) recorded an accumulation of limestone-based minerogenic deposits, possibly associated with constructional activities (see Exeter Cathedral, above), as well as large amounts of ash and phytolith-rich deposits of discard origin. Of specific note are fragments of lead-rich bronze droplets, which corroded into the deposits as mapped by microprobe, and which are assumed to be linked to twelfth-century bronze bell founding (Macphail et al. 2007). In the Main Market Square site in Krakow (Poland), enhanced Cu concentrations were attributed to construction activities and metallurgical activities. In turn, increasing levels of Pb over time were attributed to metallurgical activities, the manufacture of gunpowder, and printing (Kowalska et al. 2016) (see the Tower of London, above).

# Cultivation and Gardening

Besides the localization of different activity areas in open spaces, a better understanding of different practices can also be obtained. The integrated study of micromorphology and phytoliths, for instance, identified the cultivation of several cereal crop types on medieval fields in towns in Flanders, Brussels, and Wallonia and documented liming and manuring practices (Devos et al. 2020, and references therein). Gardens, small-scale plots that were intensively cultivated have been identified in a series of towns. As such, a late medieval-early modern age garden was discovered at the Brothers Hospitaliers of St. John of God monastery in Wroclaw (Poland) showing evidence of double and triple digging (Krupski et al. 2017). This traditional practice, evidenced by alternating soil-infilled grooves in the ground, can also be traced to Roman London, for example, and involves the digging of

trenches into which manure is thrown; the trench is then inflated with soil dug from the next trench (Couts et al. 1930, 50; Macphail and Goldberg 2018, 332–333). A series of late medieval kitchen gardens was also discovered in the historical center of Brussels. Although the phosphorus data do not significantly differ between crop fields and gardens, both showing elevated  $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{total}}$  levels and a low  $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{total}} / \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{inorg}}$  ratio, gardens present a much more diverse and rich content of phosphorus-containing materials (Devos 2018). In several cases, thick layers of construction debris served as a foundation for the creation of garden soils. This was, for instance, the case on the sites of the Court of Hoogstraeten and Place de la Vieille-Halle-aux-Blés (Brussels, Belgium). Similarly, the biologically worked urban garden soils often result from intensive manuring, and this involved, for example, Augustinian monastic waste disposal at Whitefriars, Canterbury; a phosphate-rich and relatively humic soil was produced (Hicks 2015).

Garden soils could also have a secondary use at other ecclesiastical locations, with the "bishop's garden" at Exeter Cathedral possibly being used for inhumations ahead of the building of the overlying Chapter House (AD 1227) and formal inhumations. The earlier garden soils, which seem to be affected by body stains, have the highest concentrations of organic matter and phosphate; in addition, PCA modelling grouped Ba, Fe, Mn, Cu, Ni, Sn, and Ni (cf. Usai et al. 2014; Cannell et al. 2018).

# Transport Features: Urban Roads and Harbors

While rural road and roadside wash deposits have evidence of muddy trample and sparse inputs from stock movements, for example, town road fills can accumulate rapidly and record very localized activities and discard. The geochemistry and parallel soil micromorphology study of two Late Saxon (850-1060 AD) within-city lane fills within Canterbury (Hicks and Houlistan 2018) showed high concentrations of carbonate, phosphate, Pb, and a very strongly enhanced magnetic susceptibility, which are probably linked to the disposal of calcitic ash and oyster shell, bone, and latrine waste, metal working debris (iron slag), respectively, with microprobe mapping showing that Pb impregnated shelly material for example.

Many cities were and are ports, and ancient harbors now often occur within reclaimed land. In Oslo harbor, medieval and early sixteenth-century shipwrecks have been investigated alongside the sediments in which they lie (see Fig. 1b-d), with typical fjord slumping taking some shallow water/subaerial near-harbor sediments dating to the 1300-1400 AD, into anomalously deep water (Macphail and Goldberg 2018, 15-20; Linderholm et al. 2021).

# Summary

Although medieval urban deposits were probably first officially recorded in London, UK, such evidence of occupation has been investigated increasingly across the whole of Europe over the last few decades. The current trend is now to see how deposits vary both laterally and vertically, so that activities can be monitored through both time and space. In this way, constructional activities, constructional materials, use of space within buildings and in open areas, cultivation land use, and connectivity within cities, have all come under scrutiny. Some new urban topics have been revealed such as the characterization of market places, soil pollution from artisan activity, the possibility of encountering inhumation residues, and waterlogged deposits recording wooden structures and shipwreck remains.
