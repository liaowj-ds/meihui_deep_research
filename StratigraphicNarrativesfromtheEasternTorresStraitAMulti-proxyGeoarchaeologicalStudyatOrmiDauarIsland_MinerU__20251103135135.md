# ABSTRACT

In the Eastern Torres Strait, a multi-proxy approach combining micro- and macro-scale geoarchaeological techniques has been applied at Ormi (Dauar Island), an archaeological midden site dating from 2600–2250 cal. BP. This study combines soil micromorphology with particle size analysis and geochemical analyses (Carbon/Nitrogen ratios; Total Phosphorus (Pt) and Portable X-ray Fluorescence (pXRF)) to assess integrity of the deposits. The geoarchaeological analyses provide new insights into site formation processes, while microscopic analyses on paleosols allow settlement chronologies (including those associated with pottery) to be refined.

# Introduction

Torres Strait (TS) is a critical boundary zone between culturally and linguistically diverse communities which served as a land bridge between mainland Australia and New Guinea 10,000 years ago (Figure 1; McNiven 2024). However, little is known about how Torres Strait societies adapted to the marine transgression, flooding of the land bridge and formation of their new island environments. Indeed, there is currently no archaeological evidence of human occupation on the Torres land bridge during the Late Pleistocene and early Holocene (McNiven 2024). Although the earliest human occupation of islands in the TS is pre-ceramic, pottery provides a marker of cultural interaction with communities from New Guinea (McNiven 2021; Ulm et al. 2024).

Islands in the Eastern Torres Strait (ETS), including Mer, Dauar, and Waier, preserve evidence for post-Lapita human expansion from New Guinea in the form of pottery (some with red-slip) in 2600-1200 year-old deposits on Dauar Island (Carter 2001; Nutman et al. 2024). Two islands in Western Torres Strait (WTS), Pulu and Mabuiag (Mabuyag), contain locally made pottery, suggesting a pottery industry indigenous to this region and dating to roughly 2600-1200 cal. BP (McNiven et al. 2006; Wright and Dickinson

2009; Wright, Repu, and Passi 2021). However, the paucity of data (currently less than 50 confirmed sherds known for the entire TS), and difficulties in developing secure chronologies for pottery sherds rarely associated with clear cultural horizons, have hindered our understanding of the antiquity and cultural associations of pottery traditions in TS (Carter 2003; McNiven et al. 2006; Nutman et al. 2024; Wright and Dickinson 2009; Wright, Repu, and Passi 2021). Additionally, taphonomic processes, including bioturbation (e.g. turtle burrowing) are poorly understood for this region. Until detailed geoarchaeological research is conducted, the stratigraphic integrity of many isolated pottery sherds, frequently used as a key marker of migration from, or interaction with, communities on New Guinea, will remain uncertain (e.g. Carter 2004; Wright and Dickinson 2009). The primary aims of this paper are to: reconstruct site formation processes and assess stratigraphic integrity at Ormi, a cultural site on Dauar; characterise the chronology of human occupation of the site; and, thereby, improve our understanding of the provenance of any associated pottery sherds.

Archaeological investigations in the broader Asia-Pacific region indicate that interpretations of settlement chronologies are constrained by several

Geographical setting of the Murray Islands (A) and position of the sites in the geological map of the area, (adapted from State of Queensland, The Department of Natural Resources, scale 1: 100,000: 2018). The map shows the islands of Dauar and Waier and highlights other archaeological sites mentioned for comparison in the text (red dots). Geological key: Qhms are sand, muddy sand and sandy mud; shoreface, fringing reef and intertidal zone; TQpm are basalt lava and tuff. The figure also highlights in red the locations where ceramics have been found – Dauar Island (Ormi and Sokoli), Waier Island (Ne), and Mer Island (Zomar) (see Carter 2004).

taphonomic issues and the characteristics of the sedimentary matrix, which often hinder the interpretation of archaeological deposits (Denham 2003; Langley, Clarkson, and Ulm 2011; Morley 2017; Morley and Goldberg 2017; Rankmore 2011; Ward and Larcombe 2021). The application of multi-proxy geoarchaeological approaches has become increasingly common in the Indo-Pacific and Australia over the past two decades, providing high-resolution data regarding site formation processes and associated cultural activities (Anderson et al. 2024; Denham 2003; Denham and Grono 2017; Grono 2020; Prossor et al. 2022; Vannieuwenhuyse, O'Connor, and Balme 2017; Ward et al. 2017). For instance, in sediments prone to

admixing or without a clear stratigraphic layer or 'cultural horizon', such as coastal dunes, it can be challenging to differentiate primary formation (sedimentary and cultural depositional processes) from post-depositional processes (Leigh 2001). It is often uncertain whether the distribution of buried artefacts in sandy deposits is due to primary deposition or subsequent bioturbation, making it challenging to assess the integrity of deposits at an archaeological site. At some sites, particle size analysis (PSA) has been used to try to define cultural layers (e.g. David et al. 2007; Leigh 2001; McNiven, Brady, and Barham 2009). However, the utility of PSA in such contexts is uncertain as the technique uses bulk (potentially mixed) sediments

and provides no qualitative data on soil formation processes occurring within the sampled deposits. In situ analyses, such as soil micromorphology, provide greater qualitative resolution for the interpretation of site formation processes at archaeological sites (Leigh 2001; Macphail and McAvoy 2008).

# Geological and Geomorphological Context

The islands of Mer, Dauar, and Waier, collectively known as the Murray Islands, are remnants of wellpreserved Pleistocene volcanic cones. Known collectively as the Maer Volcanics, these islands consist of extrusive mafic volcanics, dominated by bedded tuff and basalt (Nutman et al. 2024; Willmott et al. 1969; Willmott et al. 1973). Similar volcanic formations are scattered across the ETS and on Daru Island near New Guinea (Nutman et al. 2024; Willmott et al. 1969; Willmott et al. 1973).

Dauar, the second largest Murray Island, measures  $1.6\mathrm{km}$  in length and  $800\mathrm{m}$  in width. It features two volcanic ash cones: Au Dauar, which rises to  $185\mathrm{m}$ , and Kebi Dauar, standing at  $76\mathrm{m}$ . The coastline is characterised by eroding cliffs, intertidal rock platforms and embayments. The latter (at Sokoli and Ormi) preserve evidence for considerable marine erosion, exposing low  $(1 - 4\mathrm{m}$  high) eroding sections (Carter 2004).

The island's eastern and western ends are marked by sand spits, while the interior has variable soil cover, with grasslands on the upper slopes and denser woodlands in lower areas. On the south coast of Dauar, the sea breached the crater rim at Ormi, forming a lower area between the main peaks of Au Dauer Giar and Kebi Dauer that features a long stretch of beach and access to the sea (Figure 1).

# Previous Archaeological Research on Dauar and Adjacent Waier Island

Preliminary research on Dauar was conducted between 1998 and 2002 as part of an international archaeological programme, 'The Murray Islands Archaeological Project (MIAP)'. This project, initiated by the Mer Island Community Council, involved collaboration between the traditional Meriam landowners, anthropologists from the University of Arkansas, USA, and archaeologists from James Cook University, Australia. The MIAP sought to document the chronology of marine resource use on the islands of Mer and Dauar (Bird et al. 2002; Carter 2002, 2003). Results suggested the earliest human occupation phase occurred approximately 2600-2250 cal. BP at the archaeological sites of Ormi and Sokoli located on the south and the north coasts of Dauar, respectively (Carter 2001; Carter 2004). Excavations comprised a  $2 \times 1\mathrm{m}$  test pit in an elevated position

behind the Sokoli embayment and a  $2 \times 1$  m trench located  $10\mathrm{m}$  inland from the foreshore and adjacent to a nineteenth and twentieth-century house built by the Dauareb community at Ormi (Carter 2004, Figure 2, 3).

The two sites exhibit similar cultural and stratigraphic sequences made of five horizons (Table 1). Both sites have surface layers of topsoil: Horizons I-II, 1900-1600 cal. BP at Ormi; and, Horizon I, 1400-900 cal. BP at Sokoli (Carter 2004, 180, 315). Excavations at Ormi revealed a shell midden in Horizon III (2000-1900 cal. BP), composed of reef species also found at Sokoli. At Sokoli, a shell midden was identified in Horizon II at a depth of  $50 - 70\mathrm{cm}$  dating to 1650-1400 cal. BP. Carter noticed an abrupt change in the sedimentary composition below each shell midden, which comprised a clay-rich deposit at both sites: Horizon IV, 2250-2000 cal. BP at Ormi and between Horizons III (1650-1400 cal. BP) and IV (1800-1650 cal. BP) at Sokoli (Carter 2004). These horizons were interpreted as evidence of vegetation clearance activities at Ormi and gardening practices at Sokoli. Preliminary starch and phytolith analyses indicate the potential presence of yam (Dioscorea sp.) and Musa at Sokoli at this time while ethnographic accounts reported recent gardening use (Carter and Lilley 2008, 74-75). The presence of these edible plant species, alongside human-deposited shell and bone remains, suggested a combined subsistence system of island horticulture and marine subsistence on Dauar (Parr and Carter 2003). Basal beach deposits at Ormi (Horizon V) dated to 2600-2250 cal. BP (Carter 2004) and at Sokoli (Horizon V) to 2600-1800 cal. BP (Carter 2004).

Pottery sherds were found in Horizons I, III, IV and V at Ormi (two sherds from Horizon I, one from Horizon III, 19 in Horizon IV and one from Horizon V); most sherds were deposited within layers dating to 2600-2000 cal. BP. At Sokoli, only one pottery sherd was found in Horizon I (c. 900-700 cal. BP). Carter stated that it was unlikely that all sherds found at Ormi (in layers IV and V) were in situ as, 'it is possible that these artefacts have moved down through the loosely consolidated sandy matrix of the lower two Horizons' (Carter 2004, 178).

Carter's research represents a significant contribution to the history of TS islanders. However, two questions remain unanswered. Firstly, do the Ormi and Sokoli excavations identify a reduction in cultural activity or shift of resource exploitation after 1400 years ago, namely, when the middens were abandoned? Secondly, what is the antiquity and duration of pottery use on Dauar?

In 2019, research was conducted on Dauar and Waier as part of the Waiet Archaeology Project to document settlement and ceremonial activities associated with ethnographically significant sites.

Figure 2. Site plan and geographical contextualisation of the site of Ormi. Synthetic profile from the beachfront to Ormi 3 (Transpect A-B). The transect indicates that the site of the old Ormi excavation from the 1980s was located  $2.5\mathrm{m}$  from the beach and approximately  $10\mathrm{m}$  from the new Ormi3 excavation. Ormi 2 was positioned  $32\mathrm{m}$  northeast of Ormi 3. The plan is a combination of the previous site plan by Carter (2004) and updated site plan drawn by D. Wright in 2022.

Archaeological research traced the pathways of important 'Culture Heroes', involving excavations at Ormi (detailed below), Teg on Dauar, and also a zogo (sacred) place at Ne on Waier (Wright and Van der Kolk 2019).

At Teg, sparse cultural deposits were observed. This included burnt bone, charcoal and shellfish dating to 539-498 cal. BP (S-ANU 50818, Charcoal fragment,  $^{14}\mathrm{C}519\pm 26$ ), followed by European materials in upper layers associated with a culturally remembered period of island use by the Dauareb people (Wright and Van der Kolk 2019). The latter spanned  $47~\mathrm{cm}$  of deposits, suggesting disturbance and/or rapid sedimentation during the last few hundred years (Wright and Van der Kolk 2019).

Wright and Van der Kolk (2019, 129) posited longstanding use of Ne for funerary practices, with earlier activities influencing a later association of this site with Waiet funerary ceremonies. Excavations at Ne revealed a surface scatter of occasionally ochred shellfish and human remains (Wright and Van der Kolk 2019). Shellfish, including samples taken directly from features associated with Waiet, were less than 300 years old suggesting a recent age for these mortuary and initiation rituals. A considerable amount of human bone was excavated below this, in a layer dating to approximately 1275-1123 cal. BP (S-ANU 52132, Strombus fragment) and overlaying deposits that included little cultural material with the notable exception of a single ceramic sherd.

Excavations on Dauar and Waier, conducted by the MIAP and Waiet Archaeology Projects, took place in coastal locations. Recent cultural and chronological discontinuities during the recent period (e.g. Horizons I-II at Ormi and Sokoli and Horizon II at Ne) may be explained in terms of layer removal through erosion or hiatus/ shift in cultural activity. Uncertainties relating

to (i) the nature of the deposits and (ii) artefact displacement, make it difficult to determine the cultural significance of upper layers (Carter 2004, 178, 269). These uncertainties about the chronological and cultural sequences required new research methodologies. A combination of macro- and micro-scale geoarchaeological techniques is designed to aid the assessment

# Recent Excavations and Archaeological Sequence at Ormi

In 2022, the site of Ormi 3 was re-excavated as part of the Waiet Archaeology Project (see Nutman et al.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/5f12a2ae-ee7b-4971-a8f0-2bb3dea744b3/54300954532cd27a1be1f2ae05e70f235b1439b96220ca2a581a68398729a9b5.jpg)  
Figure 4. Stratigraphic section for Ormi 3, with monolith sample locations indicated (Monoliths A, B and C) (Nutman et al. 2024).

2024; Wright et al. In prep.). Two new test pits (Ormi 2 and 3) were excavated behind a low eroded cliff marking the edge of the land; Ormi 3 was located further inland than the excavation of the MIAP project and the modern beach (Figure 2,3; see Nutman et al. 2024; Wright et al. In prep.). The test pit at Ormi 3 consisted of a  $100 \times 50$  cm unit, which cut into an eroding beach terrace in the centre of the Ormi embayment that contained a dense shell midden layer. A second  $100 \times 100$  cm test pit, Ormi 2, was situated  $32\mathrm{m}$  northeast of Ormi 3 and was chosen to assess site boundaries and provide comparative stratigraphy. Ormi 2 was defined by three stratigraphic layers (1-3). Layer 1 consisted of silty loam with roots and fibres, while layers 2 and 3 had a higher clay content and included shellfish remains (see Supplementary Online Material). Ormi 3 comprised of 30 arbitrary units (XUs) and reached an overall depth of  $305~\mathrm{cm}$  (see Nutman et al. 2024 and Wright et al. In prep. for further details).

Six major stratigraphic units (SU; terminology used during new excavations) were identified at Ormi 3 (SUs 1-6; see Figure 4; Table 2). During excavation, the stratigraphic units were identified based on soil texture, colour and consistency, as well as consideration of cultural materials. SU 1  $(0 - 28\mathrm{cm})$  was a darkbrown (7.5YR 3/3) silty loam comprising rounded, coarse-to-medium, calcareous sand with frequent pieces of eroded tuff. The topsoil (SU1) contained abundant roots and fibres with charcoal and fragments of broken shell and coral. SU 2  $(28 - 57~\mathrm{cm})$  was a grey (10YR 5/1) coarse-to-medium, calcareous sand, containing few volcanic particles and small pieces of fish bone, broken marine shells, charcoal, rock fragments and land snail fragments. SU 2 contained fewer roots than SU 1. SU 3  $(57 - 90~\mathrm{cm})$  comprised of a brown (10YR 4/3) medium-grained loose carbonate sand and a shell midden including Tridacna spp., Lambis lambis, Hippopus hippopus and Trochus spp. SU 4  $(90 - 105\mathrm{cm})$  was a very dark grey (10YR 3/1) loamy sand, comprising coarse-to-medium calcareous sand grains with fragments of

Note: Three unidentified charcoal fragments were dated with AMS at the ANU and two Acropora coral samples were analysed with MC-ICP-MS at the Radiogenic Isotope Facility in the University of Queensland. Charcoal samples were cleaned using a standard acid-base-acid protocol to remove exogenous carbonates, humic acids and degraded charcoal. Radiocarbon determinations were obtained using a NEC Single Stage AMS (Fallon, Fifield, and Chappell 2010). Radiocarbon ages were calibrated using the Oxcal Program (Bronk Ramsey 2009) and Intcal20 calibration curve (Reimer et al. 2020). The Acropora samples were examined using protocols described in detail in Zhou et al. (2011) and Clark et al. (2014).

Small fragments of charcoal, fish bone and shell (including Tridacna spp. Lambis lambis, Hippopus hippopus and Trochus spp.) were randomly dispersed throughout. The basal layer, SU 6 (200–310 cm) is a dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) very coarse-to-coarse sand incorporating sparse fragments of charcoal, fish bone and non-cultural shellfish.

Ormi 3 midden layer, SU 3, and underlying dark sediments, SU 4, closely compare with Horizon III and IV in Carter's research (2004; see Table 1; Figure

4). A single pottery sherd was found in SU 6, XU 23 (corresponding to Carter's Horizon V; Nutman et al. 2024). The chronology within the Ormi 3 excavation corresponds with previous research at this site (see Table 1; Table 2 for details).

# Methods

# Field Sampling Strategies

A range of geoarchaeological analyses were undertaken on monolith and bulk sediment samples from Ormi 3 and Ormi 2 (Figure 4). Three sediment blocks (monoliths) at Ormi 3 targeted the boundaries of SUs 1-2, 4-5 and 5-6 (Figure 5). Due to the difficulties related to the presence of the shell midden and roots, it was not possible to sample the boundary between SUs 2-3, SUs 3-4 and the shell midden. After shaping, the blocks were supported using gypsum bandages to retain the stratigraphy as much as possible. Bulk sediment samples for physical and geochemical analysis were collected from each of the six stratigraphic layers adjacent to each monolith at Ormi 3 and Ormi 2.

# Analytical Methods

Soil samples were shipped under the 2022-83257 permit (issued by the Australian Government's Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry's Northern Australia Quarantine Strategy - Torres Strait Inspection Service) and irradiated at  $50\mathrm{kGy}$  following the procedure by Steritech Pty Ltd. Prior to the particle size, geochemical and micromorphological analyses, all sediment samples from Ormi, both disturbed and undisturbed, were oven dried at  $40^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  for three days to remove moisture.

Bulk samples were used for four complementary types of geoarchaeological techniques: particle size analysis (PSA) providing proportional data on the fine earth fraction (sand, silt, or clay); C/N ratios measuring the proportions of carbon (C) to nitrogen (N) expressed in a ratio; total organic carbon (TOC) defining the amount of organic carbon within a sample; and total phosphorous (Pt) and available

phosphorous (Pa) content to assess relative intensity of human occupation (Goldberg and Macphail 2006).

All bulk samples for PSA analyses were pre-treated using hydrogen peroxide  $(\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2)$  digestion over three days to remove organic residues (Scott-Jackson and Walkington 2005). PSA analyses used a laser diffractometer Mastersizer 2000 (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK) with a Hydro G dispersion unit. Pump speed was set at  $2600~\mathrm{rpm}$  and obscuration values were between  $10\%$  and  $20\%$  (Mastersizer 2000). Four sets of measurements were obtained for each sample, from which an average was used for interpretation. Similarity indices (S.I.) were calculated using Comparative Particle Size Distribution matrices, as outlined by Langohr, Scoppa, and Van Wambeke (1976) and Devos et al. (2017), to assess parent material uniformity and identify lithological discontinuities.

Geochemical analyses followed standard protocols for Pt (Latimer and Buss 2022), Pa (Colwell method; Higgins and Latimer 2022) and C/N (Latimer 2022). Data for total carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN) content in the soil was determined (Latimer 2022). TOC was also calculated and analysed by the Skalar SNAccess software. Additionally, the pH levels of each stratigraphic unit, as identified and documented in the field, were measured on-site using a colorimetric field test to determine soil acidity and alkalinity.

The oriented blocks of sediments for micromorphological analyses (Monoliths A-C) were impregnated with epoxy resin and redried following the standard procedures set by the Adelaide Petrographic Laboratory. Three  $30\mu \mathrm{m}$  thick,  $5\times 7.5\mathrm{cm}$  thin sections were prepared from the Monoliths A-C. All thin sections were scanned with Epson Perfection V7000 Photo at 1200 DP in reflected light. The slides were then observed using ZEISS Aksioscope under PPL (polarised light), XPL (cross polarised light) and OIL (oblique incident light) at magnifications x2, x5, x10, x20, x40 and x63 at the School of Archaeology and Anthropology, ANU. The thin section description was conducted using the identification and quantification criteria for the related distribution and microstructure set out by Stoops (2021). After scanning and inspection, microstratigraphic units (MSUs) within the slide were identified based on sediment variation across the thin sections and differences in the presence and distribution of micromorphological attributes. This procedure allowed the identification of isolated and event-specific characteristics and the general interpretation of the slide. The thin sections were analysed for in situ phytoliths under PPL, XPL and fluorescent lights (UV and Blue) at magnifications x100, x200, 320, x500 and x800 following Vrydaghs and Devos (2018; 2020) and Kaczorek et al. (2018).

Portable x-Ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectra were collected throughout the centre of the north wall of

the Ormi 3 excavation<sup>1</sup> (Figure 4) at every  $5\mathrm{cm}$  from the ground surface to  $2.6\mathrm{m}$  depth at which point the sediments became so unconsolidated that assay collection was discontinued. We used a Bruker Tracer 5i hand-held instrument, which has a 4W Rh tube, maximum  $35\mu \mathrm{A}$  current at  $50\mathrm{kV}$ , and  $195\mu \mathrm{A}$  current at  $6\mathrm{kV}$ . Assays were collected for  $30\mathrm{s}$  in ambient atmosphere (i.e. no vacuum) at  $35\mu \mathrm{A}$  and  $50\mathrm{kV}$  with no filter in the beam path. Each spectrum was manually interrogated to identify if phosphorous was present either as part of a broad sum peak incorporating the Calcium escape peak at  $1.95\mathrm{keV}$ , or in high enough relative abundance to discern a clear phosphorous peak at  $2.01\mathrm{keV}$  (Frahm et al. 2016; Hunt and Speakman 2015).

Phosphorus is a well-used chemical proxy for human activity within archaeological sediments (Foecke, Queffelec, and Pickering 2024). Spectra were assessed using Bruker's proprietary instrument software, Instrument Tools version 1.5.0.95 and Artax version 8.0.0.443. Phosphorous abundance was classified as: not present (no peak); present in low abundance (part of the shoulder in a cumulative peak); relatively abundant (clearly present as a second peak in the sum peak); or abundant (clearly present as a single Kα peak with no broadening to suggest a calcium escape peak contribution). These qualitative characterisations of phosphorous abundance throughout the stratigraphy were then compared to the absolute quantitative chemistry measured in bulk samples and monoliths, focusing on the contact zones between stratigraphic SUs.

# Results

# Physical and Geochemical Results

The PSA results provide data on the sand, silt and clay fractions within each sample. At Ormi 3, the sand fraction exceeds  $90\%$  in SU 2 and SU 6. SUs 1, 2, 4 and 5 contain medium-to-coarse sands, while SU 6 consists of very coarse-to-coarse sand. This indicates a transition from bimodal particle size distributions in SU 5 to unimodal distributions in SU 6 (see Supplementary Online Material). There are relatively high silt percentages in SUs 1  $(32.9\%)$  and 5  $(28.6\%)$ . Clay fractions are low, with SU 5 having the highest composition at  $3.0\%$ ; next is SU 1 with  $1.3\%$ . Overall, these results indicate that the stratigraphic units are predominantly composed of sand and silt with minerals derived from the local tuff (Nutman et al. 2024).

The very coarse-to-coarse sands in SU 6 are suggestive of a higher energy environment of deposition, while the greater silt contents in SU 1 and SU 5 may indicate aeolian deposition. The clay may be incorporated into the stratigraphic profile when sediments have been exposed at the ground surface and subject

to pedogenesis, such as in SU 1 (topsoil) and upper section of SU 5 (potential paleosol).

Geochemical trends at Ormi 3 indicate a general decrease in TOC with depth, except for a slight increase in SU 4. These are consistent with low organic contributions during deposition within marine and aeolian environments, as well as increased degradation and leaching with depth (namely, with age). C/N ratios and Pt content inversely co-vary: C/N ratios generally increase down the profile, with a sight reversal in SU 5; while Pt generally decrease down the profile, with a slight reversal in SU 5. Pa is consistently low down the profile (Figure 6).

The C/N and Pt values in SU 5 are muted yet similar to those in SU 1. These values are consistent with the idea that SU 5 is a weathered paleosol, as proposed based on the high clay values in SU 5. However, any soil development within SU 5 was limited, with an immature A/C profile being suggested, namely, a weak A horizon formed on aeolian sediments in a foredune at the back of a beach during a short-lived period when the surface of the dune was stable. The pH measured was systematically above 7.

PSA results at Ormi 2 indicate very different types of sediment than at Ormi 3; they are much more clay and silt rich. This is further confirmed by the

similarity-indices (S.I.) which suggest that these are all different deposits (Table 3). In terms of soil texture: SU 1 is a silty loam; SU 2 is a silty loam; and SU 3 is a loam. The geochemical trends of Ormi 2 profile are similar, with decreases in TOC with depth, inverse co-varying of C/N and Pt and consistently low Pa (Figure 6). Nonetheless, these silt and clay-rich soils are very different than the marine and aeolian sands and silts at Ormi 3. Consequently, Ormi 2 is too different in terms of the composition of stratigraphic units to be a useful off-site comparator for Ormi 3.

We acknowledge the sampling practices and data processing for the pilot pXRF analysis reported here do not adhere to established best practice (Drake, MacDonald, and Lee 2022; Foecke, Queffelec, and Pickering 2024). Inclusion here is intended to demonstrate the complexities involved in field applications. Despite its limitations, the geochemical trends recorded by the pXRF are reported. Assays from the stratigraphic section were collected in situ, and the manufacturer's fundamental parameters approach (Bruker's proprietary software Artax version 8.0.0.443) was used to generate relative abundances for the measured elements, including low-Z elements of interest such as Si, P, and Ca

(Drake, MacDonald, and Lee 2022; Frahm et al. 2016; Hunt and Speakman 2015). Additionally, P is measured very superficially by pXRF and it is expected that P detection would be therefore heavily impacted by field and taphonomic conditions (Huntley 2012). Nevertheless, the trends in P measured in situ mirror and therefore corroborate those observed for bulk chemical measurements of P (Figure 7).

# Microstratigraphy Results

In total, eight MSUs were identified across the three thin sections: thin section A (TA); thin section B (TB); and thin section C (TC). The main characteristics of the MSUs are summarised in Table 4. Within these microstratigraphic units, pyroxene and olivine were identified (Nutman et al. 2024). This is also consistent with local geology (see Willmott et al. 1969).

# SUs 1-2

Thin section TA targets the boundary between SU 1 and SU 2 and identifies three different microstratigraphic units (MSU A1, A2 and A3; Figure 8; Table

4). The monolith sample was intended to assess whether the stratigraphy at Ormi had experienced a major erosional event (cf. Carter 2004) and/or a hiatus in cultural activity. The microstructure across the three MSUs varied from intergrain (MSU A1 and A2) to single grain-to-intergrain (MSU A3). No clear evidence of compaction was observed. Diagnostic inclusions are listed in Table 4. In MSU A2, SUs 1-2, the slide shows a soil fragment (WPM01, analysis of which can be found in Nutman et al. 2024). This soil fragment (WPM01), identified in MSU A2, was surrounded by unidentified bone micro fragments and fish scales, which are all indicative of human activity and sediment disturbance. This residual fragment of loam was not in situ and likely came from the nearby foundation rubble of the house's construction. There was no clear indication of an erosional hiatus within the microstratigraphy of this sample.

# SUs 4-5

Due to the difficulties related to the presence of the shell midden and roots, it was not possible to sample the boundaries between SU 2-3 and SUs 3-4; however, Monolith B sampled the boundary between SU 4 and SU 5. It was anticipated that this, coupled with results from Monolith C (described below), would better situate potential early cultural activities.

Monolith B and its derived thin section (TB) target the boundary between SU 4 and SU 5 and represent three different microstratigraphic units (MSU B1, B2 and B3, Figure 9; Table 4). Diagnostic inclusions are listed in Table 4. Dusty clay coatings decreased from the uppermost MSU B1 to the MSU B3.

with the single grain to intergrain (MSU B3) microstructure in SU 5, which corresponds to the macroscale difference between SU 4 and SU 5 identified in the field. The boundary between SU 4 and SU 5 could potentially exhibit characteristics suggestive of nascent soil development on aeolian sands, with subsequent accumulation of the midden (SU 3) on the stable land surface. The presence of (i) dusty clay coatings (pedogenic b-fabric) in SU 4 and (ii) the bimodal distribution of SU 5 (which differs from the bottom layer SU 6 and the layer above the shell midden) are consistent with this scenario.

# SUs 5-6

Monolith C and its associated thin section (TC) samples the boundary between SU 5 and SU 6 and identifies two

different microstratigraphic units (MSU C1 and C2; Figure 10; Table 4). The microstructure in the two MSUs varies between single grain to slightly pellicular in MSU C1 to single grain in MSU C2. These units exhibit primarily sedimentary characteristics with extremely limited (SU 5) to no (SU 6) pedogenic attributes. Diagnostic inclusions are listed in Table 4. There are reduced cultural materials present SU 5 and SU 6 in comparison to SU 4.

# Discussion

# Site Formation History

Field recording and multi-proxy geoarchaeological analysis have identified six successive stratigraphic units at Ormi 3 (Figure 11): mobile beach sand containing sporadic cultural materials (SU 6); aeolian sand accumulation, most likely an embryonic dune

above the intertidal zone (SU 5); nascent soil formation on a stable land surface on a foredune (SU 4); midden deposits mixed with aeolian sands, associated the main period of site use (SU 3); aeolian sands (SU 2); and the most recent topsoil formation on aeolian sands (SU 1).

# SUs 6-5: Beach sand Deposits and Temporary Occupations

Particle Size Analysis (PSA) results indicate a transition between SU 6 and SU 5 from unimodal to bimodal particle size distributions, which is indicative of different depositional processes. Similarity Indices (SI) further support this by demonstrating significant differences, indicating the presence of two distinct deposits (Table 3). The coarser sands in SU 6 likely

represent marine deposition on a beach or berm at the back of a beach, while the greater silt content in SU 5 plausibly represents aeolian redeposition of beach sands and silts in an embryonic dune above the intertidal zone. SU 5 contains slightly higher clay  $(3.0\%)$  and silt  $(6\%)$  contents compared to other SUs at Ormi 3, potentially suggesting incorporation into a formerly stable surface (Figure 6). Human activities were likely occurring in the vicinity given that both SUs contain fragments of bone, burnt bone and charcoal. The presence of micro-fragments of unidentified bones and burnt bones in SU 5 confirms the higher Pt value within the layer. P was also measured in low abundances in situ via pXRF. People were plausibly periodically visiting these local beach and dune environments, with increased frequencies of visitation within SU 5.

# SUs 5-4: Increase of Intensity of Human Occupation and Paleosol

Microstratigraphic analyses of the boundary between SU 5 and SU 4 indicate greater frequencies of crumb-like microaggregates in comparison to underlying layers. These aggregates are suggestive of nascent soil formation on the sand substrate (paleosol), which likely was a foredune accumulating behind a beach. The absence of clay within the PSA results for SU 4 does not accord with the observed microstratigraphic characteristics of this unit. This likely indicates that the unit is heterogeneous and that the PSA results are not representative of the unit as a whole. Dusty clay coatings and iron nodules provide further evidence for nascent paleosol formation within SU 5 to SU 4 (following Stoops, Marcelino, and Mees 2018) while intensification in human activities is indicated by an increase in phosphorous and nitrogen values in SU 4 and SU 5. In situ P, which is absent in the overlying SU 3, is consistently present in low-to-moderate abundance throughout SU 4 and present in mostly low abundances in SU 5. Soil formation, albeit weakly developed, would have required the land surface to be stable, such as would occur in a foredune environment. The presence of a stable land surface accords with the subsequent accumulation of a midden (SU 3).

In a similar way, previous research conducted by Carter (2004) identified a stratigraphic event linked

to more frequent occupation in the form of a shell midden within her Horizon III (Table 1). Carter (2004, 175) noted an abrupt sedimentary change between Horizons III and IV which she described as 'very dark grey, medium-grained sand with small angular rocks dispersed throughout' and interpreted this as a colluvial redeposition from the upper layers of the stratigraphy. She attributed this to widespread clearance activities leading to the destabilisation of upper-slope soils and the accumulation and infilling of the lower coastal embayments (Carter 2004). She raised the additional possibility that this event marks changes in vegetation patterns following initial settlement. A similar deposit was observed at Sokoli, associated with gardening activities (Carter and Lilley 2008; Parr and Carter 2003).

# SUs 2-1: Change of Human Occupation/Settlement Hiatus

The upper SUs (1 and 2) at Ormi 3 have been subject to active pedogenesis (see also Carter 2004), most likely from meso-fauna and root intrusion, which are common. P was measured consistently in low abundance with pXRF consistent with observed organic matter in the soil profile. Further evidence for disturbance is the soil fragment in SU 1; the microfabric of this sediment component is different to the surrounding groundmass. SU 1 and SU 2 likely

represent a combination of aeolian sand and reworked materials, including sands, from adjacent locations, either as a result of human agency, such as grading of land surface by people (i.e. Figure 1 and 2 illustrates the proximity between an existing dwelling and the Ormi 3 excavation) or colluvial processes.

Such hiatuses in the upper layers were also observed during the previous excavation at Ormi by Carter (2004). In her study, Horizons I-II indicated discontinuous dates of human settlement in the upper strata. Carter suggested these stratigraphic units were disturbed. Annual nesting turtles may have caused extensive deflation and dispersal of archaeological deposits across the foreshore, and it was considered plausible that nineteenth and twentieth-century house construction may have removed recent cultural deposits (Carter 2004, 172, 269). This may explain the discontinuity of the archaeological record at Ormi.

A similar pattern had been observed at Sokoli, where midden layers dating from 1650-1400 cal. BP indicated a significant decline in marine resource subsistence after 1650 cal BP (Carter 2004, 168, 318). Sokoli, like Ormi, experienced a decrease in marine exploitation over the past 1400 years, although limited cultural activities were recorded here between 900 and 700 cal. BP (Carter 2004) and at Teg on the east coast of Dauar (Wright and Van der Kolk 2019).

# Stratigraphic Implications on Cultural Activity at Ormi: Site Integrity at Ormi and the Provenance of Pottery Sherds

During the current investigations, one pottery sherd was found in beach sand (WPP003, SU 6, XU23) which yielded the earliest radiocarbon date from this site (Nutman et al. 2024). Pottery sherds were collected from stratigraphically similar deposits during previous excavations at Ormi and Sokoli (Carter 2004, 266). For Carter (2004), the presence of pottery and other cultural materials in Horizons IV and V suggested these were the earliest cultural deposits; however, she considered it possible that artefacts had been translocated from upper layers. Despite these uncertainties, she suggested an age range of 2600 cal. BP to 2000 cal. BP for the Ormi sherds deposited within Horizons IV-V (Carter 2004, 178).

High-resolution micro-geoarchaeological analyses of sediments at Ormi 3 suggest the shell midden and the SU 5-4 paleosol functioned as a 'seal' or 'cap' on lower layers (SU 5 and SU 6), making it highly unlikely that ceramic sherds moved from SUs 1-4 into SU 5 and SU 6 (following the rationale used by Macphail and McAvoy 2008). It is therefore likely that sherds below SU 4 from this site pre-date 2250-2000 cal. BP. Carter (2004, 158) observed that Horizon IV, which aligns with SU 5-4 paleosol in our excavation

(Table 1), was deposited rapidly and subsequently buried by the shell midden (Horizon III). This is clearly supported by micromorphological analyses, which show an apparent absence of bioturbation in SUs 5-6 compared to the upper layers. This process suggests SU 5 and SU 6 are intact because the paleosol was not exposed to pedoturbation processes before being buried by additional aeolian sands and the midden.

Could the sherd have been translocated from SU 5 to SU 6? The boundary between SU 5 and SU 6 is admittedly diffuse; however, PSA results reveal a bimodal particle size distribution in SU 5, contrasting with the unimodal distribution observed in SU 6. These two distribution patterns document different depositional modes; from beach accretion (SU 6) to a phase of probable aeolian accretion (Figure 11), characterised by a gradual increase in the intensity of human visits at the site (SU 5). Further, there are correlated increases in Pt, clay, and silt observed in SU 5 (Figure 6). Given that field pH measurements consistently exceeded 7, it is unlikely that Pt was mobile (Devos, Fechner, and Mikkelsen 2011; Holliday and Gartner 2007). While phosphorus released through the weathering of P-bearing minerals and plant residues typically accumulates in the clay fraction (Black 1968), and clay often migrates with Pt under certain conditions, this case also shows a notable peak associated with silt. This pattern indicates that the evenly distributed P likely reflects in situ accumulation within SU 5 rather than transported phosphorous due to downwards clay translocation. Although Pt results are not conclusive, as other factors may influence Pt mobilisation (Devos, Fechner, and Mikkelsen 2011), detailed micro-geoarchaeological analyses also suggest downward movement of the pottery sherd through the stratigraphic column is unlikely. Micromorphology in SU 6 shows no evidence of disturbance, including changes in microstructure from infill burrows (in material translocated downwards from above layers), bioturbation (roots, mesofaunal activities, etc.) or associated features (faecal pellets). Furthermore, no hypo-coatings or other evidence of potential in situ pedo-features are noticeable in SU 6. Consequently, the geoarchaeological investigations strongly suggest the SU 6 pottery sherd was deposited in sands at the back of a beach.

# Conclusion and Future Directions: Dauar Settlement Histories and the application of Micro-geoarchaeology in Island Contexts

The geoarchaeological investigation of the stratigraphy associated with a midden has enabled a refined interpretation of the formation processes at Ormi 3 and a more nuanced assessment of site integrity of Ormi. The lowermost layers, SU 6 and SU 5, are associated with the intact and earliest beach and

dune deposits, respectively, dated to approximately 2600–2250 cal. BP. The Ormi 3 midden (dated to 1900–1912 cal. BP) represents a period of site use comparable to the Sokoli one (Carter 2004). The reasons behind the disturbance of the upper layers (SUs 1–2) and the changes in occupation patterns at the site following the deposition of the shell midden still remain unclear. However, the use of the midden may signify a shift in subsistence strategies, with a greater emphasis on terrestrial resources – particularly arboreal and horticultural ones – complemented by marine resources. Further geoarchaeological research across the island is essential to definitively address questions regarding cultural continuity or discontinuity in the occupation of Dauar.

In summary, while it is difficult to rule out the reason for changes in occupation patterns throughout the upper layers at Ormi 3, the balance of evidence of current research suggests a reduction in the use of coastal sites on the island of Dauar during at least the past millennium. An explanation for this could be that Dauar was utilised discontinuously over time, with people moving to sites as yet unfound in the Dauar hinterland, or on the larger island of Mer. This movement may have been influenced by population growth and a shift toward the larger island of Mer, where horticulture became well-established, or by deliberate socio-political decisions creating complex cultural landscapes with significant roles for each island. At present, there is not enough data to document mobility patterns of these past groups from island to island within the archipelago. As a result, a broader application of micro-scale geoarchaeological techniques, alongside existing geomorphological data, is needed to fill this gap and pave the way for new interpretations and more refined occupation chronologies.
