# Abstract

Micromorphological analysis is used to improve our understanding of wetland site taphonomy and stratigraphy. Twelve profile columns from the Neolithic lakeshore site of Zug-Riedmatt are macroscopically described here, microscopic analyses are applied to sediment facies, defining 14 sedimentary units (U): The natural basal sediment (U1) is carbonate-rich, U2 a transition phase to the anthropogenic units U3 to U12. Uppermost are the natural carbonate-rich U13 and U14. The creation of a micromorphological database and the application of 27 defined indices allow a better understanding of the natural, anthropogenic and taphonomic processes taking place at the site. Natural sediment input originated from Lake Zug, the nearby river Lorze with its delta, and a local marshy waterbody. Organic rich accumulations and calcitic ash played a major role in pH changes, leading to carbonate and silica dissolution, alongside bone alteration. Signs of degradation processes under aerobic and anaerobic conditions within a single layer points to complex, multiphase processes under changing water levels, a milieu belonging to both land and water, an amphibious environment. Finally, good layer preservation seemingly correlates to low aquatic reworking in a stable depositional context linked to the marshy area.

# 1 | INTRODUCTION

After more than 150 years of lake dwelling discoveries in the Circum-Alpine region, wetland sites have been intensively investigated (c.f., Menotti, 2012; Menotti & O'Sullivan, 2015). Their position near water bodies, and thus waterlogging, provided excellent preservation conditions for organic remains. However, flooding from these water bodies can cause reworking and erosion of settlement deposits (Ismail-Meyer & Rentzel, 2017; Ismail-Meyer, Rentzel, & Wiemann, 2013). Multidisciplinary studies of lake dwelling sites have revealed much about these sites. For example, the dwellings and their construction, farming including animal and plant husbandry and accordingly the inhabitants' diet, hunting, crafts, and trading.

Simultaneously, dendrochronological analyses yielded exact dates for many settlements (e.g., Bleicher & Harb, 2015; Bleicher & Harb, 2017; Ebersbach, Ruckstuhl, & Bleicher, 2015; Harb & Bleicher, 2016; Jacomet, Leuzinger, & Schibler, 2004; Menotti & O'Sullivan, 2015; Menotti, 2012). Since the late 1970s, several sites have been analysed sedimentologically (e.g., Brochier, 1983; Joos, 1980) and in the 1990s, additional micromorphological analyses were adopted (e.g., Ismail-Meyer, 2014; Ismail-Meyer & Rentzel, 2004; Karkanas et al., 2011; Ostendorp, 1990; Pümpin, Wiemann, & Rentzel, 2015; Wallace, 1999). Pile-dwelling research has shown that in this wet-dry environment complex processes of preservation, degradation, reworking, and sedimentation occur. However, the details of these processes in relation to this

environment are still not well understood. Micromorphologically, there are still many important questions in the study of wetland environments: Have the cultural layers accumulated in standing water? How do flooding events impact cultural layers? Is it possible to reconstruct the depositional environment? Which taphonomic processes are the most important? In this paper based on extended micromorphological analyses and systematic data exploration of the Neolithic wetland site Zug-Riedmatt (Canton of Zug, Switzerland) attempts are made to answer these questions.

# 1.1 | The site Zug-Riedmatt

Today, the site of Zug-Riedmatt is situated inland about 700m from the current shoreline of Lake Zug and about 150m to the east of the ancient river Lorze, the main tributary of Lake Zug (Figure 1). Conglomerates of molasse sediments build the bedrock of the tectonic lake basin and its surroundings. Moraines of the last glaciation cover parts of the area. On the eastern side of the lake, steep slopes of molasse sediments reach more than 800m a.s.l, from which the Lorze flows into the lake. The modern course of the Lorze, an artificial canal

dug in 1973, possibly follows an older Lorze river bed (Geologischer Atlas der Schweiz, 2016; Kelts, 1978). The so-called "Alte Lorze" (old Lorze) is the last known original riverbed. The course of the Lorze during the Neolithic is not known, but indications suggest it was positioned on the eastern side of the archaeological site (E. Gross [personal communication]).

The sediments in the lake basin are glacial and glaciolacustrine deposits, and postglacial authigenic calcium carbonate accumulations known as lake marl (consisting of calcium carbonate crystals as micrite with crystal sizes  $< 4\mu \mathrm{m}$ , and sparite crystals  $>4\mu \mathrm{m}$ ; see Schnurrenberger, Russell, & Kelts, 2003). Most of the terrigenous input to the lake stems from the different streams, including the Lorze, which drain the molasse sediment formations. Lake Zug has a surface area of  $38\mathrm{km}^2$  and a maximum depth of  $199\mathrm{m}$ , with an internal flow rate of  $7 - 9\mathrm{m}^3/\mathrm{s}$  (approximately  $10\times$  lower than Lake

Zurich; Geologischer Atlas der Schweiz, 2016; Kelts, 1978). Previously the lake level was higher and a plain with Holocene lacustrine and deltaic sediments formed in the area between the modern towns of Zug and Cham. In 1592 AD drainage left the lake level  $2\mathrm{m}$  lower (Gross, Huber, Schaeren, de Capitani, & Reinhard, 2013; Kelts, 1978).

The archaeological site was discovered in 2006 during a bore hole survey for a building project. In 2008, an  $8 \times 8\mathrm{m}$  caisson assisted excavation was opened, as the cultural layers were covered by approximately  $6\mathrm{m}$  of limnic and deltaic deposits. The settlement layers lay between 411.50 and  $413.80\mathrm{m}$  a.s.l (modern surface:  $418\mathrm{m}$  a.s.l). The archaeological deposits, up to  $120\mathrm{cm}$  thick, accumulated on massive natural calcium carbonate sediments (Figure 2). The deposits lie within a grid of standing and lying wooden piles and comprise highly organic sediments interwoven with loamy, sandy, and ashy deposits. Based on extended core drilling the site is believed to

cover about  $3,200\mathrm{m}^2$  and is assigned to the Horgen period (Huber & Schaeren, 2009; pers. comms. E. Gross) and inhabited between 3,200 cal. BC (C14-dates) and 3,050 cal. BC (dendrodates).

Despite the small size of the excavation, it was extremely rich, uncovering more than 12,000 artefacts, 7,432 macrofaunal bones, and rich organic matter. The excellent preservation allowed for a dense profile sampling strategy, a total of 110 profile columns. A 3-year research grant led to "Formation and Taphonomy of Archaeological Wetland Deposits: Two Transdisciplinary Case Studies and their Impact on Lakeshore Archaeology" being undertaken. This included research into archaeology, micromorphology, geochemistry, archaeobotany, palynology, and archaeozooology with the aim to obtain more information on layer formation processes, preservation, and degradation in the wetland sites Zug-Riedmatt and Zürich-Parkhaus Opéra (Antolin et al., 2017; Steiner, 2017; Steiner et al., 2018). In 2011 the site was included in UNESCO World Cultural Heritage "Prehistoric Pile dwellings around the Alps."

Also presented here is a database that can systematically describe the micromorphological data collected at pile-dwelling sites (data available in article Supplementary Materials). Furthermore, we present the statistical exploration of these data, and thus the site formation processes, through the use of 27 defined indices that indicate natural sediment input, anthropogenic accumulations, and taphonomic processes. The aim is to visualise these processes before, during, and after layer formation.

# 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

Five strategic spots, one from each corner and the centre point of the excavation, comprising 12 profile columns were chosen (Figure 2). Each spot comprises 2-3 overlapping profile columns to a height of  $56\mathrm{cm}$ , covering the whole anthropogenic sequence and includes the limnic and deltaic layers just above and below these sequences. The columns were taken by pressing plastic boxes into the profiles after removing the surrounding sediment.

# 2.1 | Documentation of the profile columns

The profile column documentation was carried out in collaboration with the archaeobotanist and the on-site archaeologist. The deposits were divided into macroscopically recognizable beds (hereafter referred to as layers) and numbered from the base of the profile upwards starting at one.

# 2.1.1 | Location of the reference profiles

The 12 reference profile columns from five different spots have been grouped relative to their position, that is, lakeward, landward, and central (Figure 2).

# 2.1.2 Definition of units

Aligning the profile columns (and sections), with their clear stratifications (Figures 2 and 3a), next to each other uncovered 14 defined sedimentary units (U), which are seen throughout the entire excavation area. Lowermost are the basal lake deposits (U1) followed by U2 the transition to the first cultural sediments. Settlement deposits are labelled U3 to U12 which are sealed with the natural sediments U13 and U14. The organic micrite (MO) marker horizons are defined as U2, U4, U7, U10, and U12 (Figure 3a). Some of the settlement units are rich in organic matter (U3, U6, and U8), some rich in loam (U5, U9, U11, and U13). Units U3 to U6 are particularly rich in bones, which is attributed to a bone midden in the northeastern corner of the excavation (Billerbeck-Braschler, 2016).

# 2.1.3 | Definition of macroscopic facies

Macroscopic facies have been assigned by observing colour, bedding, texture, main constituents, and estimated calcium carbonate content (using  $15\%$  HCl; see Schnurrenberger et al., 2003). The following facies have been applied to each layer (see Table 1): organic rich sediments (O), layers rich in sand and gravels (S), loam-rich sediments (L); here loam defines a cultural loam mixture of clay and/or silt with added sand and gravel, layers rich in ash (A), organic micrite (MO) used as marker horizons, and micrite layers (M).

# 2.2 | Micromorphological sampling

For the micromorphological analyses, two or three subsamples have been taken from each of the 12 reference profile columns using plastic containers (25-30 cm length, 5-10 cm width, and 5-10 cm depth) (Figure 3b-c). The aim was to cover the whole cultural sequence including the transitions to and from the natural sediments. The subsamples have been air-dried and cast into epoxy resin under vacuum. After polymerization, they were cut into several sections with a diamond saw. To produce the  $30\mu \mathrm{m}$  thin sections, the sections were cut into  $47\times 47\mathrm{mm}$  blocks (Beckmann, 1997; Ismail-Meyer, 2014). A total of 90 thin sections have been analysed from the 12 reference profile columns containing 225 macroscopically recognizable layers.

# 2.3 | Micromorphological analyses and data collection

The thin sections were analysed using an optical microscope (Leica DMRXP,  $\times 16 - 630$  magnification) under plane-polarized, crossedpolarized and fluorescent light. First, the thin sections were correlated to the macroscopic layer documentation and then laminations within the 225 macroscopic layers were divided into 504 microlayers. The micromorphological descriptions follow the approach of

Bullock et al. (1985), Stoops (2003), Schnurrenberger et al. (2003), and Stoops, Marcelino, and Mees (2018). The data were recorded in a microsoft access database. Some restrictions in description had to be made, due to the large number of samples (see Table S1). The database contains the following parameters:

- External variables: Location (lake, centre, land), unit and thickness (in mm) of each microlayer (see Section 2.1; Table 1; Table S1).  
- Microscopic facies/subfacies (Table 1; Figures 4 and 5): Microlayers are assigned to a microscopic facies/subfacies according to the most common component, for example, micrite (Figure 4a-h), MO (Figure 4i-j), sand (Figure 4k-l), organic matter (Figure 5a-e), ash (Figure 5g,h), or loam (Figure 5i-l). Most components correspond to macroscopic facies (see Table 1; Section 2.1).  
- Semiquantitative variables: 32 semiquantitative variables were recorded for each microlayer (Schnurrenberger et al., 2003; Table S1). Describing the occurrence/strength of certain criteria,

such as clastic input (fluvial/deltaic origin), chemical sediments (authigenic carbonate crystals), and anthropogenic input (organic macroremains, charcoal, ash, bones, coprolites, loam) or the sharpness of layer contact. The following values were used: 0—absent/not observed; 1—weak/rarely present; 2—pronounced/regularly present; and 3—strong/dominant.  
- Presence/absence variables: 100 presence/absence variables were recorded (Table S1). This system was used for the appearance of additional characteristics, such as taphonomy of organic remains, sizes and shape of charcoal, specification of burnt elements and coprolites, taphonomy of bones, and loam matter.

The semiquantitative and presence/absence variables were grouped into eight classes: generals, aquatics (Figure 6), organics (Figure 7), charcoal and burnt elements (Figure 8), bones (Figure 9), coprolites (Figure 10), and loam (Figure 11). The definitions and literature are listed in Table S1 (additionally Table S2).

# 2.4 Indices

The frequency distribution of all semiquantitative and presence/absence variables is shown in Table S2. Due to the enormous quantity of data and variables, indices were constructed to allow simpler, yet more in depth statistical characterization. Twenty-seven indices covering the specific processes of natural,

anthropogenic, and taphonomic origin were defined (definitions are given in Table S1). These indices were created specifically for Zug-Riedmatt, that is, for a limnic, waterlogged environment and are formed by combination of specific semiquantitative and presence/absence variables, displayed as a sum of both. The index definitions are based on literature and characteristics of the observed data.

Natural environment indices linked to natural sediment sources:

- Micrite with characeae: Layered micritic sediments with a low sand content, rich in intact and well-preserved molluscs and characeae remains (after Brochier, 1983; Digerfeldt, Sandgren, & Olsson, 2007; Ismail-Meyer et al., 2013; Ostendorp, 1990; Platt & Wright, 1991; Schnurrenberger et al., 2003). Observations from the subfacies dense and loose micrite (mM1 and mM2) have been integrated into this index. This index indicates calm lake marl sedimentation below the wave base.  
- Micrite with degraded shells: Micritic sediment with sand, rich in fragmented and degraded mollusc shells, which points to a limnic sedimentation close to the shore with wave activity (after Brochier, 1983; Cutler, 1995; Digerfeldt et al., 2007; Ismail-Meyer et al., 2013; Ostendorp, 1990; Platt & Wright, 1991; Schnurrenberger et al., 2003; Wallace, 1999).  
- Organic detritus with sponges: Well-sorted, layered micrite sediment rich in organic detritus (or particulate organic matter), sponge remains, and caddisfly larvae. Observations obtained from the subfacies micrite with detritus (mM3) have been integrated into this index. The index indicates organic accumulation in a calm, protected environment, where sponges and caddisfly larvae were common, designated as a marshy waterbody environment.  
- Sand with aquatic plant seeds: Well-sorted fine sand deposits containing aquatic plant seeds (Nymphaceae sp., Najas sp., Nuphar lutea; see Table S1). Observations from the sandy micrite (mM4) and the sand-rich facies/subfacies (mS) have been integrated here. It denotes delta/fluvial input in an area which supported water plant growth.  
- Coarse sand: Poorly sorted sand with high c-ratios has been separated from sand with aquatic plant seeds. This index suggests anthropogenic processes leading to sand accumulation.

Total cultural indices comprise important anthropogenic contents and give a quick characterization of groups or layers:

- Cultural remains content: Non-natural remains, that is, remains that were brought in or deposited by anthropogenic activities in or near the site; a general overview of the anthropogenic input.

For example, construction loam, charcoal, organic macroremains, bones, and ash.

- Organic content: Any unburnt plant remains.  
- Macroremains content: Only remains that can be identified as wood/bark/twigs, leaves/needles, true grass remains, seeds/fruits, and mosses are included.  
- Burning signs: Diverse signs of heating, for example, charcoal, ash, heated bones, and burnt loam aggregates.  
- Loam content: (see Section 2.1).  
- Bone content  
- Coprolite content

Taphonomic indices include groups that give further information about preservation or taphonomic processes:

- Absence of aquatic influence: Layers that lack aquatic evidence and limnic micrite, but contain fragile anthropogenic components, as well-preserved calcitic ash (with pseudomorphs), bones, and angular charcoal.  
- Layer preservation: Anthropogenic remains indicating very good preservation conditions, for example, certain ash types, coprolites, and intact bones.  
- Compaction/trampling: Signs that indicate a compaction due to sediment overload and/or trampling.  
- Bioturbation: Disturbance due to root perturbation—probably recent (Bleicher, 2017, 224).

The following taphonomic indices are closely connected to a cultural index, for example, ash preservation indices are linked to burnt elements. To make the data comparable, these taphonomic indices have been recalculated taking into consideration the amount of the corresponding content.

Taphonomic indices connected to Total macroremain content:

- Aerobic degradation: Comprises all degradation signs that are connected to the presence of air, for example, mesofaunal droppings, fungal remains, including micro-fissured bones (after Babel, 1975; Craft, 2001; Huisman, 2009; Sebag et al., 2006; Turner-Walker & Jans, 2008). This group does not include aerobic organic degradation in oxygenated water (see Boyd & Tucker, 2012).

- Anaerobic degradation index: Degradation indicators that are connected to the presence of water/absence of air, such as gelified organic matter, including bones with cyanobacterial tunnelling (after Babel, 1975; Craft, 2001; Huisman, 2009; Sebag et al., 2006; Turner-Walker & Jans, 2008).

Taphonomic indices relevant to Total burning content:

- Calcitic ash: The sum of the calcitic ash pseudomorphs that would dissolve under low pH (Cabanes, Weiner, & Shahack-Gross, 2011; Canti, 2003; Mentzer, 2014; Polo-Diaz et al., 2016). This index signifies sedimentation in high pH conditions during sedimentation.  
- Neoformation of calcium carbonate: Indicates a drier environment during sedimentation as water saturated with calcite evaporates and a secondary carbonate precipitates from discarded ash (Friesem, Zaider, & Shahack-Gross, 2014; Karkanas, Bar-Yosef, Goldberg, & Weiner, 2000; Mentzer, 2014).  
- Non-calcareous ash: All ash-related types that dissolve under alkaline pH, such as plant silica from grasses, that is, phytoliths, silica slag from melted phytoliths, and phosphatized ash, which resists dissolution under low pH conditions (Cabanes et al., 2011; Canti, 2003; Mentzer, 2014; Polo-Diaz et al., 2016; Thy, Willcox, Barfod, & Fuller, 2015). This index hints at low pH conditions.  
- Loss of calcium carbonate: Includes sediments with very low calcium carbonate content or is devoid of carbonate.

Taphonomic indices connected to Total bone content:

- Well-preserved bones: Includes intact, in situ fragmented and fresh bones indicating quick covering.  
- Bones with burning signs: Bones showing reddening, calcined and reduced bones.  
- Bones with loss of collagen: Bones that show a phosphate-rich rim, where the collagen has degraded (Child, 1995; Dixon, Dawson, & Taylor, 2008; Hedges, 2002; Turner-Walker & Jans, 2008). This index shows microbial decomposition of bone under waterlogged conditions (Huisman, Ismail-Meyer, Sageidet, & Joosten, 2017).

- Poorly preserved bones: Bone fragments and splinters, microfissured bones, indicating reworking and changes between dry and wet phases.  
Taphonomic indices related to Total loam content:  
- Secondary processes in loam: Signs of postdepositional processes in loam deposits, such as decalcification and aggregate deformation.

# 2.5 | Group arrangement of microlayers

To better comprehend the collected data, microlayers were grouped according to specific criteria. The distribution of the indices across these groups could then be analysed. The criteria used were as follows:

- Location (Section 2.1, Figure 2).  
- Facies/subfacies (definitions see Table 1).  
- Units (Figures 2 and 4; Section 2.1).  
- Units and the combination of unit and location: The microlayers of a unit were also divided according to their location.  
- Unit groups: The settlement units (U2-U12) can be divided into anthropogenic and natural units (see Section 2.1): Anthropogenic unit group (U3, U5, U6, U8, U9, and U11) and the natural unit group (mMO, U2, U4, U7, U10, and U12).  
- Keyword-based group: The bone midden in the landward, northeastern corner of the excavation was a special deposit, so was assigned a keyword to the layers within it. Since the midden is contained within U3-U6, this assignation allowed the comparison of the microlayers within to those outside it.

# 2.6 Data exploration

For general data exploration, typical statistical and graphical methods have been used to visualize the data. That is, means for all semiquantitative criteria and percentage values for all

presence/absence criteria, also means have been calculated to compare different groupings of the defined indices (Table S1). In addition, factor analysis with varimax rotation was applied to all semi-quantitative and presence/absence indicators to check alternatives to the summary score composition. Factor analytic scores were calculated to assess any latent factors, which were then compared with the designed indices to highlight any correspondence between the two groups.

# 3 | RESULTS

The statistical analysis of the attributes can be found in Table S1. Only indices referenced to the microscopic facies/subfacies, the locations, the keyword bone midden, and unit groups are discussed here (Table 2). Taphonomic data for micrite rich sediments (mM) are not interpreted due to the small sample size.

# 3.1 | Facies analyses

The indices for the microscopic facies/subfacies analyses show highly differing mean values (Figure 12; Table 2 and Table S2).

Micrite rich layers:

Micrite rich layers (mM) can be divided into five subfacies with varying characteristics:

Dense micrite layers (mM1; Figure 4a,b) have high index values for micrite with Characeae and for micrite with degraded shells.

Loose micrite layers (mM2; Figure 4c,d) show values similar to the dense micrite layers with a highly reduced compaction index.

Micrite layers with organic detritus (mM3; Figure 4e,f) displays high values in micrite indices however, unlike the above, values for organic detritus with sponges and sand with aquatic plant seeds are also high.

Sandy micrite layers (mM4; Figure 4g,h) show lower levels of micrite and organic detritus indicators but scores higher on sand

indices. The cultural remains index shows higher values than the subfacies mM1 to mM3.

Organic micrite layers

Organic micrite layers (mMO; Figure 4i,j) have low micrite indices, but high organic detritus and sand indices. The cultural remains indices show low values in macroremains, burning, loam, and bone. Taphonomic indices suggest higher anaerobic degradation and poor bone preservation.

Sand rich layers

Sand rich layers (mS; Figure 4k,l) show a high c-ratio, decreased micrite indices, and high sand indices. Certain cultural indices are also quite high, such as burning evidence, loam, and bone. Taphonomic indices are high in non-calcareous ash (see Sections 2.1 and 2.4: Taphonomic indices to the total burning content), loss of carbonate, burnt bones, loss of bone collagen, and poor bone preservation.

Organic layers

Heterogeneous organic layers (mO1; Figure 5a,b) have a low micrite input, while the indices organic detritus with sponges and sand with aquatic plant seeds are elevated. All defined cultural indices are high. The taphonomic indices point towards a lower aquatic influence. Elevated values can be observed for non-calcareous ash, loss of calcium carbonate, well preserved and badly preserved bones, and compaction.

Homogeneous organic layers (mO2; Figure 5c,d) have the highest index in organic detritus and, compared with the heterogeneous organic mO1 sediments above, an elevated sand with aquatic plant seeds-index. The cultural indices are lower than in the mO1 sediments, with the exception of the total organic content. Moreover, except for a lower index for well-preserved bones and a higher compaction index, the taphonomic indices show values comparable to those of mO1.

Degraded organic layers (mO3; Figure 5e,f) show low micrite indices, alongside average organic detritus and sand indices. The degraded organic layers have the highest macroremain index within the cultural remain indices of all the facies. The taphonomic indices show the highest values in aerobic and anaerobic degradation indices, non-calcareous ash, loss of carbonate, and bioturbation.

The bone preservation is comparable with the mO1, however there are proportionally fewer well-preserved bones. Secondary processes in loam are much more pronounced than in other organic facies.

# Ash-rich layers

Ash-rich layers (mA; Figure 5g,h) display the lowest values for natural indices, except the coarse sand index. Cultural indices are generally high, especially burning signs, bones, and coprolites. The taphonomic indices; calcitic and neoformation of ash, wellpreserved bones, bones with burning signs and loss of collagen, and compaction are also high (see Sections 2.1 and 2.4: Taphonomic indices to the total burning content).

# Loam rich layers

Loam-rich layers (mL) were divided into two subfacies:

Heterogeneous loam layers (mL1; Figure 5i,j) generally exhibit low natural sediment indices. The cultural indices are high and except for high loam and lower bone content are comparable to mS. Taphonomy indicates the occurrence of some anaerobic degradation and loss of calcium carbonate. The bone preservation is characterized similarly to mO3. The loam exhibits high values for secondary processes.

Homogeneous loam-rich layers (mL2; Figure 5k,l): In comparison with mL1, both the natural and cultural indices are lower.

Taphonomic indices show high values in loss of calcium carbonate, secondary processes in loam, and compaction.

Summary for the facies analyses

The facies comparison clearly shows that the micrite indices differ between mM facies and the mainly anthropogenic facies, whereas the organic detritus with sponges index is much more uniform (Figure 12a). The anthropogenic remains show low values in the mM facies (Figure 12b). The layers' general taphonomy indicates that preservation is clearly correlated to aquatic influence, whilst bioturbation is a constant throughout (Figure 12c). The taphonomy of the organic matter suggests that both aerobic and anaerobic processes occurred within the same facies or layers (Figure 12d), while the pattern of certain ash occurrence, differs

greatly, and is dependent on the presence of calcitic and neoformed ash (Figure 12e). The pattern of bone taphonomy (Figure 12f), loam, and compaction indices (Figure 12g) all have consistent proportions across the facies.

# 3.2 | Location analyses

Natural indices display a similar pattern despite the differing locations, lake, centre and land (Table 2; Table S3). The landward section does, however, tend towards lower values (Figure 13a). The cultural indices are generally higher in the landward locations (Figure 13b), the exception being loam content, which

FIGURE 10 Coprolites. (a) Fragment of a possible sheep/goat coprolite showing a tendency to convolute structure on its right side. (b) Same as Figure 10a, XPL. The coprolite contains a few fine sand grains (bluish-grey grains). (c) Dung shred probably from a cattle coprolite due to its horizontal orientation of the remains, ZGRI 88 B1, PPL. (d) Same as Figure 10c, XPL. The sand content is very low, what points to cattle as well. (e) Phosphate-rich coprolite (greenish-brown parts) rich in bones (arrows), some of which show signs of digestion (reddish rim, left arrow). It is probably a fragment of a carnivore coprolite, ZGRI 68 A2, PPL. (f) Same as Figure 10e, XPL. Note the reddish-yellow fragments of flax seeds (arrow). The phosphate is opaque, while the bones show some birefringence. (g) Possible small rodent dropping, ZGRI 96 B1, PPL. (h) Same as Figure 10g, XPL. The dropping contains some fine sand grains. (i) Calcined dung containing some phosphate (arrow), ZGRI 88 B1, PPL. (j) Same as Figure 10i, XPL. Note the calcitic dung ash with a compacted rim (arrow). (k) Calcined dung with a compact rim (arrow) and rich in phosphate (orange colour, ZGRI 98 A4, PPL. (l) Same as Figure 10k, XPL. Secondary formation of rounded sparite can be recognized (in greenish-pink). PPL, plane-polarized; XPL, crossed-polarized; ZGRI, Zug-Riedmatt [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]

shows high values in both landward and lakeward sections. The taphonomic indices suggest that the landward layers are less influenced by aquatic events and better preserved (Figure 13c). The anaerobic degradation remains similar in all locations, whilst the central section tends toward a higher aerobic degradation index. Calcitic ash and neoformation of calcium carbonate show high values in the landward location. However, the non-calcitic ash and loss of carbonate index are higher in the central location. The bone indices are higher in the landward part; loss of collagen and poorly preserved bones show lower values towards the lake. The compaction index is highest in the landward section

(Figure 13c), whilst bioturbation is lower in the lakeward section compared with the central and landward areas.

The microlayers assigned to the bone midden were compared with those from U3 to U6 outside it (Table 2). The bone midden layers are lower in indices indicating natural sediments (Figure 13d). Despite the cultural indices being generally higher, the organic content is lower (Figure 13e). The preservation is

generally better in the bone midden, however anaerobic degradation was lower in non-midden layers (Figure 13f). Calcitic and neoformed ash indices are higher in the bone midden layers, whilst the non-calcitic ash and loss of carbonate indices are more pronounced outside the midden. All bone indices, secondary processes in loam and compaction indices are all higher in the midden layers.

# 3.4 Unit group analyses

The comparison between the natural units (U2, U4, U7, U10, and U12) and anthropogenic units (U3, U5, U6, U8, U9, and U11) showed the former to be higher in micrite and sand with aquatic plant seeds (Table 2; Table S3). However, the organic detritus index is similar in both groups (Figure 13g). The cultural indices, as to be expected, are

higher in the anthropogenic units, despite this, the total bone index is similar between the groups (Figure 13h). The taphonomic indices suggest that the anthropogenic units were less influenced by aquatic events but more prone to aerobic degradation. (Figure 13i). The anthropogenic units are also higher in indices for ash, well preserved bone, and bones showing loss of collagen. Secondary processes in loam and compaction are also higher in the anthropogenic groups. Presence of bones displaying signs of heating and poor preservation are analogous between groups.

# 3.5 | Factor analyses

Factor analyses confirmed that the indices summarise the data adequately. Five of the first ten factors that were identified by factor analysis with varimax rotation showed a correlation with at least one

of our indices ( $>0.7$ ). The remaining five showed correlation greater than 0.38. Thus, there is no evidence that reducing the data to indices overlooked any important latent factors.

# 4 | DISCUSSION

The discussion has been divided in to three sections, first the important features of the natural, anthropogenic accumulation processes and taphonomic changes are discussed with reference to published literature and index results from Zug-Riedmatt. This is followed by a reconstruction of the depositional processes. The second section discusses the natural environment of the site and anthropogenic actions within it. Finally, possible deposition scenarios are highlighted by applying the above to the 14 sedimentary units with the inclusion of some of the raw data (see Table S2).

# 4.1 Natural sediments

# 4.1.1 Micrite deposition

The index micrite with Characeae, which includes the mM1 and mM2 layer (Figure 4a-d) are interpreted as lake deposits (Seekreide or lake marl; Schnurrenberger et al., 2003). Precipitation occurred in calm areas through biogenic activity and/or physical changes in the lake water. Wave action and currents were low, and the water level was between 0.5 and 1 m deep (Brochier, 1983; Harrison & Digerfeldt, 1993; Kelts & Hsu, 1978; Schindler, 1976). In this setting, algal remains (Figures 4c,d and 6o-r), well preserved and intact mollusc shells are found. However, the index micrite with degraded shells and subfacies mM4 (Figure 4g,h) point to a deposition closer to the beach, water cover of less than  $0.5\mathrm{m}$ ; clastic sand accumulated due to a fluvial/deltaic input. Here, wave action accumulated sand and coarser elements, such as mollusc shells, which formed a lag

deposit (Platt & Wright, 1991). Fragmentation of these shells and signs of calcite/aragonite degradation (Figure 6a-e) indicates changing water levels (Cutler, 1995).

# 4.1.2 | Sand accumulation

The index sand with aquatic plant seeds overlaps with the facies mM4 and mM3 (Figure 4e-h) and suggests a deposition in a low energy floodplain, close to an active river channel. These fluvial processes accumulate allochthonous quartz grains (Digerfeldt et al., 2007; Harrison & Digerfeldt, 1993). The well-sorted, fine sand indicates a slow speed, at most  $1\mathrm{cm/s}$  (Hjulström-Sundborg diagram after; Press & Siever, 1994) and most probably formed in deltaic areas. The aquatic plant seeds (Figure 6m-p) discovered originate from lakes and rivers. However, further investigation shows that they were transported to the site alongside the fluvial/alluvial sand (see Table S2), thus, they most likely grew in deltaic areas of the river Lorze.

# 4.1.3 | Organic matter accumulation, detritus formation, and sponge growth

Analysis shows that organic detritus correlates with sponge remains and caddisfly larvae (see Table S2). The index organic detritus with sponges has high values in the facies mM3 (Figure 4e,f) and mMO (Figure 4i,j).

Accumulation of organic matter needs shallow, calm water, thus most likely occurred in a marshy waterbody connected to an active fluvial system with high sedimentation of terrestrial plants (Gastaldo & Demko, 2011). Organic matter accumulates in waterlogged and anaerobic conditions, falling water levels leads to the oxygenation of organic matter, followed by fungal, mesofaunal and bacterial activity forming the organic detritus (Figure 7j; Gastaldo & Demko, 2011; Lindsay, 2010). The sponge remains (Eunapius fragilis; pers. comms: T. Eggers; Figure 6i-l) consist mainly of spicules from decayed sponges, which are easily dispersed by water action. On-site sponge growth is attested to by the carpets of gemmules, which form when the sponge dies due to phases of seasonal stress. In this case sponges developed most likely on wooden piles in clear, still, freshwater (Eggers, 2001). The caddisfly larvae, observed in thin section as sand-covered silk cases (Figure 6q,r), most probably lived as detritivores or grazers on a water-covered ground rich in organic detritus (Maier & Linnenbach, 2001). In summary, organic matter would most probably accumulate in sheltered, still areas, for example, the marshy water-body fed by the river Lorze. Organic detritus formed as the water table dropped, however as the water table rose the organic detritus would be enriched with fluvial and/or limnic sediments, thus forming homogenized layers, such as mMO. In water-covered areas, caddisfly larvae lived on detritus and sponges grew on piles. Evidence from the sponge-growing season suggests that a flooding phase and thus high water table correlated to the snow melt in late spring/early summer (Keddy, 2010; Manconi & Pronzato, 2016).

# 4.2 | Anthropogenic sediments

The anthropogenic input is shown by the cultural indices. However, there is not a clear separation between anthropogenic and natural material within some indices. For example, the macroremain content index and the coarse sand index include naturally accumulated matter, as can be seen by their already elevated values in micrite facies (mM).

The cultural indices show low values in mM, but higher values of in the facies mMOand mS, alongside the highest values in the organic facies (mO1 to mO3; Figure 5a-f), ash-rich deposits (mA; Figure 5g,h), and loam-rich deposits (mL1 and mL2; Figure 5i-l). Obviously, the burning signs are highest in mA, but also highly prevalent in mO3 and mO1. The index coarse sand corresponds to other cultural indices and is assumed that the large majority stems from anthropogenic sources. This maybe from weathered loans, fractured gneisses, or temper for (pottery) clay and loam (see also Section 4.5).

The highly anthropogenic facies (mO1, mO2, mO3, mS, mA, mL1, and mL2) show remarkable consistency of the cultural index values, if the main characteristic is excluded from the comparison, for example, the index loam content in loam-rich facies. There are however three exceptions:

1) mL2 have lower cultural indices due the high proportion of loam within the analysed layers, thus other cultural remains are absent.  
2) mA and mO3 show higher coprolite contents. mA layers contain calcined dung remains (Figure 10i-l), which are absent or very rarely preserved in other sediments, except for mO3; these show high values of dung shreds, resembling highly degraded organic matter.  
3) mS layers contains more bones than the organic layers. However, this is a complex matter as the mAshow high bone content as well as being rich in coarse sand. Whether this is an archaeological feature or a taphonomic pattern will be discussed below (see Sections 4.3.4 and 4.5).

# 4.3 Taphonomic patterns

The taphonomic features will only be discussed with respect to facies with a distinct anthropogenic input (mMO, mS, mO1 to mO3, mA, mL1 and mL2), except for mM.

# 4.3.1 | Absence of aquatic influence and good preservation

The index values for the absence of aquatic influence and good preservation show similar patterns across the facies. This is in part due to the index definitions: fragile items, such as ash rhomboids (Figure 8a,b), are unlikely to be preserved after an aquatic reworking, whilst also being used as an indicator for good layer preservation (see Table S1; Section 2.4). However, this is negated as each index

contains several indicators and as raw data shows the same characteristics, for example, calcitic ash rhomboids or intact bones are present where aquatic elements are rare (see Table S2). Thus, it is safe to assume that aquatic events had an impact on the general preservation as the correlation demonstrates.

The lowest aquatic influence and the best layer preservation can be seen in mA. mO1 also show high preservation index values. However, despite little aquatic influence the mO3 are not very well preserved. The converse, high aquatic influence and poorer layer preservation can be observed in mO2, mL2, and mS. Some remains were quickly covered with the potential for excellent preservation.

# 4.3.2 | Aerobic and anaerobic degradation

Degradation indices for the facies clearly shows aerobic and anaerobic degradation throughout the site, though weaker in mL2, mMO, and mA. mO3 layers were strongly influenced by both degradation processes. The observation that both degradation processes were present in many layers indicates changing water level during and shortly after sedimentation. A high water table establishes anaerobic conditions and the accumulation of plant matter (Boyd & Tucker, 2012; Kenward & Hall, 2000; Mitsch & Gosselink, 2007). Once the water table drops below the level of organic material, aerobic bacterial, mesofaunal and fungal activity leads to the reduction of most plant parts into organic detritus (Gastaldo & Demko, 2011).

mMO is the result of a pre-sedimentary aerobic degradation process, not visible in the aerobic degradation index: syn- and post-sedimentary processes were mainly anaerobic. mA have been embedded and covered very quickly; all organic degradation processes stopped shortly after deposition. The location, lakeward or landward, seems to have only played a minor role in degradation patterns. To conclude, over the period studied there were constant seasonal water level changes throughout the site.

# 4.3.3 | Ash preservation patterns

In mA layers, and to a lesser degree in mL, calcitic, and neoformed ash (Figure 8a-f) display high values, while non-calcitic ash (Figure 8g-j) have lower values. This is an indication that during accumulation and covering of the ash, mostly drier and high pH conditions prevailed, including the partial loss of non-calcitic ash (Albert et al., 2008; Cabanes et al., 2011). The non-calcareous ash index has high values for every anthropogenic facies, the highest being organic layers (mO1 to mO3) and mS layers. Hence, pH conditions must have been low after sedimentation and calcitic ashes were not preserved (Albert et al., 2008; Cabanes et al., 2011). The index loss of carbonate correlates with the index for non-calcareous ash, these must have formed by the same process, but similar definitions also partly explain the correlation (see Table S1). Furthermore, there is a correlation to high organic

content of a layer. This indicates a drop in pH through anaerobic degradation of the accumulated organic content (Karkanas et al., 2000), which seems a common process throughout Zug-Riedmatt.

The results here and in Mentzer (2014) suggest the ashes in Zug-Riedmatt are dumped rake-out residues from fireplaces. Calcitic ash preservation indicates high pH conditions in a non-waterlogged environment under rapid accumulation, however the articulated phytoliths point to low pH conditions but also fast embedding (Cabanes et al., 2011; Friesem et al., 2014). Dissolution phenomena during and shortly after the embedding led to a loss of calcitic ash under low pH conditions, whilst a high pH resulted in a loss of the phytoliths (Blume et al., 2016; Karkanas et al., 2000; Osman, 2013).

# 4.3.4 | Bone preservation features

Bone taphonomy at Zug-Riedmatt suggests that low aquatic influence and good layer preservation relates to high index values of well-preserved bones (Figure 9a-d). These are generally observed in mA layers and the landward section. The indices loss of collagen and poorly preserved bones (Figure 9i-l) are not correlated to aerobic or anaerobic degradation, or the dissolution of carbonate. Thus, preservation was not from decay due to waterlogged or dry conditions. The highest values in collagen loss were in fact observed in mA and the bone midden, both of which are extremely rich in calcitic ash and bones with signs of burning (Figure 9e,f). Fresh wood ash are strongly alkaline, which accelerates collagen loss, and exposure of bones to fire produces a similar loss (Collins, Nielsen-Marsh, Hiller, Smith, & Roberts, 2002; Huisman et al., 2017). It can therefore be concluded that the main trigger of on-site collagen degradation was the presence of calcitic ash and prior heating of bones. It is possible that the index poor bone preservation shows the same relationship as the results are very similar. Furthermore, high bone content, burnt bones, loss of collagen and poorly preserved bones correlate with the index coarse sand: all are found in mA, mS and the bone midden. This suggests that coarse sand has the same origin as burnt bones and ash and can be regarded as cleaning residues from fireplaces. The sand itself is likely to stem from fractured heating stones, which were often of metamorphic origin, for example, gneisses (pers. comms E. Gross). Melted rims on coarse sand grains support this assertion (Figure 8k,l).

In summary, heated bones show collagen degradation through exposure to fresh ash. Furthermore, low aquatic influence and fast embedding were very important for good preservation of bone.

# 4.3.5 | Loan deformation

Evidence is observed of on-site secondary processes affecting the construction loam at Zug-Riedmatt, namely the presence of different

aggregate shapes (Figure 11g,h,k-n) alongside angular aggregates within the same layers (see Table S2).

The index for secondary processes in loam is especially pronounced in mL (Figure 5i-l), mO3 and mO1 layers, respectively. The taphonomic features show that loss of calcium carbonate is the trigger of secondary processes. Moreover, eluviated carbonate loam (Figure 11g,h) and organic rich clay probably resulted from decalcification of carbonate loam. Deformation did not occur due to the presence of organic matter, the mO2 do not show elevated deformation values. Clay minerals within the matrix might suggest local, strong homogenisation processes of unknown origin. Trampling and the presence of pottery clay in the layer might also be part of this process (Figure 11o,p). Angular loam aggregates often occur in mA layers and in the landward parts, which could be linked to a drier location during sedimentation.

Summing up, the observed aggregate shapes in mL layers seem to result from the loss of calcium carbonate during or shortly after deposition. The heterogeneity of the aggregate shapes precludes prevalent postsedimentary processes, such as sediment overload. Loam deformation caused by waterlogged conditions, as suggested by Bleicher (2013) and Knoll and Klamm (2015), played a minor role as lakeward positions do not show higher deformation rates than those central or landward (Figure 13).

# 4.3.6 | Compaction

The settlement layers of Zug-Riedmatt were covered with up to  $6\mathrm{m}$  of limnic and deltaic deposits. The weight of these sediments led to compression of the settlement layers, attested to by the deformation of standing piles. However, some compaction results cannot be explained by sediment overload. Dense lake marl (mM1; Figure 4a,b) is interspersed with loose lake marl layers (mM2; Figure 4c,d), which implies that the former is not a compacted version of the latter. Furthermore, in situ broken bones (Figure 9a,b) occur beside intact bones. Similarly, angular and flat loam aggregates occur in the same layers. These results negate sediment overload as the cause of fragmentation or deformation. Therefore, the effect of post-sedimentary compression is difficult to detect under the microscope, while location-specific patterns of synsedimentary compaction and trampling occur. Compaction is strong in mA, mL2, and mO2 layers. Higher values occur in the landward zone, which suggests that either trampling occurred in drier parts, or lower water content within the sediments, led to a better preservation of compaction/trampling features (Rentzel et al., 2017). Bone midden layers, especially ashy and loamy intercalations, show the highest compaction indicators, which could be due to trampling.

# 4.3.7 | Postsedimentary processes

In lakeside settlements, root disturbances are the most likely post-sedimentary processes, clearly taking place after deposition, as

recent reed belts developed along the lake's margins (Ismail-Meyer, 2014; Ismail-Meyer et al., 2013). For example, reed rhizomes in Neolithic layers at Zürich-Parkhaus Opéra, were 14C-dated to late Iron Age (Bleicher, 2017, 224).

The bioturbation index - recent root growth (Figure 7r) - shows consistent values throughout the facies, though more pronounced in the mO3, mL, and mA layers. Furthermore, lakeward locations show lower values than central and landward areas. The anthropogenic unit group exhibited slightly more bioturbation than those in the natural group.

These results show bioturbation as an overall phenomenon. However, it is more prevalent in landward parts, where a shallower sediment covers the settlement layers, allowing roots to reach nutrient-rich deposits more easily. Evidence suggests the disturbance of mO3 during sedimentation, perhaps indicating on-site plant growth.

# 4.4 | Environmental implications

The results show the influence of three natural depositional environments: limnic, fluvial/deltaic and calm sedimentation in a marshy waterbody (c.f. Steiner et al., 2018). These natural depositional environments, close to the site, are located in shallow areas of Lake Zug, between an active channel of the river Lorze, a Gilbert-type delta dominated by fine-grained river deposits, and an abandoned or blocked branch forming a river-fed waterbody (Gastaldo & Demko, 2011).

The stratigraphic sequences observations suggest the following conclusions:

(1) Many aquatic events influenced the overall deposition of settlement layers.  
(2) Several aquatic events in the area left traces or marked a hiatus. These were however limited as the rate of accumulation was higher than erosion.  
(3) There must have been protection for the lower, consolidated organic remains from new aquatic events. If not, the last aquatic event would have left a single homogeneous settlement layer consisting of anthropogenic and natural sediments. One explanation for this protection is the site placement within the lake body, the remains subsided to the sediment surface, so that accumulation was not affected by wave action and currents (Bleicher & Schubert, 2015). This hypothesis fits well for mMO and mO2 layers, however, the mO1 or mA do not show the expected sorting or loss of the fine remains that would be seen if deposited in water. A loam cover preventing the formation of a lag deposit was not always detected.  
This suggests that parts of the settlement layers accumulated without water covering.  
The pattern of superimposed layers, each showing an individual overprinting, could be explained using the

diplotelmic model of peat researchers. Peat consists of an upper, active, periodically aerated layer called acrotelm, which loses water quickly. The lower catotelm layer is permanently saturated and this water moves slowly. After rainfall,  $98\%$  of the water moves as runoff and near-surface flow through the top  $5\mathrm{cm}$  of peat (Grover & Baldrock, 2013; Holden & Burt, 2003). This implies that the water cannot enter the lower, waterlogged deposits and that erosion takes place only in aerated parts near the surface (c.f. Section 4.6; Ismail-Meyer & Rentzel, 2017).

(4) Large sections of layers have been exposed to anaerobic degradation under waterlogged conditions. Organic deposits can retain large amounts of water, up to  $90\%$  water by volume above the water table (Holden et al., 2006), so good layer preservation does not necessarily need a permanent water covering.  
(5) Signs of limnic influence have been erased due to the anoxic reducing conditions created by anaerobic organic decay. These anoxic conditions led to the dissolution of carbonate from calcitic ash, limnic micrite and mollusc shells.  
(6) Aerobic degradation indicates a lower water table within the site, which could be a sign of insufficient capillary action to raise the water table to the surface during these lower phases (Holden et al., 2006). A low water table results in desiccation and organic detritus formation, similar to the summer drying out of peat (Holden et al., 2006; Lindsay, 2010). The sediment pH measurements are no lower than  $6.7\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{CaCl}_2}$  (corresponding to  $7.2\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}}$  after Boesten, van der Linden, Beltam, & Pol, 2015), which means that some features, possibly clay particles, are buffering extreme pH conditions (Holden et al., 2006).  
(7) Flooding, most likely occurring in late spring/early summer due to melting snow (Keddy, 2010), led to sediment reworking and the deposition of natural sediments.  
(8) Winter processes, such as structural changes due to freezing, have not so far been observed. Also, it would be impossible to detect winter phases of low water table as snow cover, low temperatures, and decreased mesofaunal activity prevented degradation and erosion processes.  
(9) It is impossible to estimate the duration of a layer accumulation or a hiatus, as detailed dendrochronological data are still missing. However, it is obvious that different sedimentation processes have an influence on accumulation rates. Lake marl accumulation, for example, is approximately  $0.5\mathrm{mm}$  per annum (Kelts, 1978), but a storm event can quickly and unpredictably erode and redeposit such a layer (Brochier, 1983).

In conclusion, the formation of complex stratigraphic sequences through water action and sedimentation illustrate the shift in depositional environments from undisturbed high-water lake marl to low-water lake marl with deltaic/river input and the influential interactions of a local waterbody, where organic remains accumulated. The shift in depositional situation was most probably a regression of the lake level. This led to the progradation of the river Lorze delta

toward the lake and the formation of a calm, protected area, perhaps an intervee ee lake, where natural organic accumulation occurred. The waterbody was mainly fed by the river/delta, but, in higher water phases, water could also wash in from the lake. These different environments formed a delicate equilibrium, which was influenced by seasonal changes, with higher water table during late spring and lowering again during the summer. The natural and anthropogenic remains accumulated in a waterlogged milieu, through most of the year, characterized by high sedimentation rates and anaerobic decay. In the submerged areas of the waterbody sponges developed on the piles and caddisfly larvae lived on the organic detritus rich sediment surface. Several stronger flooding phases were attested to by the formation of homogeneous mMO layers containing eroded parts of older deposits. Episodes of low water table, led to aerobic degradation processes occurring mainly in the landward areas, causing organic detritus formation. Water action probably led to short distance translocation of this degraded matter, and fresh organic matter deposited. This resulted in highly heterogeneous preservation features that can be observed in many layers. Whether the settlement was protected from currents and wave action by a palisade, cannot be answered, but house constructions and lying piles may have influenced the water action during flooding phases.

# 4.5 | Anthropogenic processes

The varying content of the archaeological deposits gives evidence of complex anthropogenic actions. Organic macroremains can be the result of construction activities, agriculture, food preparation and consumption, foddering, fuelling, or insulation. Ash and charcoal stem from cooking, heating, and possibly conflagration. Bones and coprolites give evidence of animal husbandry, hunting, fishing, and the inhabitants' diet. Clay and loam were brought to the site for construction purposes and pottery production. The data here allows us to pinpoint some specific activities.

(1) Organic matter was mainly anthropogenic; however, some organic matter, especially parts of wood, bark, or twigs and leaves or needles, could also be of natural origin and even brought in by the river or lake. The organic matter that accumulated through aerobic processes, formed the organic detritus could be of either anthropogenic and/or natural origin.  
(2) Burning residues show that fuel consisted not only of wood, but also leaves, remains of true grasses (i.e., straw, husks), herbivore dung (silica slag, calcined coprolites), and possibly bones. Several investigations show that herbivore dung was especially important as a fuel in cooking (Braadbaart, van Brussel, van Os, & Elijskoot, 2017; Gur-Arieh et al., 2014). Parts of bones were also directly exposed to fire (calcined and reduced bones). It is known that bone fires produce high and stable temperatures (Costamagno, Théry-Parisot, Brugal, & Guibert, 2005). Whether these bones were also used as fuel cannot be answered. Furthermore, ash, sand, and

bone were often deposited together, suggesting fireplace residues that are raked-out and dumped (Mentzer, 2014). These remains could originate from food preparation or ceramic firing (pers. comms R. Frosdick). The sand, grains of which had melted rims, might have become detached from the hearth constructions or stem from brittles of metamorphic heating stones such as gneisses (see also Section 4.3.4). The quartz grains with melted rims suggest that temperatures were up to  $1000^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  (Courty, Goldberg, & Macphail, 1989). Similar sand grains accumulated in ash of a Lithuanian lakeside settlement, where sandstone was used as heating stones (Ismail-Meyer, 2014).

(3) The bone midden in the landward part of the excavation was formed over several events. First, large quantities of bones mainly from red deer accumulated in an open and waterlogged area, where in a short period cyanobacteria attacked the bone surfaces exposed to light (pers. comms. Turner-Walker & Jans, 2008). Next, the bones were quickly covered with fresh ash, mosses, and fish remains. The ash suggesting a drier environment at that time. Calcitic ash led to a loss of bone collagen, the bones may have also been burnt before deposition (c.f. Huisman et al., 2017).  
(4) Coprolites (after Bronnimann, Pümpin, Ismail-Meyer, & Rentzel, (2017); Bronnimann, Ismail-Meyer, Rentzel, Pümpin, & Lisa (2017)), which are found regularly in other lakeside settlements, were very rare here. The exception being dung ash, which probably goes back to burned herbivorous dung and calcined coprolites. There are several explanations for the rarity of coprolites. First, unburnt coprolites probably decayed long before sedimentation. Second, few domestic animals were present and probably those few were kept away from the area. Or thirdly, herbivorous dung was collected for fuel. Those coprolites found on site, observed in U5, U6, and U8, stem mostly from cattle. Archaeozoological investigations show that cattle bones are regularly found throughout U6 to U13. Almost no traces of pig coprolites were identified despite being the most important domestic animal at the site. However, porcine coprolites are very fragile, thus not preserved or difficult to detect. Dog bones were most prevalent in U6 and U7, whilst their coprolites peak in U5. Sheep and goat bones were extremely rare, and their coprolites rarer still (Billerbeck-Braschler, 2016; Table S2). In conclusion, the animal bones and their corresponding coprolites relate well, so that the low number of coprolites is mainly explained by the reduced presence of domestic animals within the analysed part of the site. This is most likely due to waterlogged areas being unfavourable for livestock.  
(5) Construction clay and loam were gathered from deposits going back to the river Lorze (Figure 11a-f), that is, clay originating from luvisol horizons. Moreover, carbonate silts from floodplain overbank deposits, which show signs of soil formation, were also often used. Both materials were tempered with fluvial sand and gravel. The absence of organic temper suggests that

the loam was not used as daub for wattled walls, but rather for floors, fireplaces, and/or ovens, the coarse silica sand and gravel making a better heat-resistant material (Knoll & Klamm, 2015). In fact, highly burnt loam aggregates most probably originate from fireplaces (Figure 11i,j). In most layers, the consistently observed clay and loam aggregates are likely from fireplaces and floors and found in the sediments through discarded remnants of cleaning and sweeping (Mentzer, 2014).

(6) Homogeneous loam layers with quartz sand temper (Figure 5k,l) show no compacted surfaces and therefore were not evidence of in situ preserved house floors. These loam layers might be the result of collapsed houses, conserved reddening suggests contact with fire (c.f. Friesem et al., 2014). For this reason, we suppose that the houses were constructed above ground level, protected from flooding. Furthermore, continuous layers stretching long distances within the profiles also indicate elevated house constructions. On the other hand, ground-level houses would have interfered with the deposition of aquatic deposits, allowing a differentiation between interior and exterior areas.  
(7) Ceramic production used clay material from molasse sediments (Figure 11o-r), with coarse, crushed gneiss as temper. Pottery was produced on site as indicated by unburnt aggregates of molasse sediment with and without tempering (Figure 11o,p).  
(8) Anthropogenic accumulation rates cannot be estimated without detailed dendrochronological dating. Rates were perhaps high during the growing season and reduced in winter.  
(9) Classic trampling features have so far not been observed. There are however, indications that flattened loam aggregates and in situ-broken bones are the result of compaction during and shortly after sedimentation and this may lead back to trampling (Miller, 2017; Section 4.3.6).  
(10) The abandonment of the site has so far not been reconstructed. There is no other evidence of conflagration, despite the reddening observed on loam layers. Nevertheless, such events are difficult to detect, since burning residues like charcoal and ash are quickly removed by flooding (Canti, 2003; Macphail, Allen, Crowther, Cruise, & Whittaker, 2010).

# 4.6 Reconstruction of formation processes

So far, archaeological evidence indicates three or four interrupted settlement phases. The first settlement spanning U2 to U5, the second phase from U6 to U7. U8/U9 suggests a possible third settlement and a final settlement, with only sparse loam accumulations in U11.

During the sedimentation of U1, the settlement area was in the littoral zone; layered authigenic carbonates accumulated in an area permanently covered by water and influenced by the nearby Lorze delta. Towards the top of the limnic sediment and landwards, there are signs of subaerial sediment exposure, which indicates the near shore. There are discrete traces of human activity.

A major environmental change occurred at the beginning of the deposition of U2. The lake level lowered, the river Lorze delta

prograded towards the lake, and a local marshy waterbody developed in a distal deltaic zone or an abandoned river channel, perhaps an

oxbow lake. The waterbody was characterized by organic sedimentation and organic detritus formation during drier phases. There was still a strong limnic influence; however, accumulation in the marshy waterbody and fluvial sedimentation increased slightly. The presence of humans becomes more evident, especially landwards. The first settlement houses were possibly constructed close to the excavated area.

Deposits from U3 show a decreased lake influence, whilst the marshy waterbody showed active fluvial input and strong sedimentation. This unit is rich in anthropogenic residues, such as macromains, loam, and ash, even in the lakeward area. The excavation area is clearly situated within the settlement with a strong anthropogenic evidence beside and below the houses. The landward part was rather dry, while low pH conditions in the wetter central and lakeward part led to loss of calcitic ash.

Deposition of U4 indicates the rising level of the lake, leading to an in situ lake marl forming in the central and lakeward area. Nevertheless, the influence from the local waterbody and the fluvial sedimentation remained strong. Loans, organic remains, and bones from U3 were eroded, reworked, and deposited with natural sediments, especially in the lakeward areas.

U5 is dominated by bones, ash, mosses, and loam. There is a decreased influence from the lake, the natural marshy waterbody and fluvial sedimentation. Landwards, well-preserved calcitic ash are observed, responsible for bone collagen degradation. This, together with a higher compaction rate, suggest a rather dry environment in landward area, while low pH conditions led to decalcification of the deposits in the central and lakeward parts.

Layer U6, a highly anthropogenic, organic-rich sediment, shows a slightly stronger influence from the marshy waterbody and river than in U5. Aerobic and anaerobic degradation processes, as well as strong calcium carbonate loss overprinted the deposits. Archaeological and botanical evidence indicate a new settlement phase.

U7 is characterized by a strong influence from the river and marshy waterbody, and a slightly increased impact from the lake. Erosional forces, in the landward part, led to the reworking of anthropogenic remains, especially bone, resulting in poor bone preservation.

Deposition of U8 saw decreased sedimentation from the river and lake, whilst sedimentation in the marshy waterbody remained strong. The anthropogenic influence became stronger again, especially in the landward part. The aquatic influence was low and calcitic ash indicate a dry environment with rapid accumulation, leading to good bone preservation. In the central part, there was a particularly strong influence from aerobic and anaerobic degradation, loss of bone collagen, and dissolution of calcium carbonate.

U9 consists mainly of loam and a low natural sedimentation input. The lakeside area is characterized by a marshy waterbody-milieu with weak lake influence. Aerobic and anaerobic degradation processes are weaker than previously in U8. The presence of calcitic ash,

even lakeward, suggests alkaline and drier deposition phases. In the lakeward area, bone preservation conditions improved compared with the landward areas. Secondary processes in loam and compaction features predominate. It is possible that U8 and U9 belong to a third settlement phase.

The deposits of U10 point towards increased natural input from all three water sources. The amount of cultural remains is high, especially the bone content.

U11 is the last settlement phase that can be reconstructed. Sedimentation shows diminished influence from the lake. The marshy waterbody sedimentation and river input remains similar to U10. The loam content is comparable to that in U9. The improved general layer preservation compared with U9 and U10 deposition was indicated by the higher values of calcitic ash and well-preserved bones. This suggests some drier phases in U11, during which the remains were covered relatively quickly, perhaps due to the vast quantities of loam being discarded.

U12, relative to U11, shows a slight increase, in marshy water-body and fluvial sedimentation. Cultural remains are still relatively abundant. Aerobic and anaerobic degradation as well as loss of calcium carbonate in the landward area were extreme. Bones were only rarely identified and were poorly preserved. The settlement, at this moment, was most probably abandoned.

U13 represents a distinct increase in lake influence, whilst marshy waterbody sedimentation decreased. The fluvial input however remained strong. The active river channel was now very close to the southeastern corner of the excavation. The total cultural remains decrease especially in the lakeward and central locations. Landwards, aerobic degradation is strong, which indicates a shift in lake levels. Bone preservation shows varying degrees, some being well preserved and buried in the natural sediment.

U14 shows a heavy lake transgression with lake marl across the entirety of the analysed area. The river input and the marshy waterbody-sedimentation remained high, higher than in U1. The few bones present are clearly reworked and poorly preserved (Figure 14).

# 5 | SUMMARY OF THE SITE FORMATION PROCESSES

The  $8 \times 8$  m excavation area of Zug-Riedmatt offers a detailed view of the site formation processes both natural and anthropogenic and highlights the differences between lakeward, central, and landward locations over a short distance. In areas close to lakes, rivers, or deltas, a change in water level can significantly affect the sedimentary record, as the littoral zone and deltaic area adjust (Harrison & Digerfeldt, 1993; Table 2; Figure 14).

- The first recorded phase (U1) is a long-term lake marl precipitation that formed a carbonate-rich platform in the beach area; influence is also seen from the river Lorze delta.

FIGURE 14 Mean values of indices by unit, from the basal U1 to the covering U14. Sand and organic detritus sedimentation were rather constant compared with the micrite deposition and cultural remains accumulation. The cultural remain content differs rather strongly across the units. Absence of aquatic influence and layer preservation correlate strongly. Aerobic and anaerobic degradation were rather constant across all units. Ashes show highly differing pattern regarding calcitic ashes and neoformation of calcium carbonate. Loss of bone collagen showed a strong connection to certain units, related to the presence of ashes generally. Poorly preserved and burnt bones occurred everywhere. Coprolites were rare in all units. Secondary processes in loam and compaction is an overall process. They might be correlated to each other. By K. Ismail-Meyer [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]

- The progradation of the delta zone, probably related to a lower lake level, led to a calm, marshy waterbody in a distal deltaic zone or abandoned part of a river channel (Gastaldo & Demko, 2011). Seasonal changes in lake level and river input produced organic sedimentation and degradation phases. A settlement developed in the landward area of this marshy waterbody and due to a wide range of settlement activities, led to increased accumulation of wood, diverse organic remains, burning residues, and loam aggregates (U2).  
- In the following phase (U3) accumulation between and beneath the first settlement dwellings took place. Furthermore, the first clear signs of drier phases are observed. Discarded ash negatively affected bone preservation and the accumulation of organic matter led to a decrease in pH, dissolving carbonates.  
- A lake driven aquatic event led to erosion and reworking of settlement remains, especially in the lakeward area. So, it is assumed a short-term flooding rather than a longer phase of settlement abandonment (U4).  
- A phase of intense habitation followed (U5), leading to extremely rich accumulations of bone and ash. The sedimentation rate was probably very high leading to quick covering and excellent preservation. This preservation indicates a short first phase of higher water level, followed by a decrease that led to large accumulations of ash, small animal remains, and mosses in a bone midden.

- The following deposits (U6) mark the beginnings of a second settlement with anthropogenic remains accumulated in a calm but increasingly deltaic-influenced environment. Large organic-rich deposits led to excessive dissolution of carbonates.  
- Another aquatic event, this time riverine, affected the whole settlement area, reworking parts of the settlement accumulations (U7).  
- The next phase (U8) hints at a third settlement, which is characterized by strong anthropogenic accumulations with a lower deltaic input. Large amounts of ash are observed, which affected bone preservation. Periods of low pH and aerobic and anaerobic degradation are observed in the lakeward and central areas, whilst landwards, dry phases dominate.  
- High quantities of calcareous loam were deposited during the next phase (U9). Most probably, belonging to refuse from repeated hearth construction (pers. comms. E. Gross). A third phase of flooding caused by both river and lake again reworked parts of the older deposits (U10).  
- The next phase (U11), another loam-rich layer accumulated in a marshy waterbody and delta-influenced milieu with only minor lake input. It is likely that these loams stem from a house collapse, attributed to the final settlement phase (U11).

- Later (U12) the influence from the delta and the lake increased, and accumulated anthropogenic remains show signs of strong degradation. It is possible the site was already abandoned.  
- The limnic influence grew in importance, while the delta input remained strong and the protected situation of the marshy waterbody decreased. In the southeastern corner of the site, a lag deposit indicates a nearby active river channel (Gastaldo & Demko, 2011). Generally, the anthropogenic accumulations also decreased, especially in the central and lakeward locations. Well preserved bones still appear in the landward areas (U13).  
- The last phase (U14) indicates high but fluctuating lake levels near the river Lorze delta, with some sedimentation in the marshy waterbody. Only a few reworked settlement remains have been observed.

In conclusion, the Zug-Riedmatt settlement was likely built after a lake regression in a calm, deltaic zone close to the lakeshore. High sedimentation rates and waterlogging led to the formation of well-preserved settlement layers. The area belonged to both land and water, characterised as wet during the spring floods, and drier phases during summer. So far, the archaeological evidence indicates three or four settlement phases, broken by hiatuses. The first settlement lasted from U2 to U5, the second from U6 to U7. A possible third settlement is suggested in U8/U9 and only some loam accumulations indicate the final settlement in U11.

# 6 | FUTURE IMPLICATIONS

The Zug-Riedmatt project has shown the importance of an accurate correlation between macroscopic profile description, thin sections, and the correlation within an interdisciplinary framework. A problem in analysing large data sets is giving each item the same importance. This cannot be solved with the use of a database alone, but rather a final adjustment of the layer description. The general database architecture presented here is useful and the extended data calculations were shown to be important. The application of indices especially helped in understanding the fluctuating importance and processes of the natural events, anthropogenic deposits, and taphonomy. For future projects with waterlogged features, the use of indices may make it possible to directly describe some phenomena. However, it is important to make the indices site-specific, so they must be crosschecked, substantiated, adjusted, and refined.

This research yielded information about the natural depositional environments between Lake Zug and the river Lorze, which led to the development of a local marshy waterbody. Organic accumulations have their own properties regarding water retention and run-off events. Furthermore, accumulations of organic matter and calcitic ash were the stimuli of important taphonomic changes, such as lowering pH, carbonate loss, and bone degradation. In addition, it was shown that water action is an important factor leading to poor preservation of settlement layers. Further research into the importance of trampling, deformation of loam, as well as naturally accumulated organic matter within the settlement is needed to fully understand

these processes. Seasonal processes also need more attention. Sedimentation rates are another issue of interest and import but their calculation would first require dendrochronological dating. So, it can be seen there is still much to be discovered from the already vast data collected from and archaeologically within the Zug-Riedmatt site and surroundings.
