# 1. Introduction

The aim of micropedology is to contribute to solving problems related to the genesis, classification and management of soils, including soil characterisation in palaeopedology and archaeology. The interpretation of features observed in thin sections is the most important part of this type of research, based on an objective detailed analysis and description.

Attempts to understand soil genesis by the study of thin sections were already made in the beginning of the 20th century by Delage and Lagatu (1904), Lacroix (1913), Agafonoff (1929, 1935/1936, 1936) and Allen (1930), but it was only after the publication of the book Micropedology (Kubiëna, 1938) that a real start was made. The use of micromorphology was promoted further by Kubiëna's later books on soil genesis and classification (Kubiëna, 1948, 1953; see also Stoops, 2009a). New methodologies to prepare large thin sections with cold-setting resins (Borchert, 1961; Altemüller, 1962;

Jongerius & Heintzberger, 1962) allowed the study of microstructures and other relatively large features. In the course of the following years, much progress was made in methods of thin section description (Brewer, 1964; FitzPatrick, 1984, 1993; Bullock et al., 1985; Stoops, 2003) and quantitative analyses (Kubiëna, 1967; Jongerius, 1974; Mermut & Norton, 1992; Terribile et al., 1997; see also Stoops, 2009b). The interpretation of micromorphological features of various soil and regolith materials advanced as well, but no general overview of these achievements had been compiled before publication of the first edition of this book.

The evolution of micromorphological publications, from 1900 until 2000, was analysed by Stoops (2014) based on bibliometric data. In the following paragraphs, an update until 2015, using the same methodology as described in the original paper and completed with many overlooked references, is presented. After publication of the book by Kubiëna (1938), the number of publications continuously increased, especially since 1956, reaching a maximum in the period 1986-1990 (Fig. 1) and decreasing thereafter slightly for various reasons (Stoops, 2014).

Besides changes in the number of micromorphological publications, also the fields of research that they represent strongly varied since its inception (Fig. 2). Before 1940, publications on methodology and concepts were dominant, followed by soil genesis. Soil genesis became the main application after 1940, reaching a maximum in the period 1956-1960 (80%) and still accounting for more than 50% until 1996-2005. During and after this period, a gradual increase in the number of publications on archaeological

and palaeopedological topics was observed, and from 2011 onwards, these fields of research together account for more than  $50\%$  of all micromorphological publications.

With regard to the language of publication, it was only after 1970 that English definitely passed the threshold of  $50\%$ , which has now increased to more than  $90\%$ . Before 1970, many papers were written in German ( $>50\%$  in the period 1941-1950) and also in French, Spanish and Russian, besides other languages such as Czech, Dutch, Hungarian, Portuguese and Polish, representing the countries where micromorphology was strongly developed as field of research. The loss of this linguistic diversity represents a real impoverishment, for example, in the creation and formulation of concepts.

Several difficulties are encountered when making a synthesis of existing literature data on micromorphological characteristics of materials and horizons in relation to their genesis and classification (Stoops, 2001):

- Most published micromorphological descriptions are unavoidably incomplete, mentioning only the most relevant, striking or 'diagnostic' features, or only those that the author was able to recognise. The most complete descriptions can be found in reports and dissertations.

- The micromorphological terminology used is frequently not sufficiently precise, in some cases partly consisting of an author's own descriptive system without well-defined concepts. The use of a standardised and uniform terminology is therefore very important. The influential system of Brewer (1964) is still in use by some authors, but more widely accepted modern terminology (Bullock et al., 1985; Stoops, 2003) is now recommended. The latter has been translated into more than 15 languages, producing lists of terms that have been made available online.  
- Soils or materials studied in thin sections are often not sufficiently precisely identified (e.g., 'a brown soil') or they are classified according to often poorly accessible national systems. The many changes through time in classification criteria used in the different versions of the FAO-WRB and USDA systems also strongly hinder correlation between soil type and micromorphological characteristics, based on papers published over periods of several decades.  
- Horizons or layers that are not considered as diagnostic or interesting are generally not described. For instance, practically no micromorphological information is available on cambic horizons occurring together with other diagnostic horizons in a same profile, or on aspects of surface horizons other than their microstructure characteristics.  
- In several publications only interpretations are given, not supported by detailed descriptions, and therefore making it impossible to use the data for comparison or for database construction.

The general significance of certain micromorphological features can be explained rather easily, for example when relating the presence of clay coatings to the process of clay illuviation. For many other features, the interpretation is less straightforward. In many cases the combined occurrence of features, or the absence of a certain feature, is more diagnostic than the presence of individual features. For instance, fine granular microstructures and an undifferentiated b-fabric are found in oxic, andic and spodic materials. If the field context is poorly known, the presence and abundance of volcanic components, weatherable minerals and fine organic matter allow differentiation between these materials.

Interpretation of micromorphological characteristics is based on comparison between the recognised features and field observations, laboratory analysis results, and results of experimental studies. In the case of palaeosols, comparing features of buried or relict soils with those in present-day soils is evidently a must. In archaeology, the study of modern analogues is also useful.

For a full understanding of soil and regolith thin sections, sufficient knowledge of polarised light microscopy and optical mineralogy, as well as a basic knowledge of petrography, is needed. This knowledge is often missing among certain groups of researchers such as archaeologists (see Shahack-Gross, 2015) and soil scientists with a background in agricultural studies.

For all these reasons it is not possible to relate, in a simple way, micromorphological characteristics with genesis, classification or physical, chemical and mineralogical properties. Much systematic research is therefore still needed.

# 2. Soil and Regolith Genesis

Micromorphology has been applied mainly in view of disentangling processes of soil and regolith formation.

Before publication of the first edition of this book (Stoops et al., 2010), review papers on the micromorphological characteristics of different soil types were available in volumes edited by Bullock and Murphy (1983) and Douglas and Thompson (1985). Other reviews are scarce, and they are scattered over various scientific journals and congress proceedings. Many of them suffer from the fact that their authors are acquainted only with the literature published in their own language or country. There is also a considerable risk that in future reviews only publications that are registered or available online will be taken into consideration. As a result, much useful information can be lost. Early Russian knowledge on the interpretation of soil micromorphology was summarised by Parfenova and Yarilova (1965) and widely used after translation, whereas no translation is available of the more recent volume by Romeshkevich and Gerasimova (1982). The English-language book by Gerasimova et al. (1996) on Russia and adjacent countries has not been widely distributed. For the work of Chinese micromorphologists, no review is available.

The interpretation of micromorphological features has been based essentially on comparison between thin section observations, macromorphological features and laboratory data. The most probable hypothesis is then accepted, and in many cases gradually considered as a proven fact. Interpretation is also often based on the authority of an author, as it is anyway also the case in many other scientific disciplines. Especially in the early days of micromorphology, the opinion of Kubiëna was often taken for granted, although it generally lacked supporting laboratory analyses results.

In several cases the genesis of specific features or fabrics remains controversial, such as the origin of the small rounded aggregates in Oxisols (see Marcelino et al., 2010, 2018), Andosols (see Sedov et al., 2010; Stoops et al., 2018) and spodic horizons (see Wilson & Righi, 2010; Van Ranst et al., 2018).

Interpretation can also be based on experimental work in the laboratory or in the field (see Section 7), or on field observations. A good example of the latter is the correlation between determinations of hydromorphic conditions in the field and the resulting micromorphological features (Veneman et al., 1976).

Regolith genesis as a result of weathering has been studied in thin sections by petrographers since the first part of the 20th century (e.g., Harrison, 1933). In the 1950s, pedologists also began using this technique to study weathering, saprolite formation and pedoplasmation, especially in Africa by ORSTOM (IRD) researchers (see also Stoops &

Schaefer, 2010, 2018; Zauyah et al., 2010, 2018). This resulted in numerous publications in journals and congress proceedings, besides a large number of unpublished reports and dissertations. Much of this material has been summarised in books by Nahon (1991), Tardy (1993) and especially Delvigne (1998).

# 3. Soil and Regolith Classification

In the genetic soil classification system of Kubiëna (1948, 1953), micromorphology was important to distinguish soil types such as Braunlehm and Terra Rossa or humus layers such as Mor and Anmoor. In modern soil classification systems only the one of FitzPatrick (2005) considers micromorphological features as important criteria for the identification of some horizons. In WRB (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015), micromorphological characteristics are used to a limited extent in the identification of horizons.

One difficulty in relating micromorphological data to classification criteria is that in most soil classification systems (e.g., WRB, Soil Taxonomy), diagnostic horizons or diagnostic materials are defined not only on a morphological basis but also on the basis of chemical or physical characteristics. Moreover, some horizons are defined not only by their own characteristics but also by differences with other parts of the same profile. Other horizons comprise a very broad and heterogeneous group of materials, such as the mollic and cambic horizons in Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 2014). Also, non-morphological properties, such as climate, often play a dominant role, keying out soils before their morphology is considered (e.g., Aridisols). It is worth mentioning that various international commissions on soil classification (e.g., ICOMAND, ICOMID, ICOMOX) intensively used micromorphology in their discussions, but these micromorphological data were never published in peer-reviewed journals.

In few cases, direct information on soil type is obtained from thin section observations. For example, the presence of fine clay coatings points to an argillic horizon, whereas other types of coatings may indicate natric or agric horizons. However, not all argillic horizons clearly show the occurrence of clay illuviation in thin sections (e.g., most Red Mediterranean soils), and not all clay illuviation features are the result of vertical transport from an E horizon to a Bt horizon (see Kuhn et al., 2010, 2018). Similar considerations are possible for other horizons such as the gypsum (see Poch et al., 2010, 2018) and calcic (see Durand et al., 2010, 2018). Other horizons, such as the oxic, display a characteristic combination of clearly recognisable micromorphological features (see Marcelino et al., 2010, 2018), but not all materials with these characteristics key out as oxic. On the other hand, some features observed in thin sections are not directly related to specific diagnostic horizons, such as features related to gley phenomena (see Lindbo et al., 2010; Vepraskas et al., 2018), stress movements, bioturbation or eluviation, but they may be important for soil classification at other levels (e.g., moisture regime, vertic and vermic characteristics).

For some diagnostic horizons practically no published micromorphological data are available, as is the case for the sombric horizon, although a micromorphological identification criterion is included in the description of this horizon in Soil Taxonomy.

Several materials, considered as parent materials in Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 2014) and WRB (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015), are considered as part of the regolith profile by other authors with a more naturalistic and holistic approach, especially in the tropics where deep regoliths are common.

For regolith materials, no internationally accepted classification system exists. The proposal of Buol (1994) for saprolites and regoliths, although based on reflections of an international working group, is hardly used, and the system does not contain micromorphological criteria. The latter is also the case for the nomenclature system that was more recently proposed by Juilleret et al. (2016). Also for the subdivision of individual regolith types, such as laterites, tephra and colluvial sediments, no micromorphological criteria were used.

# 4. Palaeopedology, Quaternary Geology and Archaeology

Climatic changes during the Quaternary, characterised by an alternation of colder and warmer periods, have been recorded by fabric changes in soils or sediments. Micromorphological methods have been applied, especially in the study of soils from Eurasia and North America, to observe imprints of former cold periods, such as freeze-thaw features (see Van Vliet-Lanoë, 2010; Van Vliet-Lanoë & Fox, 2018). Micromorphological studies of glacial sediments started already in the 1960s (Korina & Faustova, 1964). Later, they have been promoted mainly by van der Meer and Menzies (e.g., van der Meer, 1987, 1993, 1996; Menzies, 1998; Menzies et al., 2010; van der Meer & Menzies, 2011) and soon became a discipline on its own. Changes in climate and vegetation also resulted in formation of surface sediments, such as colluvium and solifluction layers that were studied with micromorphological techniques (see also Mücher et al., 2010, 2018).

In arid and semiarid areas, climate changes are mainly recorded in the fabric and composition of calcareous (see Durand et al., 2010, 2018) and gypsic (see Poch et al., 2010, 2018) horizons, or deposits of soluble salts (see Mees & Tursina, 2010, 2018). Their micromorphological study contributed definitely to the understanding of past climate and environmental change.

The use of micromorphology to disentangle the complex fabric of palaeosols was already mentioned by Kubiëna (1956). It is evident that interpretation of micromorphological features of palaeosols is only possible based on a thorough knowledge and understanding of the characteristics of present-day soils. This is complicated by the fact that few soils are the result of a single pedogenic cycle, which implies that most frequently several cycles have to be considered (see Fedoroff et al., 2010, 2018; Cremaschi et al., 2018). Early micromorphological research on fossil (buried) soils was

published, for instance, by Morozova (1964), Smolikova (1967, 1978), Ferrari and Magaldi (1968), Dalrymple (1972) and Bullock and Murphy (1979) (see also Mücher & Morozova, 1983). Especially in the field of loess stratigraphy a huge amount of micromorphological research has been done (e.g., Smolikova, 1958, 1967, 1972, 1978; Bronger, 1969/1970, 1972; Kemp & Derbyshire, 1998; Kemp, 1999, 2001). The amount of micromorphological data on pre-Quaternary soils is still limited, and practically no information is available on diagenetic features developed after burial.

Today, it is difficult to imagine geoarchaeology without micromorphology. Although the use of micromorphological techniques in archaeology dates already from the 1950s (e.g., Cornwall, 1958), only after the late 1980s have archaeologists become a very active group in micromorphology (see Courty et al., 1989; Davidson et al., 1992; Stoops, 2014; see also Nicosia & Stoops, 2017). Archaeologists apply micromorphology mainly in two fields:

- The study of soils and related materials, such as those resulting from forest clearing, ancient cultivation methods or compaction through trampling by domesticated animals, as well as buried soils, infills and earthy structures (see Adderley et al., 2010, 2018); this type of research is closely related to the study of natural soils, and existing micromorphological concepts and terms are adequate for the description of these materials.  
- The interpretation of archaeological layers and the identification of archaeological materials, such as excrements, mortars, burned materials, ashes and metal slag (see Karkanas & Goldberg, 2010, 2018; Macphail & Goldberg, 2010, 2018); here special features and materials are encountered, not completely covered by the standard micromorphological concepts.

# 5. Soil Management and Other Applications

The contributions of micromorphology in the field of soil and land management are mainly indirect. By providing a better understanding of processes in the soil, micromorphology helps improving or choosing good management practices. Most direct applications are based on quantitative studies of porosity. They often deal with compaction by heavy equipment or trampling. Monitoring seal and crust formation by micromorphological methods has been successful (see Pagliai & Stoops, 2010; Williams et al., 2018). Other examples of qualitative research are studies of changes in structure (Borchert, 1961, 1964, 1972), root penetration (Stewart et al., 1994), silting of drainage systems (Houot & Berthelin, 1987; Herrero Isern et al., 1989) and slurry application (Sveistrup et al., 1995).

Forensic studies using micromorphological techniques are still rare, mainly because their confidential nature generally does not permit publication. However, micromor-. phology can become an important tool for this science, once the results of this type of investigation become more accessible, as for instance for detecting clandestine graves (Goldberg & Macphail, 2006).

# 6. Correlations Between Micromorphology and Physical Data

Relatively few efforts have been made to correlate quantitative or semiquantitative micromorphological data with data of chemical or physical measurements. Most work has been done on the comparison between porosity measurements in thin sections and soil physical porosity data. These studies include the pioneering works of Jongerius (Jongerius et al., 1972; Jongerius, 1974), and later those of Bouma et al. (1979), comparing saturated flow in clayey soils with micromorphometric data, and also various studies by Pagliai on soil structure changes (see Pagliai, 2008). With respect to soil structure, qualitative correlations have since long been made between transformations of porosity patterns and management techniques (e.g., Borchert, 1964, 1972).

The second-most quantified type of features are clay coatings/infillings and their fragments, which can be correlated with relative clay contents determined by textural analyses (e.g., Grossman, 1964; Miedema & Slager, 1972; see also Kuhn et al., 2010, 2018). For this application, Murphy and Kemp (1984) presented nomograms to help correlating the volumetric and weight increase of fine clay. Efforts have also been made to correlate b-fabrics with plasticity and the amount of easily dispersible clay in oxic materials (Embrechts & Stoops, 1986; Zainol & Stoops, 1986; see also Stoops & Mees, 2018) and in Vertisols (see Kovda & Mermut, 2010, 2018).

Good correlations between micromorphological and physical data may become important in future, to link micropedology with applied soil science, employing methods used in pedometrics. This will require, however, a standardisation of methods and parameters used by different laboratories to obtain results that can be compared, as results depend strongly on methodology (e.g., Marcelino et al., 2007).

# 7. Monitoring Experimental Work and Analyses

Micromorphology is a powerful tool to monitor experimental studies aimed at simulating and understanding processes of soil and regolith genesis. The fact that small changes may become visible in thin sections before they can be detected by physical or chemical analyses makes it a valuable method. However, no systematic research has been done yet in this field and relative few data have been published. Experimental studies were done for instance on the development of striated b-fabrics by shearing (Morgenstern & Tchalenko, 1967; Jim, 1990; see also Stoops & Mees, 2018), freeze-thaw features (Frese & Czeratzki, 1957; Coutard & Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1994), colluvial sedimentation (Mücher & De Ploey, 1977, 1984, 1990), faunal activity (Jeanson, 1964; Bal, 1977; Eschenbrenner, 1987), formation of clay coatings (Brewer & Haldane, 1957;

Dalrymple, 1972; Theocharopoulos & Dalrymple, 1987), pyrite formation (Rabenhorst, 1990) and aggregate stability (Breuer, 1997). Experimental work has been exceptionally important for the study of the formation of surface seals and crusts, which is largely based on combined field and laboratory experiments (see Pagliai & Stoops, 2010; Williams et al., 2018).

The precipitation and crystallisation of carbonates, gypsum and highly soluble salts have commonly been studied in thin sections or with the stereomicroscope. Early examples are studies of calcite precipitation by Wells (1965) and Aguilar et al. (1978). Many laboratory experiments have been done for gypsum crystallisation to understand the significance of its various crystal habits (see Poch et al., 2010, 2018).

In archaeology, efforts have been made to support interpretations by comparing micromorphological features for excavated and experimental materials (e.g., Mathieu & Stoops, 1972; Canti, 2003; see also Macphail & Goldberg, 2010, 2018; Nicosia & Stoops, 2017).

The role of micromorphology in checking and monitoring physical or chemical data is not sufficiently recognised and appreciated. Thin section analyses of undisturbed samples allow, for instance, an assessment of the results of grain-size analyses, by showing the presence of pseudosands (e.g., Pede & Langohr, 1983) or by revealing the real grain size of minerals that can become fragmented during laboratory treatments. Micromorphology is also one of the few techniques that allow lithogenic and pedogenic occurrences of a specific mineral, such as calcite or gypsum, to be distinguished, whereas chemical or mineralogical analyses only yield information on the presence and abundance of these constituents.

Thin section studies provide information on the composition of the fraction coarser than  $2\mathrm{mm}$ , which is commonly removed before soil analyses are performed (see also Stoops & Mees, 2018). This information is, for instance, important when pedochemical balance calculations are envisaged. For example, manganese and coprecipitated elements accumulated in nodules larger than  $2\mathrm{mm}$  will generally escape detection during routine analyses. Micromorphology can also help in avoiding errors in the interpretation of mineralogical data. For instance, in strongly weathered tropical soils, routine mineralogical analyses may show the presence of weatherable minerals, thus excluding an Oxisol classification for the profile. In several cases, thin sections show that these minerals are totally enclosed by iron oxides and thus no longer take part in soil processes (Baert & Van Ranst, 1997). Micromorphology has also been used to control the validity of various specific analyses of soil and regolith materials. An excellent example is that of palynology, where thin section studies can help to find out whether pollen grains are in situ or reworked (Van Mourik, 1999, 2003; Kooistra & Kooistra, 2003).

# 8. Evolutions in Analytical Methods

Concepts and terminology that are used in micromorphological studies seem at present to be rather stable, and no major changes have been proposed over the last years, but

considerable progress has been made in analytical techniques that can be applied to components in thin sections. In general, soil micromorphologists did not take much advantage of this progress, except in archaeological studies. FTIR-microscopy (or  $\mu$ -FTIR) was used, for instance, to analyse burned wood and bone (Berna & Goldberg, 2007; Berna et al., 2012), and organic remains in middens (Shillito, 2009). In studies of soil development, this methodology could be very useful for analysis of organic or amorphous phases, for instance, in spodic horizons, organic surface horizons or soils showing mineral weathering. Also other methods of thin section microanalysis, such as  $\mu$ -XRD,  $\mu$ -XRF and LA-IRMS, have been rarely used in soil micromorphology, except for archaeological soil materials (e.g., Bruneau et al., 2002; Berthold & Mentzer, 2017).

Although the methodology for obtaining powders by microdrilling in thin sections or corresponding impregnated blocks is known in micromorphology since several decades (van Oort et al., 1994; Denaix et al., 1999; Jongmans et al., 1999), it has only rarely been used. A recent example is its use in archaeology for stable isotope analysis (Mentzer & Quade, 2013; Mentzer, 2017).

Developments in imaging techniques to improve image quality for thin section documentation at the mesoscale have been recently reported (Carpentier & Vandermeulen, 2016).

The application of micro-CT scans in micromorphology was up to now mainly restricted to porosity studies (e.g., Elliot and Heck, 2007; Bendle et al., 2015) but could be a help to obtain 3D images of the distribution of some components.

# 9. Conclusions

The role of micromorphology in genetic studies and classification of soils and regoliths is clear, but up to now systematic and structured information on interpretation of micromorphological features is missing. This also applies for the study of palaeosols, as the same type of information is requested in this field. Much important micromorphological data that would be useful to extend the possibilities of interpretation exist but were never published in journals. Greater accessibility of this information, hidden in reports, excursion guides and dissertations, would therefore be important for the further progress of micromorphology.

Correlations between micromorphological data, both qualitative and quantitative, and chemical, physical, mineralogical and land use data are scarce. Relevant correlations could enhance the possibilities of using micromorphological analyses as a routine method, making it a tool in pedometrics.

# 1. Introduction

Slope deposits are sediments found on slopes or at the base or foot of slopes. Several processes are usually involved in the development of a given slope deposit, reflecting varying environmental conditions in time and space. Two main groups of formative processes can be distinguished: (i) slope wash, hill wash or rain wash, including soil erosion on agricultural land, and (ii) mass wasting.

The identification of various types of slope deposits is important in geomorphology, geology and palaeopedology. Slope deposits reflect the lithology but also the pedological history of the source area by the type of rock fragments and transported pedofeatures they contain. During geological prospection, they can provide valuable information on ore mineral sources.

Solifluction deposits and landslides (especially earth slides and earth flows) and debris-flow deposits (with high fine earth content) are related to the group of mass wasting processes. Other mass wasting deposits such as those produced by rock fall, (dry) grain flow and avalanching do not contain enough fine earth to allow a meaningful micromorphological study and will thus not be treated in this chapter.

In the absence of macroscopic indications, transported or displaced material on slopes can still be recognised by a number of micromorphological features. However, different slope processes may generate similar microfacies and it is therefore necessary to use macroscopic, microscopic and granulometric criteria for a reliable diagnosis of the studied sediments (Bertran & Texier, 1999). For instance, inverse graded bedding can occur in sieving crusts (see Valentin & Bresson, 1992) that are produced by intense rainfall on sandy soils along slopes (e.g., Puigdefabregas et al., 1999) and they may also be formed by kinematic sieving under dry conditions (e.g., Makse, 1999). Another example are vesicles, which can form in debris flows related to liquefaction (Bernard et al., 2009), but also in physical soil crusts as a result of air entrapment (e.g., Brown & Dunkerley, 1996; Bertran & Texier, 1999).

Moreover, post-depositional processes can deeply alter original microstructures, and thus severely complicate the analysis of slope deposits.

The micromorphology of slope deposits is a research theme that has received relatively little attention. Already in 1974 a plea was made for the study of the micromorphology of slope deposits (Mücher, 1974), which was repeated in 1983 (Mücher & Morozova, 1983). This did not generate much response at that time or later, as indicated by the review of the literature on the facies and microfacies of the main types of slope deposits by Bertran and Texier (1999). In recent years the interest for this subject remained limited. Among the ca. one hundred papers in the Proceedings of the 14th International Working Meeting on Soil Micromorphology (Poch et al., 2012), only one deals with the micromorphology of slope deposits (Trindade et al., 2012).

Macromorphological characteristics of various types of slope deposits are fairly well documented (e.g., Bertran et al., 1992, 1997; Hétu et al., 1995; van Steijn et al., 1995, 2002; Blikra & Nemec, 1998; Pawelec et al., 2015), whereas investigations on the associated micromorphological aspects are sparse and mainly concern solifluction deposits (e.g., Harris & Ellis, 1980; Harris, 1981; Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1985, 1987, 2010; Van Vliet-Lanoë & Fox, 2018).

Identification of colluvium and other sediments, in combination with knowledge of soil formation, is also important for understanding the geomorphic and palaeoenvironmental history of archaeological sites (Courty et al., 1989). Soil micromorphology is a reliable tool to characterise and distinguish between in situ soils, transported materials and materials affected by post-depositional processes, hence providing relevant information

for the reconstruction of the palaeoclimatic conditions (Courty et al., 1989; Bertran, 2005; Pustovoytov et al., 2011; see also Macphail & Goldberg, 2018).

The contribution of tillage erosion to the formation of colluvial deposits by water action has often been documented (e.g., Govers et al., 1994; van Oost et al., 2000; van Muijsen et al., 2002) but, as far as we know, no micromorphological criteria are available to discriminate water from tillage erosion deposits. Altogether, micromorphological observations were rarely used in investigations of colluvial deposits (Kwaad & Mücher, 1977, 1979; Bolt et al., 1980).

In the present chapter, the scarce literature on the micromorphology of slope deposits and associated processes is reviewed. Available micromorphological data mostly concerns colluvial deposits on loess (e.g., Mücher, 1974; Mücher & Morozova, 1983). Information on the micromorphology of colluvium originating from materials other than loess will be mostly based on Bertran and Texier (1999). Only one micromorphological study of colluvial wedges along faults appears to exist (Miedema & Jongmans, 2002). A related study presents thin section observations for palaeearthquake-related reworking of colluvium (Vanneste et al., 2008). Micromorphological data for most mass wasting deposits is also very limited. To date, the review of microfacies features of slope deposits by Bertran and Texier (1999) is the most comprehensive. In addition, Bertran (2004) gives a very extensive account on slope deposits with some micromorphological information for a limited number of depositional types.

Although focusing on cryogenic features, the work of Pawelec et al. (2015) covers a wider range of slope processes, environments and related deposits. These authors used micromorphological observations to identify sedimentary structures that could not be detected macroscopically in fine-grained sediments and in sediments transformed by soil processes. Examples of the use of thin sections for the study of a variety of sedimentary environments are also presented by van der Meer and Menzies (2011).

# 2. General Features of Translocated Material

The first question that arises when studying soil material on slopes is whether the material is in situ or translocated. A number of macroscopic features can be helpful in establishing the presence of translocated material on slopes such as layering, repetitions of the same sequence of soil horizons overlying each other, and stone lines. Another criterion in the case of landslides is an irregular topography (scarps, lobes, local depressions).

In the absence of these features, translocated or displaced material on slopes can still be recognised by the presence of certain micromorphological features lacking in the in situ material. Examples include fragments of pedofeatures (clay coatings, crusts), typic ferruginous nodules with sharp boundaries, horizontally oriented root fragments, rounded aggregates composed of material derived from other soil horizons, relicts of palaeosoil intervals, anthropogenic materials, sharply bounded and mostly (sub) rounded rock fragments, fresh rock fragments practically free of weathering rims and/or unknown in the area (Mücher, 1974; Kwaad & Müller, 1977). However, the presence of only one of the abovementioned features is often not enough to indicate translocation.

For example, fragments of clay coatings incorporated in the groundmass can also arise from biological activity and frost action.

# 3. Colluvial Deposits

The term colluvium is often used when discussing slope deposits, but no consensus exists on its definition (e.g., Kleber, 2006). It has been used as a synonym for (i) slope deposits, regardless of the mode of formation of the deposits (Hilgard, 1892; Selby, 1985; Soil Survey Staff, 1993; Bertran, 2004; Osterkamp, 2008; Pietsch & Machado, 2014), (ii) slope deposits formed by mass wasting processes, excluding slope wash (Merrill, 1897; Blikra & Nemec, 1998), (iii) slope deposits formed by slope wash (hill wash, rain wash) (Mücher, 1974; Mücher et al., 1981), and (iv) slope deposits formed by slope wash on agricultural land (Leopold & Völkel, 2007).

In this paper, colluvium is used in the sense of slope deposits formed by slope wash. It consists of transported material found on slopes, being particularly prominent at the slope foot. In loess regions it generally occurs on gentle slopes, less than 7 degrees. It commonly rests upon a soil horizon in situ (for example the Bt horizon of a truncated Alfisol profile) and shows an abrupt and smooth, sometimes wavy boundary with the horizon below (Mücher, 1974). In the field, two types of colluvium are recognised, laminated and non-laminated or massive. Laminated deposits mostly occur in valley bottoms and at the end of rills in alluvial fans.

Modern colluvial deposits derived from materials other than loess, from various regions, were studied by Bertran and Texier (1999). These deposits are generally moderately sorted, with marked spatial grain-size variation over short distances and randomly or weakly oriented coarse fragments. The deposits are typically composed of laminated bands, alternating with non-laminated intervals.

Compostella et al. (2014) detected several phases of palaeosoil development and deposition of colluvium in the treeline zone in the Northern Apennines, Italy. Multiple colluvial layers containing material of different origins could be identified as part of dismantled soils using micromorphological evidence.

# 3.1 Laminated Colluvium

Laminated colluvium commonly reflects alternating processes of in situ structural soil crust formation and sedimentation of detached soil material, including crust fragments, due to raindrop impact and overland flow (see Pagliai & Stoops, 2010 and Williams et al., 2018).

In loess, laminated colluvium is composed of individual layers predominantly  $1 - 2\mathrm{mm}$  thick, homogeneous in composition and more or less parallel to the soil surface. Field observations revealed that these deposits are formed during heavy rainstorms when rill erosion occurred on fallow arable land, or on arable land only partly covered by crops like maize in an early stage, which fail to protect the soil from rain splash impact (Mücher, 1974).

In thin sections, the alternating layers (Figs. 1 and 2) are composed of individual laminae with different size distributions of mineral grains and rounded aggregates and with different degrees of sorting (Mücher et al., 1981). The rounded aggregates result from disruption by running water of subsoil horizons, mostly Bt horizons, and are rather stable during transport in water. The layers contain few voids, mainly simple and compound packing voids and occasionally vesicles, which usually show a referred orientation pattern parallel to the soil surface.

Laboratory experiments on loess with the aim of studying the mode of redeposition of silt loam have shown that turbulent rainwash generally leads to the formation of poorly layered colluvial deposits with poorly sorted individual laminae (some containing rounded clods smaller than  $3\mathrm{mm}$ ); the ratio between the percentage by volume of laminae composed of grains between 10 and  $50~{\mu\mathrm{m}}$  and the percentage by volume of those composed of grains smaller than  $30~{\mu\mathrm{m}}$  is larger than one (Mücher & De Ploey, 1977; Mücher et al., 1981). Under conditions of flow without splash, for instance simulating afterflow that occurs for a short period after rainfall has ceased or meltwater flow, the finer fractions are preferentially deposited and the ratio mentioned above is equal to or smaller than one. These deposits are loosely packed, well layered with individual laminae displaying excellent sorting and mineral differentiation (Mücher et al., 1981; Mücher & Morozova, 1983).

Laminated parts in colluvial deposits, originating from materials other than loess, appear in thin sections as formed by juxtaposed mineral grains and rounded to subangular peds, the relative amount of the latter depending on aggregate stability of the original material (Bertran & Texier, 1999). According to these authors, the laminated and sorted parts in colluvial sediments represent areas of rapid vertical or lateral particle accumulation, which can be extensive (e.g., downslope of large gullies). The c/f-related distribution pattern ranges from monic or enaulic to chitonic-gefuric, the latter corresponding to periods of slow water flow, which resulted in impregnations by fine material. Laminated intervals alternate with massive, poorly sorted deposits with chitonic to single-spaced porphyric c/f-related distribution pattern. These massive zones correspond either to former structural crusts (Valentin & Bresson, 1992), to deposits formed by overland flow in combination with splash (Mücher & De Ploey, 1977; cf. frequent scattered flakes of silt laminae), or to hyperconcentrated flow deposits.

Overland flow giving rise to colluvial deposits derived from the erosion of clayey soils are composed predominantly of clayey aggregates (Alberts et al., 1980). Colluvium can also be almost exclusively formed by mesofauna excrements, if derived from humic soils (Mücher et al., 1972).

# 3.2 Non-laminated Colluvium

In the field, non-laminated loess-derived colluvial sediments have a silty loam texture, are mainly massive but sometimes have a weakly developed angular blocky structure, with medium and fine pores.

In thin sections, the groundmass is mainly composed of silt-sized mineral grains and small amounts of clay (Fig. 3). Pedofeatures, such as anorthic iron oxide nodules, fragments of clay coatings from the Bt horizon, fragments of chert and other rock types not occurring in the area, coal and brick fragments are also often present (Mücher, 1974).

Laboratory experiments and microscopic observations on loess materials (Mücher & De Ploey, 1977; Mücher et al., 1981) revealed that non-laminated deposits are produced by splash, i.e., raindrop impact leading to displacement of material. In thin sections, these deposits show no lamination, no sorting and practically no mineral differentiation.

Field experiments showed that niveo-eolian deposits are not laminated (Dijkmans & Mücher, 1989).

# 3.3 Post-depositional Alterations

The main modification of colluvial deposits after deposition is soil formation.

Bolt et al. (1980) recognised four types of illuvial clay coatings micromorphologically: type 1 - (dirty) dark brown, speckled coatings of clay with weak continuous orientation;

type 2 - (dirty) brown, speckled, impure clay coatings, with weak striated to weak strial b-fabric (matriargillans; Van Schuylenborgh et al., 1970) or coatings consisting of clay, silt and organic matter (agricutans; Jongerius, 1970); type 3 - compound clay coatings consisting of a combination of types 1 and 2; type 4 - yellow to yellowish brown, limpid clay coatings with a strong parallel orientation. These four types of clay coatings probably reflect increasing soil formation with increasing age of the deposit (see also Kuhn et al., 2010, 2018). With time, the layered colluvia can be partly destroyed by tillage. However, small crust fragments are still recognisable under the microscope.

Miedema and Jongmans (2002) observed, in a colluvial wedge in Late Weichselian colluvial deposits, large greyish areas in which former coatings of strongly oriented clay show a decreased orientation of the clay and a greyish appearance, which they explained as a result of the so-called ferrolysis (see also Kuhn et al., 2010, 2018). Such grey coatings also occurred around the outer edges of large fragments of the Bt horizon in the colluvial infilling of the wedge.

# 4. Mass Wasting Deposits

Micromorphological information was mainly found for solifluction, certain types of landslides (earth-slide and earth-flow deposits) and debris flows. In the field, mass wasting deposits may show crude or clear stratification, whereas traces of stratification may be completely absent in part of the sediments. Most of these deposits show a diamictic character. Some are accumulations of loosely stacked clasts, often with openwork arrangement.

# 4.1 Solifluction Deposits

Solifluction, the slow downslope flowing of saturated slope material, is generally related to periglacial environments (cf. French, 1996) but can be found in non-periglacial landscapes as well. It usually results from the combination of two mechanisms, namely frost creep and gelifluction (e.g., Van Vliet-Lanoë et al., 1984; Harris, 1987).

Solifluction deposits generally occur as lobes or sheets with fairly well-defined limits on slopes of a wide variety of steepness classes. Solifluction deposits are characterised by a well-developed preferred clast orientation perpendicular to contours (Brochu, 1978; Nelson, 1985; Bertran et al., 1997; Bertran & Texier, 1999) and by the presence of a platy structure with deformed features like folds or downslope overturned strata (Benedict, 1970; Van Vliet-Lanoë & Valadas, 1983; van Steijn et al., 1995). However, platy structures can develop also in other environments.

Microfabrics related to soli(geli)fluction are generally characterised by a preferred oblique orientation of elongated grains and rotated silt cappings (e.g., Huijzer, 1993).

Micromorphological features characteristic of periglacial solifluction deposits are further discussed by Van Vliet-Lanoë (2010) and Van Vliet-Lanoë & Fox (2018).

# 4.2 Landslides

Landslides are mass displacements along a basal shear plane when shear forces working along the slope overcome the resistance of the material. In many cases there are several internal slip planes above this basal shear plane. The moving mass may become brittle or ductile, depending on the material properties before and after failure, and this eventually determines to a certain degree the sedimentary properties of the deposit. (Ground)water plays an important role, both by inducing failure of the material and by affecting its behaviour after initial motion and at the end of the movement.

All kinds of combination of slabs and blocks, and coarse and fine fractions may be present in landslide deposits. However, a micromorphological characterisation is only relevant for earth-slide and earth-flow deposits, which have a relatively large mineral fraction  $< 2\mathrm{mm}$ .

Micromorphological characterisation of subaqueous sliding and subglacial sediment deformation is not in the scope of this chapter (see van der Meer, 1993, 1996; van der Meer et al., 1993, 2003; Hiemstra et al., 2004).

Bertran and Texier (1999) studied the micromorphological characteristics of clay-rich landslides. Earth slide deposits typically show a heterogeneous material characterised by fragments of sedimentary material (sedimentary clasts) incorporated in a dense groundmass (brecciated fabric) with an open porphyric c/f-related distribution pattern and a great variety of deformation features. Areas with angular to subrounded sediment aggregates are juxtaposed to areas with deformed, boudinaged (elongated in one direction and having the shape of a sausage in cross section) and stretched clay lumps. The b-fabric ranges from undifferentiated to crystallitic depending on the composition of the material. Striated b-fabrics corresponding to shearing bands are locally observed. A brecciated fabric is characteristic of earth slides where deformation is weak (see Fig. 4).

The initial stages of deformation are usually marked by the occurrence of features due to rotation of rigid inclusions such as tails around gravels (galaxy or turbate fabrics) (e.g., van der Meer, 1997; Bertran & Texier, 1999). Individual slip planes in clay-rich sediments (see Fig. 5) are characterised in thin sections by a mono- or parallel striated b-fabric (Fabre et al., 2004).

Jaeger et al. (2014) and Jaeger and Menzies (2015) compared micromorphological features of crown, middle part and toe of landslides near Würzburg in Germany and observed systematic differences between those segments, discussed in terms of landslide development processes.

# 4.3 Debris-Flow Deposits

Debris flows, i.e., rapid mass movements of poorly sorted granular solids, water and air, leave elongated, narrow tracks of very heterogeneous material. Generally, levees occur along the track, which ultimately join to form a terminal lobe. Lenses of openwork, loose mineral and rock fragments (clasts) may alternate with fine earth-rich material, the latter either in clast-supported or matrix-supported arrangement. This applies to both parts of the debris-flow deposits. Sedimentary properties are discussed by

van Steijn et al. (1995) and Bertran et al. (1997). Bertran and Texier (1999) describe some micromorphological features found in groundmass-rich, 'cohesive' debris-flow deposits. In particular, a homogeneous fine-grained groundmass, a porphyric c/f-related distribution pattern and an undifferentiated or crystallitic b-fabric are mentioned to be typical, and the occasional presence of intact to deformed vesicles has also been reported.

Lachniet et al. (2001) compared microstructures of non-glacial sediment-flow deposits and subglacial sediments, describing several comparable elements like folds, pressure shadows and reorientation of clasts around a 'core' stone, due to ductile deformation, or shears, faults and brecciation, caused by brittle deformation. Other features in common are fluid escape and injection structures, clast haloes and fissility. Also, Menzies and Zaniewski (2003) compared the micromorphological characteristics of a fresh debris-flow deposit with the poorly sorted Quaternary glacial deposits from which it derived and concluded they were both very similar. The most important difference between both deposits is the presence of 'tiled' structures produced by the downslope flow deceleration and dewatering resulting in transverse bands of clays developing in rhythmiclike patterns. 'Marbled' structures showing complex intercalations of differing matrix sediments, caused by intense deformation were also not found in the in situ Quaternary diamicton. In a beautifully illustrated paper, Phillips (2006) described micromorphological features near the base of a Pleistocene debris flow in central Scotland. The features observed include 'turbate' and 'galaxy' fabrics together with specific b-fabrics (often granostriated), several types of folds and faults, and hydrofractures. The phenomena found are interpreted as showing evidence of basal shearing, hydrofracturing, liquefaction and rotational deformation during the emplacement of the deposits. According to this author, the micromorphological features observed, such as galaxy and turbate structures, are comparable to those found in subglacial diamictons and thus not diagnostic by themselves.

More recently, Pleskot (2015) analyzed micromorphological features of moraine-derived debris-flow lobes on Svalbard to reconstruct flow properties that were not detected macroscopically.

# 4.4 Grain-Flow Deposits

(Dry) grain-flow deposits (cf. van Steijn et al., 1995) generally occur on steep taluses and consist mostly of loose, very poorly sorted angular aggregates. Near the bottom of the deposit, a fine-grained (fine sand to silt) interval is often found, indicating the slip plane along which the flow moved down. Bertran and Texier (1999) describe micromorphological features of such a slip plane found in Pleistocene talus deposits. The 'sole layers', as the slip-plane deposits are called by the authors, are characterised by 'scattered sand grains within a homogeneous fine matrix (open porphyric c/f-related distribution pattern) with a crystallitic b-fabric (randomly distributed small crystals of calcite)'. The layers involved were slightly indurated by secondary carbonates.

# 5. Conclusions

Micromorphological studies can play an important role in the recognition of transported materials and the identification of their mode of redeposition. However, still too little is known about the micromorphological characteristics of slope deposits. For mass wasting, micromorphological data are very limited and mainly regards solifluction deposits, earth slides and earth flows. For colluvial deposits, information is mainly available for laminated and non-laminated colluvium derived from loess. Another field where micromorphology could be a relevant tool is the role of tillage erosion, which has been related to the development of colluvial deposits in field experiments. A combination of field and laboratory research, including thin section studies, would contribute to a better understanding and knowledge of slope processes.

# 1. Introduction

Saprolite is isovolumetrically weathered bedrock that retains the original lithic fabric (Stolt & Baker, 1994). Most tropical landscapes are underlain by these weathered mantles

of varying thickness. The saprolite usually reaches down to more than  $50\mathrm{m}$  in humid areas on crystalline rocks, where they form an important part of the regolith. Due to long-term weathering under stable tropical conditions, most present-day humid tropical soils developed from deeply weathered saprolites rather than from the parent rock, and their physical and chemical properties are related to the nature of the saprolite. Hence, saprolites should be treated as parent materials of the majority of soils in the tropics and subtropics, especially those in acid igneous and metamorphic rock provinces (Stoops, 1989). In Europe and North America, most of the thick saprolite covers have during the Quaternary glaciations been removed by erosion (e.g., by rivers or glaciers) or covered (e.g., by loess). In these continents, present-day weathering rates are also far slower than the rate of pedoplasmation so that in general no saprolite mantle is formed.

Micromorphological and submicroscopic techniques have been used in the study of saprolites developed on various rock types, both in tropical and subtropical regions (Stoops, 1967; Fölster, 1971; Eswaran & Wong Chaw Bin, 1978; Santos et al., 1989; Zauyah & Stoops, 1990; Scholten et al., 1997; Schaefer et al., 2002) and in temperate and Mediterranean areas (Scarciglia et al., 2005; Jiménez-Espinosa et al., 2007). However, the number of micromorphological studies on saprolites is limited and in many cases they focus much more on mineral weathering than on fabric changes.

The aim of this chapter is to give information on micromorphological aspects of saprolite formation, illustrating especially changes in fabric and in the weathering sequence of minerals. For more detailed information on weathering of individual minerals, the reader is referred to excellent specialised volumes, such as those by Nahon (1991), Tardy (1993) and Delvigne (1998) (see also Stoops & Mees, 2018). The basic micromorphological terminology used here is that of Stoops (2003).

# 2. The Saprolite Profile

Most weathering profiles include a basal interval of compact altered rock, termed 'saprock' (Zauyah, 1986; Tonui et al., 2003), which is a term adopted from Meunier et al. (1983), and mostly corresponds to the so-called lower saprolite. The upper saprolite is less compact and, toward the surface, it gradually loses its original lithic fabric to form soil material, a process named pedoplasmaton (see Stoops & Schaefer, 2010, 2018). Exceptionally, the lithic fabric is preserved by deposition of Al and Fe oxides in profiles where the saprolite is transformed directly to bauxitic or lateritic materials ('isoalterite').

Saprolites are long-term products of chemical weathering, which may be older than  $20\mathrm{Ma}$  in most tropical areas, reaching depths exceeding  $150\mathrm{m}$  in some places (Thomas, 1994). The formation of deep saprolites requires tectonic stability, as the rate of chemical weathering and downward progress of the weathering front must exceed the rate of erosion (Butt et al., 1997). The relief of the area should also allow sufficient leaching of the weathering products to occur. Deep saprolites have been observed not only in tropical regions but also in humid temperate regions, where they are generally

considered to be palaeofeatures. When studying saprolites, one should be aware of the considerable three-dimensional variability of their nature, and the difficulties that arise from sampling materials at great depths, commonly exceeding  $20\mathrm{m}$ .

In general, the type of bedrock influences the nature of the saprolite. Saprolites are commonly deep on quartz-rich lithologies such as granite, granitic gneiss, schists and sandstones, but they are shallow to nonexistent on quartz-free calcareous, basaltic and mafic lithologies.

# 3. General Micromorphological Features

The micromorphological features of saprolite profiles are the result of weathering of the primary minerals, and of processes such as biological activity, illuviation and neoformation, including the accumulation of iron oxides and neoformed clays in voids. The resulting features are highly variable, both vertically and horizontally, as a result of differences in fabric and mineralogical composition of the parent rock, degree of weathering and hydrological conditions (Scholten et al., 1997), which can be further complicated by hydrothermal alteration that occurred before saprolite development (Evans & Bothner, 1993). Most descriptions of rock weathering and saprolites deal with mineral transformations, especially in rocks composed of large crystals of feldspar, mica, hornblende and quartz (e.g., Gilkes & Suddhiprakarn, 1979; Calvert et al., 1980; Rebertus et al., 1986; Buol & Weed, 1991; Robertson & Eggleton, 1991; Wilson, 2004). Pedofeatures often observed in tropical saprolites include clay coatings and infillings, Fe oxide coatings, hypocoatings and impregnative nodules, as well as excrement infillings. In arid areas, infillings composed of calcite and/or soluble salts (gypsum, thenardite, halite) may develop, which contributes to the physical weathering of rocks and minerals, a process called 'plasmasprengung' (Kerpen et al., 1960).

The fabric of the saprolite is related to the original lithic fabric, which is most obvious in the lower saprolite (Fig. 1). As the primary minerals weather, voids develop and secondary minerals are formed, which can cause the breakup of the lithic fabric in the upper saprolite (see also Stoops & Schaefer, 2010, 2018). Saprolites on gneiss, schists and phyllites may preserve the original schistosity.

Voids are common features in saprolites. They may be inherited from the rock, in which they can be formed by mechanical or thermal stress, partly controlled by the bedding or schistosity. Inter-, intra- and transmineral voids generally have a different genesis. These voids may increase in number and/or in size with increasing degree of weathering and can be filled with weathering products. The voids constitute the primary path for weathering solutions into the rock (Meunier, 1983). Void patterns have been suggested to be responsible for spheroidal weathering patterns (Bisdom, 1967a; Buss et al., 2008).

Mechanical fracturing in the saprolite may affect quartz grains (Curmi & Maurice, 1981; Zauyah, 1986). These fractures may become filled with illuvial clay (Fig. 2), derived

from local weathering of biotite or feldspar grains (Chartres & Walker, 1987). Quartz is also affected by chemical weathering, as revealed by a surface morphology characterised by etch pits of varying size and density in SEM images (Eswaran & Stoops, 1979; Marcelino et al., 1999; Schulz & White, 1999).

Weathering products may be different depending on the climate at the time of weathering or exposure of the rock. For instance, weathering of feldspar in tropical saprolites results in in situ replacement by 1:1 clay minerals (halloysite and kaolinite) or in dissolution, whereas 2:1 phyllosilicates form in less humid conditions. Biotite is usually weathered to vermiculite and mixed layer clays in dry climates, whereas kaolinite booklets stained with iron oxides are typical alteromorphs under wetter conditions (Bisdom et al., 1982) (Fig. 2). Garnet shows only partial dissolution in dry climates, in

contrast to almost complete transformation to iron oxides under wetter conditions (Embrechts & Stoops, 1982; Simas et al., 2005).

Weathering of pyroxenes in a Mediterranean climate (central Italy) shows iron oxides lining cleavage planes and fractures, as well as bleaching of the edges of crystals, as signs of early alteration (Certini et al., 2006). In humid tropical regions, weathering of pyroxenes proceeds from cracks that become coated by goethite, evolving to a boxwork structure by congruent dissolution of the mineral residues (Mulyanto et al., 1999). In drier climates, olivine and pyroxenes can be transformed to alteromorphs composed of expandable 2:1 clays and iron oxides of varying crystallinity (Chesworth et al., 2004), whereas in wetter climates (tropical to subtropical), kaolinite and iron oxides are formed (Delvigne et al., 1979).

Amphiboles (actinolite) in a Mediterranean climate show progressive replacement by a yellow brown trioctahedral vermiculite along fractures and cleavage cracks (Abreu & Vairinho, 1990). In the tropics, however, amphiboles first undergo alteration along cleavage planes which become filled with smectite (Verheye & Stoops, 1975) or iron oxides (Zauyah & Stoops, 1990), forming a boxwork structure by congruent dissolution of the remaining amphibole fragments. SEM images show that dissolution causes pronounced etching along cleavage planes, which commonly exhibit a dented appearance (Anand & Gilkes, 1984).

# 4. Saprolites on Specific Lithological Rock Types

# 4.1 Igneous Rocks

# 4.1.1 Granite

The main components of granite are quartz, alkali feldspar, plagioclase, biotite and muscovite, forming a rock with a granular or porphyric lithic fabric. The fabric of the saprolite has been described as rock-controlled (Stolt et al., 1991; Frazier & Graham, 2000), meaning that the distribution and orientation of mineral grains and void spaces is controlled by the structural and textural properties of the parent rock. In the lower saprolite, the microfabric may show inter-, intra- and transmineral planar voids resulting from mechanical weathering (Espino & Paneque, 1974; Chartres & Walker, 1987; Poetsch, 1990; Scarciglia et al., 2005), such as fractures in quartz and plagioclase grains, which can be filled by amorphous clay or sesquioxides (Fig. 2) (Rutherford, 1987; Evans & Bothner, 1993). In the upper saprolite, the fractures may break the crystals into smaller angular fragments.

A decreasing stability sequence, such as quartz  $>$  muscovite  $>$  alkali feldspar  $>$  biotite  $>$  plagioclase, is observed in various climatic regions, with varying types of weathering products (Espino & Paneque, 1974; Verheye & Stoops, 1975; Eswaran & Wong Chaw Bin, 1978; Gilkes et al., 1980; Curmi & Maurice, 1981; Melfi et al., 1983; Poetsch, 1990; Taboada & Garcia, 1999a, 1999b; Frazier & Graham, 2000; Le Pera & Sorriso-Valvo, 2000; Sequeira Braga et al., 2002; Jiménez-Espinosa et al., 2007).

Pseudomorphic or alteromorphic weathering of plagioclases usually begins in the saprock, where they obtain a speckled appearance caused by inclusions of newly formed minerals. Some of these minerals (e.g., epidote, chlorite and sericite) can be the result of hydrothermal alteration rather than weathering. In the tropics, commonly reported weathering products are kaolinite, halloysite and gibbsite (Eswaran & Wong Chaw Bin, 1978; Gilkes et al., 1980). In temperate climates, illite, vermiculite and chlorite are observed (Sequeira Braga et al., 2002), although gibbsite has been reported as well (Bisdom, 1967b; Taboada & Garcia, 1999a). Perthite and plagioclase are commonly sericitised, especially near the grain centres, which is believed to be due to hydrothermal alteration (Evans & Bothner, 1993). In a Mediterranean climate, feldspar is transformed to kaolinite and illite in densely jointed rocks and to interstratified illite/smectite in less fractured rock (Jiménez-Espinosa et al., 2007). Stoops and Dedecker (2006) report the formation of clay minerals oriented perpendicular to the walls of fissures in plagioclase in the saprock. Gibbsite alteromorphs after plagioclase have commonly been reported for saprolites of the subtropics (Felix-Henningsen et al., 1989) and the tropics (Delvigne, 1965; Delvigne & Martin, 1970). The most common weathering product of alkali feldspar is kaolinite, in various climatic conditions (Melfi et al., 1983).

The alteration of biotite is expressed by a loss of pleochroism and a decrease of interference colours (Fig. 2), indicating transformation to interstratified biotite-vermiculite and iron oxides along cleavage planes or crystal edges (Taboada & Garcia, 1999b). Further weathering to kaolinite often results in exfoliation of the biotite grains (Verheye & Stoops, 1975; Curmi & Maurice, 1981; Bisdom et al., 1982). In semiarid regions of Brazil, mica breakdown is associated with smectite formation, whereas in more humid regions, interlayered mica-vermiculite, vermiculite and kaolinite are formed (Melfi et al., 1983). The subsequent pseudomorphic transformation of biotite to chlorite, smectite and ultimately to kaolinite was observed by Stoops and Dedecker (2006).

Muscovite shows a decrease in birefringence during weathering, resulting in grey yellow interference colours toward the edges while the centre remains unchanged. Exfoliation features, although much less common than in biotite, are usually observed in the upper saprolite (Curmi & Maurice, 1981; Rutherford, 1987). Dark brown and black stains are observed along some crystal edges.

Amphiboles in a tropical saprolite first form a fragile boxwork of smectitic clays (Stoops, 2003), and the amphibole remnants gradually disappear by congruent dissolution (Verheye & Stoops, 1975).

Large quartz grains often show fractures that may have infillings of clay, iron oxides or gibbsite, forming a feature termed runiquartz (Espino & Paneque, 1974; Eswaran et al., 1975; Eswaran & Wong Chaw Bin, 1978; Frazier & Graham, 2000). Various types of fracture patterns in weathered granitic rocks were described by Power et al. (1990).

Common pedofeatures observed for granitic saprolites are complete or incomplete infillings of oriented yellowish or reddish brown clay in intra- and transmineral voids (Espino & Paneque, 1974; Chartres & Walker, 1987; Rutherford, 1987; Felix-Henningsen

et al., 1989). Ferruginous coatings of fissures are also common (Ismail, 1981). For the upper saprolite, impregnative iron oxide nodules and chalcedony nodules were reported by Stoops and Dedecker (2006).

# 4.1.2 Diorite

Weathering of dioritic rocks has been studied by several authors (Sousa & Eswaran, 1975; Eswaran et al., 1977; Ismail, 1981; Scholten et al., 1997; Thomas et al., 1999; Buss et al., 2008). In the reduction zone of the lower saprolite, dominated by smectite, green amphiboles show distinct pleochroism. In the middle saprolite, iron oxide coatings cover the mineral remnants and smectite is present as an intermediate phase. In the upper (kaolinitic) saprolite, the amphiboles have been completely dissolved and iron oxide pseudomorphs with a boxwork fabric remain (Scholten et al., 1997).

Biotite grains in a granodioritic saprolite show alteromorphic alteration to kaolinite and goethite, the latter occurring as framboids on crystal surfaces and edges (Sousa & Eswaran, 1975).

Feldspar shows pseudomorphic transformation to kaolinite and gibbsite (Ismail, 1981; Thomas et al., 1999) (see Fig. 1). SEM observations of the surface of altered feldspar from a dolerite saprolite reveal abundant elongated etch pits indicating congruent dissolution (Anand & Gilkes, 1984).

Spheroidal weathering producing corestones surrounded by concentric, partially weathered rinds or shells was studied for a saprolite on quartz diorite under a tropical climate (Buss et al., 2008). Disaggregation at the bedrock weathering zone is initiated by spheroidal macrocracking which is favoured by the oxidation of biotite, which is the earliest documented alteration process. Disintegration of the shells to saprolite is marked by extensive microcracking across multiple crystals and by complete weathering of plagioclase and hornblende. Plagioclase weathering starts, within the shells, with partial dissolution and precipitation of secondary phases in the interior of the crystals. Within the shells-protosaprolite zone, chlorite and plagioclase are highly weathered, resulting in a groundmass with low brightness in backscattered electron images. Quartz and hornblende show a high degree of microcracking but remain unaltered. As weathering progresses toward the protosaprolite and saprolite zones, plagioclase is entirely lost and pore space is filled mostly by gibbsite and, to a lesser extent, by kaolinite. Hornblende crystals become gradually smaller, with increasing dissolution features along cracks and cleavage planes, surrounded by gibbsite and kaolinite aggregates.

# 4.1.3 Gabbro

Saprolites on gabbro and metagabbro in a temperate climate were studied by Rice et al. (1985). Hornblende in both rocks is transformed to smectite and goethite, whereas feldspar is weathered to kaolinite. Chlorite is transformed to regularly interstratified chlorite-vermiculite, which alters in turn to randomly interstratified chlorite-vermiculite and smectite.

# 4.1.4 Andesitic Rocks

Andesitic rocks consist of large euhedral and anhedral phenocrysts of plagioclase, alkali feldspar, pyroxenes, biotite and quartz in a fine-grained groundmass of feldspar and quartz or set in an optically isotropic vitric matrix. The saprolite still shows the porphyritic texture of the rock (Fig. 3) (Gu et al., 2007) with some zigzag planar voids (Ibrahim, 1997).

A deep saprolite  $(20 - 30\mathrm{m})$  on a feldspar-rich trachyandesite in SE Australia shows three distinct zones, corresponding to the lower, middle and upper saprolite (Tonui et al., 2003). The abundance of inter- and transmineral fissures increases from the lower toward the upper saprolite. Ferruginous coatings may line these fissures. In the lower saprolite, plagioclase starts to weather to smectite, kaolinite and sericite, and in the upper saprolite it is completely pseudomorphically replaced by a mixture of kaolinite booklets and mica, as shown by SEM observations. Alkali feldspar persists in the upper saprolite.

In the saprock zone of a dacite profile, plagioclase is weathered to kaolinite along cleavage planes and fractures, which is then completely pseudomorphically replaced by kaolinite in the saprolite (Gu et al., 2007). K-feldspar is also highly altered to illite. Halloysite, kaolinite and gibbsite are common alteration products of feldspar, as observed in SEM images. Biotite grains show alteration to chlorite and vermiculite, and they are no longer recognisable in the overlying saprolite.

In saprolites on trachydacite studied by Certini et al. (2006), pyroxenes are altered to kaolinite along cleavage planes and biotite shows a loss of pleochroism, the space along cleavage planes being filled with weakly birefringent material, assumed to be vermiculite, whereas the feldspar is still fresh. The optically isotropic vitric matrix is transformed to a mixture of small birefringent mineral grains and opaque iron oxides.

In temperate environments, pyroxenes still appear fresh while feldspar is partially altered to vermiculite (Drees et al., 2003). In the tropics, the ferromagnesian minerals are

altered to such an extent that the opaque iron oxides that are formed dominate the groundmass (Ibrahim, 1997).

Mulyanto et al. (1999) and Mulyanto and Stoops (2003) studied spheroidal weathering of andesite boulders in tropical environments. Weathering of plagioclase (both phenocrysts and small crystals) passes through successive phases from the centre toward the outer shell of the boulders. Amorphous material, sometimes mixed with kaolinite and/or halloysite, appears first, followed by a predominance of gibbsite, which in the outer shell finally disappears, leaving moldic voids. Pyroxene weathering starts along cleavage planes parallel to [001], which become filled by goethite. Due to congruent dissolution of the pyroxene, empty boxworks are formed that gradually become filled with fine-grained goethite, preserved in the outer shell as goethitic pseudomorphs. Sequential mineral formation in vacuoles (Mulyanto & Stoops, 2003) points to a weathering in distinct, separate phases.

In maritime Antarctica, weathering of andesite affected by hydrothermal mineralisation of pyrite yields an optically isotropic yellowish upper saprolite with a porphyric c/f-related distribution pattern (Schaefer et al., 2008). The groundmass is a mixture of kaolinite and irregular interstratified clay minerals. Oxidation of sulfides results in intense chemical weathering and iron mobilisation with formation of secondary sulfates (jarosite, Na-jarosite) and amorphous iron oxide phases. Most andesitic clasts, with plagioclase as the main phenocryst type, are strongly altered, showing embayments with alteration products and illuvial, amorphous Fe-rich precipitates filling desiccation fractures. Coarse kaolinite fragments indicate intense weathering of plagioclase.

Common pedofeatures are iron oxide nodules and clay coatings covering the sides of voids. The saprolite shows speckled and undifferentiated b-fabrics. Gu et al. (2007) also reported isopachous amorphous silica cement in intergranular voids.

# 4.1.5 Basalt

Basalt generally contains mafic minerals (olivine, pyroxenes), feldspar (plagioclase) and accessory magnetite as phenocrysts, in a matrix of glass or fine-grained feldspar (Fig. 4).

In a cool temperate environment, Glassmann and Simonson (1985) observed an initial stage of pseudomorphic alteration of plagioclase (labradorite) to beidellite. The dissolution voids may also be filled by authigenic clays, such as beidellite, hydrated halloysite, chlorite and gibbsite (Fig. 5). Augite is completely altered, resulting in the formation of smectite or goethite pseudomorphs after augite crystals.

Horváth et al. (2000) observed the relic texture of basaltic rock in a saprolite. Moldic voids derived from olivine, pyroxene and feldspar phenocrysts are always filled by iron oxides. These infillings are commonly recognised in macropores and in intergranular pores. They have orange colour and are composed of thin goethitic-clayey zones parallel to the surface of the irregular voids. Gibbsite is closely related to the strongly intergrown feldspar crystals of the groundmass, coated by iron oxides. Macrocrystalline gibbsite can be seen along some cracks and in voids. In the intergranular space, trace amounts of clay coatings are present.

In a tropical saprolite studied by Eswaran (1972), the first component to disappear is volcanic glass, combined with an enrichment in iron. Clay coatings were observed in some voids.

Schaefer et al. (2008), studying soils derived from basalts in maritime Antarctica, observed the alteration of plagioclase phenocrysts to a dark brown smectitic groundmass, while pyroxene and magnetite were unaltered.

# 4.2 Metamorphic Rocks

# 4.2.1 Gneiss

Several studies describe saprolites developed on gneiss in different climatic conditions (Eswaran & Heng, 1976; Embrechts & Stoops, 1982; Zauyah, 1985; Stolt et al., 1991; Stoops et al., 1994; Bouchard et al., 1995; Kretzschmar et al., 1997; Schwarz, 1997;

Jolicoeur et al., 2000; Le Pera et al., 2001; Schaefer et al., 2002; Ibraimo et al., 2004; Simas et al., 2005; Muggler et al., 2007). Weathering of gneiss produces saprolites that can be very thick ( $>20\mathrm{~m}$ ), with abundant core boulders.

From a micromorphological and mineralogical point of view, two major stages of saprolite development can be recognised. In the first stage, corresponding to the lower saprolite or saprock, the morphological features of the original rock are preserved and physical weathering is the main process, resulting in microfracture development (Zauyah, 1985; Le Pera et al., 2001). Stolt et al. (1991) described the fabric as rock-controlled, based on the parallel orientation of the coarse material and voids in relation to the foliation. The parallel planar voids show iron oxide hypocoatings. The second stage involves further development of microcracks and progressive chemical attack of the minerals along compositional and microstructural discontinuities. Plagioclase shows edge pitting. Clay minerals and ferruginous products formed by alteration replace feldspar, biotite and garnet. The larger grains show weathering features as described by Delvigne (1998), their mineralogical composition differing according to climate or past climate. The groundmass of the saprolite can also contain small diffuse nodules composed of small iron oxide aggregates (Eswaran & Heng, 1976).

Biotite in saprolites developed on gneiss can show evidence of chloritisation (Zauyah, 1985). The usual parallel linear and pellicular alteration (Stolt et al., 1991) produces alteromorphs composed of hydroxyl-interlayered vermiculite, kaolinite and interstratified clays. Kaolinite and halloysite alteromorphs form in humid temperate climates (Kretzschmar et al., 1997), with or without mica-vermiculite intermediate phase (Schwarz, 1997; Jolicoeur et al., 2000). An arrangement of halloysite parallel to the cleavage planes of the biotite crystals was described by Eswaran and Heng (1976). The edges of biotite crystals are covered with tubular halloysite (Kretzschmar et al., 1997) and/or goethite aggregates (Zauyah, 1985; Schwarz, 1997; Le Pera et al., 2001).

In a humid temperate climate, feldspar may be partially altered to kaolinite or gibbsite (Stolt et al., 1991). In the humid tropics, it is completely altered to gibbsite (Simas et al., 2005) or it has an opaque, brownish appearance, due to replacement by a microcrystalline secondary product, probably a clay mineral.

Garnet weathering in gneiss starts with the formation of fissures, which are later filled by iron oxides released by weathering of biotite (Embrechts & Stoops, 1982), finally resulting in a boxwork fabric by congruent dissolution of the remaining garnet residues. Phyllosilicates occurring in cracks within garnet grains have also been reported (Bouchard et al., 1995). Complete replacement by macrocystalline kaolinite booklets was observed in tropical conditions (Muggler et al., 2007).

Other features of saprolites on gneiss include the coexistence of gibbsite and primary minerals (Schwarz, 1997; Schaefer et al., 2002; Ibraimo et al., 2004; Simas et al., 2005), a predominance of gibbsite lithorelict structures as alteromorphs, preserving the original cleavage patterns of feldspars (Delvigne, 1998) and the presence of ferruginous zones along pores, related to intense desilification of mafic minerals (Lacerda et al., 2000; Schaefer, 2001; Simas et al., 2005).

# 4.2.2 Schists

Saprolites on micaschist are deeper in the tropics (about  $8\mathrm{m}$ ; Zauyah, 1986) than in humid temperate conditions (3 m; Kretzschmar et al., 1997). The lower saprolite in the tropics is characterised by a parallel alignment of muscovite and biotite crystals in a matrix of interlocking quartz crystals and straight accommodated voids, parallel to the schistosity. Quartz, microcline and albite also occur as phenoblasts. The transmineral voids become wider toward the upper saprolite. The general weathering trend in schists is that biotite weathers first, followed by feldspar, while muscovite and quartz remain unchanged (Zauyah, 1986).

In both humid temperate and tropical environments, biotite grains exhibit expanded edges or exfoliation and are transformed to kaolinite pseudomorphs. Released iron accumulates as opaque and cryptocrystalline oxides on the edges of the altered biotite or along expanded cleavage planes. In temperate environments, only minor amounts of biotite-vermiculite mixed layers are observed in the clay and silt fractions (Kretzschmar et al., 1997). In the upper saprolite, pedoplasmation of these pseudomorphs is observed (Zauyah, 1987). The alteration pattern of muscovite is similar to that of biotite, i.e., pellicular and linear (Zauyah, 1987).

In the lower saprolite, two types of feldspar weathering (Zauyah, 1986) are observed (i) in situ replacement by gibbsite, and (ii) dissolution creating vacuoles within the grains and embayments along their boundaries. Moreover, the boundaries begin to lose their sharpness by weathering to tubular halloysite as shown by SEM studies.

Quartz phenoblasts ranging in size from 500 to  $260\mu \mathrm{m}$  as well as polycrystalline quartz in the groundmass appear unaltered in the lower saprolite. In the upper saprolite, cracks appear in the larger quartz grains and the polycrystalline aggregates begin to separate (Fig. 6). The cracks are infused by clay or brown iron oxides.

SEM images of almandine grains in a saprolite on micaschist show etch pits, occasionally covered by goethite and hematite coatings (Graham et al., 1989).

Pedofeatures in saprolite on micaschist include iron segregation features parallel to the schistosity, clay coatings in voids and thin ferruginous coatings in transmineral fissures in the upper saprolite (Zauyah, 1986).

# 4.2.3 Amphibolites

The saprolite on an amphibole schist in the tropics comprises many core stones in a looser groundmass (Zauyah & Stoops, 1990). The slightly weathered centre of the cores is composed of alternating bands of epidote-clinozoisite and actinolite. The pale yellow weathering rims in the lower saprolite consist of booklets of veriform kaolinite in a micromass of fine-grained kaolinite and some tubular halloysite (SEM). Parallel-oriented opaque particles mark the original schistosity. In the upper saprolite, the dark brown weathering rim consists of iron oxides forming schistosity-related networks, filled with fine-grained gibbsite and/or kaolinite stained by iron oxides. Based on morphological criteria, gibbsite is believed to be the alteration product of epidote and clinozoisite. Actinolite weathers faster than those two minerals. The brownish soft saprolite between

the core stones still shows a distinct relic schistosity due to the parallel alignments recognised for the goethite framework (SEM), filled with kaolinite booklets and more fine-grained kaolinite, gibbsite being rare. Evidence of faunal activity includes the presence of infillings with excrements and a crescent-like internal fabric, in planar voids that are parallel to the schistosity planes.

In cold temperate climate, a very thin saprolite layer on amphibolite (2 cm) (Protz et al., 1974) shows a lithic fabric with red and golden coatings along the sides of weathered biotite and other mineral grains and within voids. Vermiculite is the dominant clay mineral.

Other pedofeatures observed in saprolites on amphibolite include iron oxide coatings on transmineral voids.

# 4.2.4 Serpentine

Only few studies discuss the micromorphology of saprolites developed on serpentine (García et al., 1974; Zauyah, 1986; Lambiv Dzemua et al., 2011). The lower saprolite of a serpentine profile in a Mediterranean climate shows abundant altered pyroxenes, serpentine, chlorite, plagioclase and chalcedony (García et al., 1974). Iron oxides are deposited between the serpentine grains. In the upper saprolite, serpentine is more weathered, and iron oxides accumulate in fissures. A few manganese oxide nodules are also observed.

In the lower saprolite of a profile on serpentine, composed of antigorite, chrysotile, magnetite and chlorite, in a tropical area, the antigorite crystals remain unchanged (Zauyah, 1986). Magnetite grains show mainly pellicular alteration to iron oxides, and chlorite is partially altered to kaolinite. The lithic fabric is still preserved. Dense, incomplete, ferruginous infillings in planar voids associated with chlorite and chrysotile veins are common.

Replacement of serpentine by kaolinite, with preservation of the lithic fabric, was reported by Lambiv Dzemua et al. (2011). Iron oxide masses replace the dissolved magnesite grains (Fig. 7). Iron oxide hypocoatings and coatings are observed along planar voids and gradually form the only remaining material, as kaolinite disappears in the upper saprolite. Coatings of limpid authigenic clay occur in some voids in the lower saprolite.

# 4.2.5 Phyllites and Slates

Phyllites and slates are fine-grained metamorphic rocks that may produce very thick saprolite zones (Zauyah, 1986; Felix-Henningsen, 1994). In a tropical environment, the saprolite is composed of fine-grained quartz and sericite aligned according to the original schistosity (Zauyah, 1986; Stoops et al., 1990) (Fig. 8). A few muscovite, biotite and graphite grains and iron segregations may occur in the groundmass. Most planar voids are parallel to the foliation and are coated by iron oxides. Some channels and vugs can be present. Weathering of the minerals shows the normal stability trend, i.e., quartz  $>$  muscovite  $>$  biotite. Biotite loses its pleochroism and alters first to a micavermiculite interstratified clay mineral. Sericite weathers to kaolinite with a mosaic-like extinction pattern. Granular hematite becomes more common toward higher parts of the saprolite (Muggler et al., 2001).

Pedofeatures observed in the saprolite include clay coating in voids (Zauyah, 1986).

# 4.3 Sedimentary Rocks

# 4.3.1 Siliciclastic Rocks

Saprolites on shales, siltstones and slates in a tropical climate with savannah vegetation (Muggler et al., 2007) consist predominantly of quartz and fine-grained illite-type mica, with some accessory minerals such as ilmenite. The mica is transformed to hydroxy-Al interlayered vermiculite and kaolinite. Polycrystalline quartz grains are often fractured

and separated into individual grains. Infillings of the fractures with red or dotted clay gives rise to runiquartz (Eswaran et al., 1975).

In a subtropical to tropical region, Islam et al. (2002) studied weathered samples of sedimentary rocks (sandstone, siltstone, shale and claystone), containing quartz, plagioclase, alkali feldspar, biotite, muscovite and lesser carbonates and epidote as the main primary minerals. Quartz starts to weather at the boundaries and along fracture planes, plagioclase shows alteration along cleavage and fracture planes, while the less weatherable alkali feldspar and muscovite began to alter at a later stage along boundaries and cleavage planes.

In saprolites on mudstone and shale in a tropical area, the related distribution pattern is open porphyric and the b-fabric is stipple-speckled (Sugandi, 2005). Pedofeatures observed in these saprolites are large iron oxide nodules with irregular shapes (mottles) and clay coatings along voids.

# 4.3.2 Calcareous Rocks

As a rule, saprolites on calcareous rocks (limestone, dolomite) show complete destruction of the original rock structure due to dissolution and subsequent collapse (Stoops et al., 1979; Stoops & Schaefer, 2010, 2018). Impure limestones such as marls may show complicated patterns.

Micromorphological observations of a limestone saprolite in a humid temperate climate (Lee et al., 1990; McKay et al., 2005) showed that the material was composed of thin  $(0.1 - 1\mathrm{cm})$  undulating layers of limestone and shale/siltstone. Iron oxide coatings occurred along closely spaced planar voids parallel and perpendicular to the bedding, as well as in vugs and channels. Clay infillings were observed in vugs and channels. In the intervals derived from limestone layers, microcrystalline manganese oxide nodules were common.

# 5. Conclusions

Although there is a wealth of information on mineralogical and physicochemical aspects of weathering, relatively few papers deal with of fabric changes. The fabric of saprolites is by definition closely related to the rock fabric but also to the degree and type of weathering. No systematic study exists on differences in fabric developed under different hydrological conditions (below the water table, in the zone of groundwater fluctuations and in the aerated zone), although this might be of great importance.

The presence and development of inter- and transmineral voids plays an important role in the evolution of weathering, but this is not yet well understood (e.g., in the case of spheroidal weathering) and needs to be investigated more in detail. Micromorphometric studies of the porosity of saprolites are practically nonexistent. They could contribute to a better understanding of water movement and storage in saprolites (Trindade et al., 2005).

A better understanding of the fabric of saprolites may be of importance in predicting risks of earth slides. In the tropics, saprolites may be quite rapidly transformed to a lateritic or bauxitic material, and therefore not recognised as such. Information on the fabric of saprolites in temperate regions is rather restricted.

# 1. Introduction

In the general process of soil formation, the transformation of rock into soil parent material is followed by the vertical differentiation of the soil material into horizons (pedogenesis). In the first stage, the situation is different for loose sediments and for coherent rocks. The transformation of loose sediments to soil material is mainly a matter of pedoturbation, especially bioturbation (see also Kooistra & Pulleman, 2010, 2018). For coherent rocks, two discrete steps can be distinguished: (i) weathering, giving rise to a saprolite, which is reviewed by Zauyah et al. (2010, 2018), and (ii) homogenisation resulting in the transformation of the saprolite into soil material (pedoplasmation), which is the subject of the present chapter.

Flach et al. (1968) introduced the term 'pedoplasmation', which they defined as 'the transformation of weathered rock (saprolite) to soil B horizons'. In the case of deep tropical soils, it would have been more appropriate to speak more generally of transformation to loose soil parent material rather than to B horizons. It can then be considered as a type of proanisotropic pedoturbation, forming a layer of soil parent material over saprolite (Johnson et al., 1987, Johnson & Watson-Steger, 1990). Because transformation of isovolumetrically weathered rock fragments to soil material also happens in higher parts of the profile (e.g., in soils on colluvial material), we propose to extend the term pedoplasmation to a more general concept of 'in situ transformation of lithic fabrics to soil fabrics'. Although the term 'plasma' (Kubiëna, 1938; Brewer, 1964) as such has been abandoned in micromorphology, the term pedoplasmation is still in use, meaning the in situ development of a structured, loose material in which the original fabric of the saprolite or sediment is no longer visible. Other terms have been used to refer to this process. Romashkevich (1964) described the transformation of 'weathering crust' to 'active soil material', and she later called this process 'soil formation' (Romashkevich, 1965; Romashkevich et al., 1977). Fölster (1971) used the word 'homogenisation', and Nahon (1991) used the general term 'pedoturbation'.

The boundary between saprolite and totally pedoplasmated material (the so-called pedoplasmation front) can be sharp (even represented in a single thin section) or gradual, as already noticed by Harrison (1933) in his classic work on various igneous rocks from Guyana. The thickness of the pedoplasmation zone can reach several decimetres or metres on coarse-grained rocks in the tropics, and the zone can be almost absent on fine-grained, quartz-free material. Pedoplasmation, therefore, is best studied by comparing sequential thin sections, from the saprolite upward. In arid zones, where weathering is slower than pedoturbation, no pedoplasmation zone is observed, except on palaeosaprolites formed during stages with other climatic conditions.

Pedoplasmaton does not only take place at the upper boundary of the saprolite, but also in some preferential spots, such as along diaclasses (Beaudou & Chatelin, 1979). According to Flach et al. (1968), the chemical and mineralogical composition of the material does not change during this process, although several physicochemical changes are noticed, such as an increase in clay content, linear extensibility and dispersibility of the soil, indicating that the process is not restricted to simple mixing. These authors considered pedoplasmaton as an in situ rearrangement of constituents without input or output of materials. However, this isochemical and isomineral pedoplasmaton is generally accompanied by an exchange of components, in suspension or in solution, vertically laterally or both. The most visible result of this exchange in thin sections is the presence of clay coatings (Beaudou & Chatelin, 1979) and the crystallisation of minerals in pores (e.g., gibbsite) (Stoops et al., 1990; Stoops, 1991) or in the groundmass (e.g., diffuse iron oxide nodules). The introduction of organic substances can also play an important role in the arrangement of components due to the development of organomineral complexes (Romashkevich et al., 1977). The newly formed minerals (e.g., clay minerals,

gibbsite, calcite) in the created porosity are often different from those in the groundmass because other thermodynamic conditions prevailed there (Tardy & Novikoff, 1988). Kew et al. (2010) compared physical parameters of pedoplasmated zones with those of indurated or compacted subsoil materials of fluvial and aeolian origin. Based on SEM and microprobe analyses they concluded that those subsoil materials have a less porous micromass than saprolite that shows a certain degree of pedoplasmation, possibly due to closer packing of clay particles.

With few exceptions, no systematic study of the micromorphological aspects of pedoplasmation has been published so far. This chapter is therefore mainly based on the works of Nahon (1991), Stoops (1991) and the authors. Most other available publications discuss deeply weathered soils in the tropics (Fölster, 1971; Beaudou & Chatelin, 1979; Stoops, 1989; Stoops et al., 1990; Muggler & Buurman, 1997; Nunes et al., 2000; Schaefer, 2001; Muggler et al., 2007), and a few deal with palaeosols in the Mediterranean region (e.g., Romashkevich et al., 1977; Martin-Garcia et al., 1999; Gerasimova & Gurov, 2012).

# 2. General Features

Pedoplasmation is expressed by changes in various micromorphological features. In most cases a gradual transition exists between a complete saprolite fabric, a continuous saprolite fabric with pedoplasmated spots, a continuous soil fabric with saprolite remains and finally a complete soil fabric (Fölster, 1971; Stoops et al., 1990; Stoops, 1991) (Fig. 1).

Sometimes pedoplasmation results in the formation of millimetre- or centimetre-sized parallel layers with alternating lithic fabrics and soil fabrics, as a result of repeated

small-scale shears formed in the upper part of the saprolite (Curmi, 1979). At the contact with the overlying mass movement deposit, a breccia-like microstructure can be formed as a result of mechanical friction. Examples of this phenomenon were described by Altemüller (1960) in the C horizon of soils on marl along the contact with a solifluction deposit.

The lithic fabric is preserved for a longer time in spots with iron oxide impregnation than in their surroundings (Fölster, 1971). In the centre of ferruginous nodules in the lower part of laterite profiles, lithic fabrics are gradually transformed to soil fabrics as a result of continuous recrystallisation of kaolinite, whereby large kaolinite mesomorphs after biotite are converted to increasingly fine-grained kaolinite aggregates with random fabric (Muller & Bocquier, 1987). In most cases, changes occur over a very short distance between the saprolite and the overlying pedoplasmated zone. In saprolites developed from gneiss and granitic rocks, kaolinite pseudomorphs after biotite and feldspar are common. They are progressively incorporated into the soil by biological activity, but they survive as rare alteromorphic domains within the oxic Bw horizon, due to upward transport by termite activity (Pinto, 1971; Nunes et al., 2000; Schaefer, 2001).

When checking the use of the term pedoplasmation in earth science literature, it appears that it is often misused to describe simply pedoturbation, which can cause confusion.

# 3. Disappearance of the Original Rock Fabric

The preserved lithic fabric in a saprolite is formed by a mixture of relict minerals (e.g., quartz) and alteromorphs (e.g., clays after feldspar or biotite, goethite after olivine or garnet) (Nahon, 1991). As weathering progresses, two major features are observed in the pedoplasmation zone: loss of the outlines of the clay alteromorphs and fragmentation of the ferruginous or gibbsite pseudomorphs and resistant primary minerals (Fig. 2A and B). Deformation of the fabric due to volume increase during weathering, such as pseudomorphic weathering of biotite to kaolinite with extension along the c-axis, has been observed in granite (Stoops, 1991) (Fig. 2C) and gneiss (Nunes et al., 2000). Deformation can also develop as a result of pressure exerted during crystal growth, for example during formation of calcite (Fig. 2D) or gypsum in arid environments or gibbsite in tropical areas.

Another observed feature is the loss of optical continuity between fragments of fractured coarse groundmass components (Nahon, 1991). An example is rotation and progressive separation of the fragments of fractured quartz grains (see Marcelino et al., 2018; Stoops & Marcelino, 2018). A special case is pedoplasmation of saprolites derived from sedimentary rocks or foliated metamorphic rocks, marked by the disturbance and eventual disappearance of the parallel arrangement of constituents, which is mainly a consequence of pedoturbation. SEM studies on weathered mica schist gravels revealed the importance of local clay illuviation in the disruption of the original schistosity (Martin-Garcia et al., 1999).

Overall, bioturbation is the main process contributing to the destruction of the saprolite fabric and further homogenisation, giving rise to voids (channels, chambers, vugs) (Fig. 3) and passage features (Fig. 4A). The latter seem to be less abundant on coarse-grained saprolites (e.g., on granite) than on fine-grained materials, probably because the size of the constituents exceeds the transport capabilities of the soil mesofauna (Stoops, 1991). Clusters of pellets formed by termite activity are commonly observed (e.g., Martins, 2007).

The collapse of moldic voids formed by congruent dissolution also plays a role during early stages of pedoplasmation, when part of the outlines of the dissolved minerals is still recognisable. This process is particularly important in limestone transformation, producing weathering profiles in which saprolite fabrics are virtually absent, as described in Section 6.

# 4. Development of Microstructure and Porosity

Whereas the saprolite is massive, a pedal microstructure gradually develops during pedoplasmation (Beaudou & Chatelin, 1979), accompanied by an increase in porosity (Hamdan et al., 2003). Increased development of structural units with decreasing ped size has been observed in well-drained deep B horizons of Oxisols (Muggler & Buurman, 1997). However, this seems not to be the case when hydromorphic conditions prevail, as for instance in mottled clays with a massive microstructure (Stoops et al., 1990). In this case, iron oxides are removed in parts of the saprolite, which results in a decrease in aggregate stability, an enhancement of the face-to-face arrangement of clay particles and a decrease in total porosity.

In saprolites, only moldic voids and contact voids (within the alteromorphs) are generally present. In the soil material, new voids are progressively formed by bioturbation (channels, chambers, vugs), by collapse of moldic voids formed by congruent dissolution (irregular vugs) and by shearing and drying (planar voids). This can give rise to local changes of mineral equilibrium conditions, resulting for instance in the precipitation of gibbsite in voids, whereas the groundmass remains kaolinitic (Fig. 3) (Tardy & Novikoff, 1988).

# 5. Other Changes

# 5.1 Changes in Grain-Size Distribution

The fragmentation of coarse constituents, mostly quartz (see Section 3), results in particle size changes from coarse/medium sand to fine sand/silt. In addition, decrease in silt content and increase in clay content are also typical features of pedoplasmation. This is observed in thin sections and in the field and also corroborated by the results of physical analyses. Grain-size distribution changes are also caused both by the comminution and dissolution of silt- and sand-sized kaolinite booklets and by the neoformation of clay minerals (Beaudou & Chatelin, 1979; Muggler & Buurman, 1997). Muggler et al. (2007) stress that comminution alone cannot explain the change and that an observed decrease in crystallinity of kaolinite indicates that a process of dissolution and neoformation must be active (see also Muller & Bocquier, 1987). The abrupt loss of kaolinite crystallinity in the pedoplasmation zone (e.g., Varajão et al., 2001; Melo et al., 2001, 2002) could be attributed to ingestion of soil by termites, in whose digestive track the pH is higher than 12, accounting for greater silicate dissolution (Schaefer, 2001).

# 5.2 Colour Homogenisation and Limpidity Changes

Saprolites are heterogeneous at the microscopic scale. Pedoplasmatism gradually leads to homogenisation of the original material. Tropical saprolites generally show a juxtaposition of white zones (clay) and dark red or opaque zones rich in iron oxides (hematite, goethite), which after pedoplasmation form a uniform light reddish or orange material (Fig. 4B)

(Muggler & Buurman, 1997). An increase of the free iron content in the homogeneous material has been reported (Beaudou & Chatelin, 1979; Stoops et al., 1990).

Besides the well-expressed colour homogenisation, changes in limpidity are observed as well. Starting from a clustered distribution, a random distribution of dispersed fine opaque particles gradually appears (dotted or speckled limpidity). This feature is often overlooked in micromorphological studies. Total homogenisation is reached only after several cycles of pedoplasmation (Fölster, 1971; Stoops et al., 1990) (Fig. 5A). An indication for this in thin sections is the observation that the last generation of passage features is more homogeneous than earlier generations.

# 5.3 Changes of the b-Fabric

During pedoplasmation, the orientation of clay particles in the alteromorphs is destroyed, resulting in the appearance of other b-fabrics. Muggler and Buurman (1997) report the presence of undifferentiated b-fabrics or only weakly expressed other b-fabrics in soils developed from phyllites. In the case of saprolites derived from siltstones and shales, which originally have a strial b-fabric, the randomisation of the clay domains leads to the development of striated, speckled or even undifferentiated b-fabrics in the pedoplasmated material (Dasog et al., 1987; Stoops, unpublished data) (Fig. 5B). The type of b-fabric formed is most probably related to the active type of pedoturbation process, but no information is available on this issue.

# 6. Pedoplasmaton on Carbonate Rocks

Pedoplasmaton on carbonate rocks is a specific case, where a generalised dissolution results in the total collapse of the rare weathering residue. This mechanism was first described by Stoops and Mathieu (1970) for clay with chert (argile à silex), the weathering product of chert-bearing chalk, in a region with a loess cover and is illustrated in Figure 6. A three-dimensional network of fissures is first formed near the

surface of the parent rock, separating millimetre- or centimetre-sized blocks of chalk. The fissures become gradually more numerous and are widened by dissolution, and coatings and infillings of limpid fine clay develop (Fig. 6A and B). The chalk blocks gradually disappear, leaving only a small amount of insoluble weathering residue (clay, fine sand, chert) (Fig. 6C). Due to the collapse of the dissolution cavities, the clay coatings are fragmented and closely packed, forming a residue with a breccia-like fabric (Fig. 6D and E), which becomes more and more homogeneous toward the top. The illuvial clay is largely derived from the remobilisation of clay in the uppermost part of the alteration zone but may also partly originate from the overlying loess soil (Luvisol), as can be deduced from its mineralogical composition (Stoops & Mathieu, 1970; Buurman et al., 1985). The same breccia-like fabric of randomly packed fragments of clay coatings was observed in a similar context (Thorez et al., 1971; Buurman et al., 1985). Brewer et al. (1983) describe a similar fabric (papular fabric) on weathered pyroclastic material.

# 7. Conclusions

Pedoplasmation is not always apparent in a single thin section. A comparative study of sequential samples of undisturbed regolith is often needed and large thin sections are recommended for such studies. Pedoplasmation is the result of a combination of various physicochemical and biological processes, whose interaction is not well understood. Bioturbation plays an important role in the widespread turnover of soil materials and the structural changes observed at a microscopic scale, in the transition zone between the saprolite and the soil.

Most studies on pedoplasmation were performed for deeply weathered soils in the tropics and palaeosols in the Mediterranean region. Research on the transition of weathered rock to soil material at shallower depths in temperate, cold and arid environments needs more attention. The transformation of unconsolidated sediments to soil parent material is poorly documented in the literature, except for the role of bioturbation, and research is also necessary in this field.

# 1. Introduction

Most publications dealing with the interpretation of thin section or SEM observations of soils and regoliths focus on the presence and composition of pedofeatures. For specific soil types, much attention has also been given to microstructure development. In contrast, information about groundmass composition and fabric is relatively limited, with some exceptions (e.g., FitzPatrick, 1984, 1993). Nevertheless, the groundmass is commonly an important source of information about the nature of the parent material and about pedogenic processes. For some soil materials, such as deep soil horizons and weakly developed soils, it can be the only available source of micromorphological data. This is also the case for many soils transformed by human activities (cf. Adderley et al., 2018). The aim of this chapter is therefore to compile information that is useful for the interpretation of groundmass characteristics.

Traditionally, a coarse fraction and a fine fraction are distinguished for micromorphological descriptions. These two fractions have been called 'skeleton' and 'plasma' (Kubiëna, 1938), 'skeleton grains' and 'plasma' (Brewer, 1960, 1964b), 'f-members' and 'f-matrix' (Brewer & Pawluk, 1975; Brewer & Sleeman, 1988) and 'coarse material' and

'fine material' or 'micromass' (Stoops & Jongerius, 1975; Bullock et al., 1985; Stoops, 2003). The skeleton grain/plasma concept of Brewer (1964b) is based not only on grain size but also on mobility and solubility, whereby plasma is composed of material that is easily moved, reorganised or concentrated by soil-forming processes, including all material of colloidal size  $(< 2\mu \mathrm{m})$  and soluble compounds. In practice, the skeleton grain/plasma concept is difficult to apply systematically for various reasons, including its promotion of all particles that are larger than  $2\mu \mathrm{m}$  to skeleton grain status, the difficult detection of weakly contrasting small particles, and the dependence of solubility on soil conditions. Moreover, only single mineral grains are considered as skeleton grains, whereas all compound grains, such as rock fragments, are classified as pedological features (lithorelicts). The coarse/fine concept, introduced by Stoops and Jongerius (1975), eliminates these problems by being based exclusively on size, with size limits that are defined by the user for each individual case. Using particle size as a criterion has been opposed by FitzPatrick (1984, 1993), referring to the continuity in grain size that is observed for many soils, but he nevertheless uses a similar concept ('matrix') that corresponds to a continuous fine fraction. It is clear that mixing various concepts, such as plasma, micromass and matrix, is erroneous and should be avoided, also because some terms have a different meaning in different systems.

In this chapter, coarse material, fine material and c/f-related distribution patterns are discussed under separate headings. The general outline is based in part on the review by Stoops (2015a, 2015b). For practical reasons, we use  $10\mu \mathrm{m}$  as limit between the coarse and fine fractions, in view of standard thin section thickness and of the magnification that is reached by most optical microscopes.

As discussed in this chapter, the coarse fraction is mainly inherited from the parent material, and its thin section study can document various aspects that are not revealed by mineralogical or chemical analysis of bulk samples. The fine fraction can be either inherited or formed in situ by weathering of coarse components or by precipitation from soil solutions. Some information about its composition can be gained from thin section studies, and its b-fabric can provide a record of soil behaviour. Orientation and distribution patterns offer information about the nature and alteration of the parent material and about pedogenic processes.

# 2. Coarse Fraction

The study of the coarse material allows obtaining information about several important aspects of soil materials: (i) origin of the parent material, by providing information on the rock type from which it developed, (ii) profile homogeneity, by revealing vertical variations in the composition, nature and relative abundance of coarse components, (iii) contamination by aeolian material and other surface deposits, including anthropogenic material, by showing the presence of components that cannot be derived from the local rock or sediment substrate, and (iv) occurrence and degree of alteration, providing

information about the type and duration of soil development, as well as about the nature of the parent material.

Some information concerning the coarse fraction can also be obtained through other methods, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, grain mount study of the heavy mineral fraction and grain size analysis, but thin section studies can limit or eliminate the need to apply such other methods. In addition, thin section observations can have various advantages over other methods: (i) rock fragments can be identified, (ii) grain morphology and alteration patterns can be determined, (iii) different types of the same mineral species can be distinguished, based on characteristics such as colour and the presence of inclusions, (iv) amorphous inorganic components such as opal and volcanic glass, as well as organic constituents, can be detected, (v) certain components occurring in abundances below the detection limit of bulk sample analysis are easily recognised, and (vi) information can be obtained for units that are too thin or small for easy subsampling for other analyses. As an alternative optical method, grain mount analysis yields results that are more quantitative, but thin section studies have the advantage of allowing the study of coarser mineral grains, easier mineral identification due to standard section thickness, better recognition of internal features of mineral grains, and identification of rock fragments (Stoops & Van Driessche, 2007). The same identification possibilities are offered by thin sections of coarse fractions obtained by sieving, with the added advantage of yielding more representative results for the coarse fraction of clayey soil materials.

The coarse fraction is composed of mineral grains, rock fragments, coarse organic components, inorganic components of biological origin, and anthropogenic materials. Organic components are not considered in this review, and inorganic biogenic components and anthropogenic constituents are only briefly discussed (see Section 2.3), as they are treated in extenso in other chapters of this book.

In documenting the presence of specific minerals, thin section observations can provide information that is required for soil classification, including the absence of weatherable minerals as requirement for Oxisols and the presence of volcanic glass for vitric characteristics (Soil Survey Staff, 2014). In the same way, thin section studies can provide information about reserves of certain nutrients, as well as possible sources of toxic elements. For nutrient status, thin sections permit the description and identification of mineral grains and rock fragments that are larger than  $2\mathrm{mm}$ , which allows to correct results of routine analyses in soil science, for which this fraction is systematically removed and neglected. The importance of considering the coarse fraction was already pointed out by Lelong (1967), and it has been confirmed by some later studies (e.g., Certini et al., 2004; De Leon-Gonzalez et al., 2007; Sanborn, 2010; Small et al., 2014).

# 2.1 Mineral Grains

In this section, only minerals that are part of the parent material, or added to the profile by later incorporation of surface deposits, are described and discussed. Pedogenic minerals, ranging from halides to authigenic silicates and iron oxides, are covered in

various other chapters of this book. Information about non-pedogenic occurrences of minerals that are mainly relevant as pedogenic phases (e.g., gypsum, pyrite) is also contained in other chapters. In principle, nearly all known minerals can be present as part of the coarse fraction of the groundmass, but only the most common rock-forming minerals will be discussed. In saprolites or soils on specific rock types or on ore deposits, various other minerals can obviously occur in important quantities.

It is not the aim of this chapter to provide exhaustive crystallographic and optical information about selected minerals or to present a key for their optical identification. Readers are referred to the many excellent manuals on optical mineralogy that have been published in several languages, including several well-illustrated atlases (e.g., MacKenzie & Guilford, 1980; MacKenzie & Adams, 1994; Melgarejo, 1997; Pichler & Schmitt-Riegraf, 1997; Perkins & Henke, 2004). Identification of minerals based on their optical properties requires a minimum knowledge of optical mineralogy, for which various handbooks are available (e.g., Parfenoff et al., 1970; Nesse, 2003). A short description of the optical characteristics, occurrence and alteration features of the most important rock-forming minerals occurring in the coarse fraction of soils is presented in the Annex of this chapter.

For soils developed on sedimentary parent materials, grain properties such as size distribution and degree of rounding can be determined and interpreted as described in handbooks on sediment petrology (e.g., Tucker, 2001; Boggs, 2009).

# 2.1.1 Mineralogical Composition and Internal Fabric

Mineral associations, as determined by thin section studies and other methods, will strongly differ between soils formed on contrasting parent materials, such as granite and basalt. For parent materials with similar mineralogical compositions, thin section observations can provide information that is otherwise unavailable. For instance, soils on granite and gneiss may have a similar mineralogical composition, but the shape and internal fabric of coarse mineral grains will be different, most prominently through the presence of quartz with undulose extinction in metamorphic rocks.

For parent material characterisation, including recognition of lithological discontinuities, micromorphological studies can identify differences that remain undetected by XRD analysis. Examples include the recognition of colour varieties (e.g., green vs brown biotite or hornblende), the presence of mineral, glass or fluid inclusions (e.g., basaltic glass in feldspar), and the presence of zoning or exsolution. Indications of weathering can be detected to distinguish vertical trends that are related to parent material heterogeneity or postdepositional alteration.

# 2.1.2 Alteration

Only few reviews of micromorphological aspects of mineral alteration have been published, including the book by Delvigne (1998) and a short paper by Delvigne and Stoops (1990).

The description of the type and degree of alteration of coarse mineral grains, and the nature of their alteration products, is important for the interpretation of the coarse fraction of the groundmass. The term alteration is used here in a wide sense, as proposed by Stoops et al. (1979), covering changes caused both by geological processes (e.g., burial diagenesis, deuteric reactions, hydrothermal activity) and by pedogenic processes. The latter type of alteration, resulting from interaction with atmospheric agents and organisms in earth-surface conditions, is generally called weathering. It is evident, but sometimes overlooked by micromorphologists, that changes requiring high temperatures or pressures cannot take place in soils and therefore cannot be interpreted as pedogenic.

Susceptibility to alteration is a reflection of mineral stability in soil environments, which is determined by many factors, including temperature, moisture conditions, pH, redox conditions, degree of leaching, and the nature, composition and grain size of the mineral. A discussion of these factors is beyond the scope of this chapter but can be found in other publications (e.g., Nahon, 1991). For intrinsic mineral stability, a sequence was already proposed by Goldich (1938), limited to minerals that are common in magmatic rocks. He proposed two parallel series, one from olivine over augite and hornblende to biotite, and the other from Ca-rich to Na-rich plagioclase, both continued by a series from potassium feldspar over muscovite to quartz. Related efforts for mineral stability classification are various weathering indexes, based on chemical composition and crystal structure (e.g., Reiche, 1950; Parker, 1970; Nesbitt & Young, 1982, 1984). These approaches are not always applicable because other factors may interfere. For instance, augite may be less stable than associated olivine in basalt because of its prominent cleavage (Brewer, 1964b; Stoops, 2013). Classifications of mineral stability that have been proposed in sedimentology are also not entirely suitable in pedology because they take physical stability during transport into account, which is not clearly relevant for soil environments (e.g., Boswell, 1941; Pettijohn et al., 2012).

Alteration of mineral grains can occur in the form of transformation to newly formed mineral phases, but it can also consist of congruent dissolution, without in situ formation of alteration products. In this case, with calcite and quartz dissolution as common examples, circumgranular voids (also called contact voids) are formed, separating the affected grain from surrounding or neighbouring components. This space can later be filled with other minerals, giving the false impression of mineral transformation or coupled dissolution-precipitation. In these and other contexts, formation of an enclosing mineral phase can contribute to dissolution of the surrounded grain through the effect of crystallisation pressure on solubility. After complete dissolution of a mineral grain, a mouldic void, preserving the original shape of the grain, can be left, if the surrounding material is sufficiently coherent. This has mostly been documented for minerals such as gypsum or calcite, but under tropical conditions it can also occur for less soluble minerals such as quartz. After their development, mouldic voids can be filled with authigenic minerals, resulting in the development of pseudomorphs after the dissolved

phase. The same result can be reached by gradual dissolution and mineral formation, which often requires input of elements from external sources. Examples include goethite pseudomorphs after garnet, requiring Fe input, and gibbsite pseudomorphs after feldspar, requiring Al input (see Annex).

In the case of alteration through mineral transformation, a certain crystallographic relationship can exist between the original phase and its transformation product (topotactic replacement; e.g., vermiculite after biotite (see Fig. 1E and F), and IDDingsite after olivine (see Fig. 5E and F)) (see Annex).

When a mineral is completely replaced by newly formed material, by dissolution-precipitation or transformation, an 'alteromorph' is formed, preserving the original boundaries of the weathered mineral. Alteration is described as isomorphous when the alteromorph has the same shape and size as the original mineral grain, mesomorphous when the shape has been preserved but the size has changed in one or two directions, and katamorphous when the shape has been completely lost (Stoops et al., 1979). More detailed subdivisions have been proposed by Delvigne (1998).

Polyphase or polygenic alteration is a common phenomenon. The original mineral is in that case altered to another product, which is, in turn, transformed to another phase. For instance, hornblende in igneous rocks can be altered to biotite by late-magmatic alteration, followed by biotite transformation to vermiculite and next to kaolinite in soil conditions, resulting in kaolinite alteromorphs after hornblende. If the first step of non-pedogenic alteration is not complete, two associated inherited mineral phases remain side by side, which may alter subsequently following different pathways, making interpretation quite difficult. Such complex situations can only be studied using microscopic techniques. More examples are given by Delvigne (1998). During pedoplasmatism, most unstable alteromorphs are destroyed (see Stoops & Schaefer, 2018).

For the description of morphological types and degrees of alteration, the terminology of Bullock et al. (1985) and Stoops (2003), first proposed by Stoops et al. (1979), is available. Pellicular and irregular linear weathering patterns are commonly observed for minerals without well-expressed cleavage or fracture patterns (e.g., garnet, olivine), whereas parallel and cross-linear patterns point to minerals with prominent clear cleavage (e.g., pyroxenes, amphiboles, micas).

Besides chemical weathering, also physical weathering is visible in thin sections. The most important processes are fracturing by growth of ice or pedogenic minerals in cracks. The latter include salt weathering, which is mainly observed for arid environments, but similar processes can take place in tropical soils, for instance through gibbsite formation. Because the mineralogical and chemical composition of the grains does not change, this process cannot be detected by various methods, except thin section studies and grain-size analyses.

More information about mineral weathering is given in the chapter on saprolites (Zauyah et al., 2018). It should, however, be kept in mind that weathering in soils is often different from weathering in saprolites, where other conditions of permeability, pH or Eh and microbiological activity prevail.

# 2.2 Rock Fragments

Rock fragments are often a quantitatively important component of the coarse fraction of the groundmass, especially in young soils and weakly weathered materials. They can help to identify the parent material or the underlying rock substrate, and to recognise the addition of volcanic or aeolian material, as well as to assess the degree of weathering.

# 2.2.1 Identification and Occurrence

Identification of rock fragments is based on a combination of fabric characteristics and mineralogical composition.

The fabric of a rock, generally referred to as texture or structure by petrographers, is described in terms of absolute and relative grain size of the crystals, their shape and arrangement. For the three main categories of rocks that are distinguished, i.e., igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary, specific terms that are widely used to describe their texture are available.

Most igneous rocks and all metamorphic rocks are composed entirely of crystals (holocrystalline). Some volcanic rocks are composed mainly of volcanic glass (holohyaline or vitric) or composed of both glass and crystals (hypocrystalline). The distinction between vitric, hypocrySTALLine and holocrystalline is especially important when studying soils on tephra, as pedogenesis can be different for each type of material (e.g., Stoops, 2013). Igneous rocks almost always lack specific distribution and orientation patterns, except for occasional clusters or flow structures, whereas most common metamorphic rocks often show a clear parallel distribution and orientation pattern.

Clastic sedimentary rocks range in composition from claystone to conglomerate, but intergrades are most common, with an array of sand/clay ratios and distribution patterns. For calcareous sedimentary rocks, detailed systems of terminology have been developed for rock types and their components, including the widely used systems proposed by Dunham (1962) and Folk (1962). Diagenetic transformation of sedimentary deposits can involve the development of carbonate, silica or iron oxide cements as important components.

In describing the mineralogical composition of rock fragments, names of mineral species or groups are used. For igneous rocks, a distinction is commonly made between felsic minerals (quartz, feldspars and feldspathoids), with mostly light colours, and mafic minerals (e.g., amphiboles, pyroxenes, olivine, mica, opaque minerals), with mostly dark colours.

In naming igneous and metamorphic rocks, only terms that were defined and approved by nomenclature subcommissions of the International Union of Geological Sciences should be used (Le Maitre, 2002; Fettes & Desmons, 2007). Many rock types are part of a continuum, separated by quantitative limits that were agreed upon by convention. When the required quantitative data, in a statistically significant manner, cannot be obtained for rock fragments in thin sections, it is recommended to describe their fabric and composition rather than giving them a name. For igneous rocks, the field name categories proposed by Le Maitre (2002, p. 29, p. 39) can be used in this case.

Fragments of coarse-grained rocks can pose a specific problem, because the observed volume in relatively small thin section is typically not sufficiently large to be representative. Additional difficulties include optical identification of plagioclase composition for certain magmatic rocks, and uncertainty regarding rock fragment orientation that can hinder recognition of foliated metamorphic rocks. Moreover, identifications can be complicated by differential alteration, whereby the most unstable components are first destroyed. In this case, alteration products can provide some information about the nature of the altered phase.

Identification of rock fragments in thin sections requires a basic knowledge of petrography. Many useful atlases and manuals are available (e.g., MacKenzie & Guilford, 1980; MacKenzie et al., 1982; Adams et al., 1984; Yardley et al., 1990; MacKenzie & Adams, 1994; Melgarejo, 1997; Pichler & Schmitt-Riegraf, 1997; Adams & MacKenzie, 1998; Perkins & Henke, 2004). For the description of volcanic material in soils, information can be found in some review articles (e.g., De Paepe & Stoops, 2007; see also Stoops et al., 2018).

# 2.2.2 Alteration

Although alteration of rock fragments in soils may be quite different from that of the same rock in a saprolite, useful information on the topic can be found in some other chapters (Zauyah et al., 2018; Stoops et al., 2018), as well as in the book by Delvigne (1998).

# 2.3 Other Components

Besides mineral grains and rock fragments, some other types of mineral components can occur as part of the coarse fraction of the groundmass. Because they are covered in other chapters, only a brief overview is provided here, in the form of tables, both for mineral components of biological origin (Table 1) and for anthropogenic components (Table 2).

For mineral components of biological origin (Table 1), a distinction is made between remnants consisting of opal, calcium carbonates, hydroxylapatite and ceratine. In thin sections, opal is characterised by optical isotropy and relatively low relief. Calcium carbonates show high-order interference colours and negative to strongly positive relief. As example of hydroxylapatite occurrences only bone is considered here, composed of a mixture of hydroxylapatite and collagen. In thin sections, bone is characterised by light yellowish colours (PPL), first-order white to grey interference colours (XPL) and strong blue (UVF) or greenish (BLF) fluorescence. For calcareous remains, thin section identification is covered in various excellent handbooks (e.g., Adams & MacKenzie, 1998; Scholle & Ulmer-Scholle, 2003; Flügel, 2010).

Anthropogenic components are obviously mainly observed for archaeological materials and Technosols (e.g., Charzynski et al., 2013), but they can also be encountered in cultivated soils (e.g., plaggen soils, Amazonian Dark Earths), mass-transported materials (e.g., colluvium) and tsunami deposits (e.g., Bruins et al., 2008).

various types of anthropogenic coarse components can be found in several chapters of the volume edited by Nicosia and Stoops (2017), and some information is compiled in Table 2.

# 3. Micromass

Whereas coarse material provides important information about parent material and degree of weathering, the composition and fabric of the micromass are a source of information about alteration, soil evolution, and mechanical behaviour. Several pedogenic changes affecting the micromass are recorded as matrix pedofeatures, which are not considered in this chapter.

# 3.1 Composition

Using a  $10\mu \mathrm{m}$  c/f limit, the micromass appears uniform, as most particles are beyond the resolution that can be reached when a standard optical microscope and thin section thickness are used. Only contrasting small particles, such as opaque grains, and mineral grains with high interference colours, such as calcite or mica (sericite) particles, can be detected individually. For other micromass components, characteristics such as colour, limpidity and birefringence can be recognised for domains with strong parallel orientation of fine particles, if not masked by other components (e.g., iron oxides, organic material, carbonates).

Colour - Most types of clay have a greyish colour. Chlorite and glauconite, which are greenish, are rare exceptions. Such minerals can be dominant micromass components, as reported mainly for glauconite (De Coninck & Laruelle, 1964; Skiba et al., 2014; see also Annex). A reddish colour is always associated with the presence of fine hematite (see Marcelino et al., 2018; Stoops & Marcelino, 2018). Intensely reddish colours are already observed at hematite contents of  $10\%$  (Baert & Van Ranst, 1997). A yellow or yellowish brown colour seems associated with the presence of goethite in the clay fraction, but also ferrihydrite might be responsible. Brown to purplish brown colours can be caused by the presence of organic material. The staining effect of iron oxides is clearly demonstrated by selective dissolution treatment of uncovered thin sections (Arocena et al., 1990), and similar tests exist for organic matter (Babel, 1964; see also Stoops, 2003). Changes in colour of Bt horizons in a soil sequence, evaluated by digital measurements, reveal changes in parent material composition (Brzychcy et al., 2012).

Limpidity – The limpidity of the micromass may yield information about particle size. The finer the particle size, the more limpid the micromass will appear. Based on observations for illuvial clay coatings, complete limpidity is reached when the

clay is finer than  $0.2\mu \mathrm{m}$ . Limpidity is strongly reduced by the presence of contrasting small particles (e.g., organic material). A cloudy limpidity has been described for materials with high concentrations of cryptocrystalline gibbsite (Bennema et al., 1970; Marcelino et al., 2018; Stoops & Marcelino, 2018).

Birefringence - Low interference colours (first-order grey) generally point to kaolinite, chlorite or palygorskite-sepiolite compositions. Higher interference colours are only compatible with 2:1 phyllosilicate minerals, such as mica, vermiculite and smectite.

# 3.2 Fabric

Russian micromorphologists have a long tradition of describing the fabric of the fine material, as microtexture, using national sedimentological terminology (see Dobrovol'ski, 1983, 1991). In other parts of the world, micromass fabrics have received systematic attention only since the 1960s, when Brewer (1964a, 1964b) formulated concepts and terminology to describe the 'plasmic fabrics' of fine material (Table 3). Based on the work of Brewer and Russian authors, the concept of 'b-fabric' was introduced by Bullock et al. (1985). The earlier Russian concepts often seem inconsistent to non-Russian scientists, but this is mainly explained by the use of different expressions for the same term in translations.

aReview of Russian literature.

The presence of optically anisotropic zones showing interference colours in the micromass of soils was already observed by Kubiëna (1938), who considered it to be a characteristic of dispersed ('peptised') clay, in contrast to flocculated ('pectised') fine material with optically isotropic behaviour. Zones showing interference colours were called 'birefringent streaks' (Doppelbrechende Schlieren) by Kubiëna (1948), without making a distinction between parallel-oriented clay within the groundmass and as part of illuvial clay coatings. This approach was used till the 'plasmic fabric' concept of Brewer (1964a, 1964b) was introduced, until this was in turn replaced by the b-fabric concept (Bullock et al., 1985).

Optically anisotropic zones are caused by parallel arrangement of clay-sized plate-shaped phyllosilicate particles (e.g., Mitchell, 1956; Minashina, 1958; Stephen, 1960). Clay particles are small ( $<2\mu \mathrm{m}$  equivalent diameter) relative to the standard thickness of a thin section ( $20 - 30\mu \mathrm{m}$ ), resulting in superposition of many particles. If stacking of the individual particles is random, the effects of their optical properties on transmitted light will annihilate each other, resulting in a statistical isotropy. In zones where clay particles have a parallel arrangement, the contributions of individual particles will enhance each other and the zone will behave optically as a single crystal. In most cases, clay plates are organised in small aggregates of about  $20\mu \mathrm{m}$ , called 'domains' by Aylmore and Quirk (1959) and 'pseudocrystals' in Russian literature. Such domains display optical anisotropy, visible as small dots showing interference colours. Grim (1962) supposed this was due to 'form birefringence', caused by parallel alignment of crystals in a medium with a different refractive index, but this was later disproven (Morgenstern & Tchalenko, 1967a). Mitchell (1956) obtained domain size values of  $10 - 800\mu \mathrm{m}$  (mainly  $15 - 150\mu \mathrm{m}$ ) for various clays, both natural and remoulded.

Information about the submicroscopic fabric of the fine material of soils is scarce, although several studies were done on natural and remoulded clays in soil mechanics. TEM studies of microtome sections and replicas have demonstrated the presence of domains in red earths (Silva et al., 1965). A high degree of preferred orientation was proven for shear zones by TEM analysis by Foster and De (1971). Eswaran (1983) performed SEM studies of the fabric of the groundmass of various soils, concluding that it depends on mineralogical composition. Observations for a series of monomineralic micromass materials showed that (i) micromass materials composed of illite, chlorite or vermiculite comprise booklets with face-to-face arrangement, forming domains that can be stacked with a card-house fabric, (ii) kaolinite plates show subparallel packing, producing domains with parallel or card-house arrangement, (iii) smectitic material has a wavy appearance because of curling of particle edges, and it is characterised by face-to-face packing, with strong parallel orientation in slickensides, (iv) allophanic soils show a globular fabric consisting of spherical aggregates  $(5 - 500\mu \mathrm{m})$ , which also characterises allophane that encapsulates the other clay particles, and (v) halloysitic materials show a random arrangement of tubular particles. In the same study, oxic material is reported to display small aggregates consisting of very fine, randomly oriented kaolinite, except along

the sides of the aggregates, where kaolinite particles are parallel oriented. This is in agreement with TEM observations for ultrathin sections by Bresson (1981), showing both edge-to-edge and edge-to-face configurations for kaolinite particles  $(0.05 - 0.5\mu \mathrm{m})$  in feralitic soils.

In the descriptive system of Bullock et al. (1985) and Stoops (2003), five main types of b-fabric are considered, based on the presence or absence and patterns of crystals and domains showing interference colours (undifferentiated, crystallitic, speckled, striated, strial), partly with several subtypes. In an image analysis study of b-fabrics, not all types could be identified, although they were recognised visually, and the possibility that some observed b-fabric types are in fact an optical illusion was considered (Zaniewski, 2001; Zaniewski & van der Meer, 2005).

# 3.2.1 Undifferentiated b-Fabrics

The b-fabric of the micromass is considered as undifferentiated when no interference colours appear in XPL, using sufficiently high magnification and light intensity. The absence of interference colours can have different reasons: (i) absence of optically anisotropic fine material, (ii) absence of oriented platy or fibrous particles, and (iii) masking of interference colours by other substances.

Absence of optically anisotropic fine material - Undifferentiated b-fabrics have been described by many authors for soils on volcanic material, especially Andisols (see Stoops et al., 2018). These soils are characterised by a micromass consisting of nanocrystalline materials (allophane, imogolite). An undifferentiated b-fabric can also be observed for siliceous duricrusts, when the micromass is dominated by colloidal silica or opal (Gutiérrez-Castorena, 2018). It also characterises spodic materials dominated by Al and Fe colloids or by pure organic fine material, such as dopplerite and monomorphic fine organic material (see Van Ranst et al., 2018). Absence of oriented platy clay particles - As discussed before, random arrangement of platy clay particles results in apparent optical isotropy. Completely randomly arranged clay particles (flocculated) are exceptional in nature, occurring only along the sediment-water interface in certain recent deposits, especially at high salinity. Such deposits are commonly transformed to materials with parallel horizontal alignment of the clay particles upon burial (e.g., Moon, 1972). Randomly arranged clay is therefore not expected to be common in soils, unless external factors prohibit parallel orientation. The presence of large amounts of iron oxides or humic material is often considered to prevent alignment. A negative correlation between degree of clay particle alignment (birefringence ratio; see Section 5) and organic matter content was observed by Morgenstern and Tchalenko (1967a), who concluded that organic material hinders parallel clay orientation. In soils on volcanic ash, undifferentiated b-fabrics are observed for horizons dominated by halloysite, which is probably related to the tubular shape of halloysite particles (Eswaran, 1983).

Masking effect - In some cases an undifferentiated b-fabric is caused by the masking effect of the presence of other substances. This is most notably the case for Oxisols, due to the presence of abundant small hematite particles (Marcelino et al., 2018). This is clearly demonstrated by the appearance of weak striated b-fabrics following selective extraction of iron and manganese oxides in uncovered thin sections (Arocena et al., 1990; Stoops, 2003). Similarly, speckled and striated b-fabric can be recognised for iron-depletion features in oxic materials with undifferentiated b-fabric. In surface horizons, masking of interference colours by organic compounds may explain the presence of an undifferentiated b-fabric, but this has never been demonstrated.

# 3.2.2 Crystallitic b-Fabrics

By definition, a crystallitic b-fabric is caused by the abundant presence of small optically anisotropic particles. The components giving rise to this fabric are larger than clay size but smaller than the c/f limit that is used, otherwise the particles should be described as part of the coarse fraction.

The most common example is calcitic crystallitic b-fabrics, which occur mainly in soils of arid to subhumid regions (Durand et al., 2018). In most cases the calcite crystals are of pedogenic origin, but a detrital origin is common in soils on various types of sedimentary parent materials. The crystals almost always show a random distribution. In standard thin sections  $(20 - 30\mu \mathrm{m})$ , the crystals are often overlapping, but when the thickness of the section is reduced, the crystals can be observed as non-overlapping particles (see Stoops, 2003). Removal of calcite by acid treatment of uncovered thin sections can reveal a masked speckled or striated b-fabric (Wilding & Drees, 1990). Similar observations can be made for calcite depletion hypocoatings (e.g., Mees & Van Ranst, 2011; Mees, 2018).

Other examples include micaceous crystallitic b-fabrics, which can, for instance, be observed for young soils on marine clays. The relatively coarse mica particles may show various orientation patterns, described in the same way as for materials with striated b-fabrics. In bauxitic materials, gibbsiteic crystallitic b-fabrics are common (see Stoops & Marcelino, 2018), and quartzic crystallitic b-fabrics have been described for silcretes with chalcedony or non-fibrous microcrystalline quartz as micromass material (see Gutierrez-Castorena, 2018).

# 3.2.3 Speckled, Striated and Strial b-Fabrics

Speckled, striated and strial b-fabrics are the result of the presence of domains of parallel-arranged platy clay particles. Mitchell (1956), studying the influence of compaction on clay fabrics, and Morgenstern and Tchalenko (1967b), focussing on shear stress effects, were among the first to investigate experimentally the formation of zones with interference colours in clayey materials. Natural samples of sedimentary clay show greater amounts of randomly oriented particles than remoulded material, in which parallel orientations are more common (Mitchell, 1956). As soils can be considered as

materials remoulded repeatedly by pedoturbation processes (e.g., swelling-shrinking, bioturbation), domains of oriented clay can be expected to be omnipresent. Because dispersed clay (with parallel arrangement) always occupies a smaller volume than flocculated clay (with random orientation), the relative amount of oriented clay increases under pressure (Mitchell, 1956). Differences between dispersed and flocculated material are also expressed by b-fabrics of non-deformed material, as illustrated by strial b-fabrics obtained for clays settled in distilled water, in contrast to speckled b-fabrics that develop when phosphogypsum is added as flocculant (Southard et al., 1988).

# 3.2.3.1 Speckled b-Fabrics

When shear stress is weak relative to the shear strength of the material, no striated b-fabric will develop and a speckled b-fabric can be preserved. Speckled b-fabrics can therefore be dominant in soil materials that are not subjected to shrink-swell forces or in which vertical constraints are missing, as in surface horizons. The orientation of domains in materials with speckled b-fabrics has been identified as random (Hill, 1970) and shows a card-house arrangement, both before and after compaction (Bresson & Zambaux, 1990). Mosaic-speckled b-fabrics characterise the groundmass of soils and saprolites composed of relatively coarse clay aggregates without preferential orientation, which has been reported for materials dominated by minerals such as palygorskite (e.g., Stahr et al., 2000) and antigorite (e.g., Lambiv Dzemua et al., 2011).

# 3.2.3.2 Striated b-Fabrics

Striated b-fabrics are the result of parallel arrangement of clay domains (Brewer, 1964a, 1964b), forming striae. Clay particles are aligned parallel to planes of shearing in shear zones, but preferred orientation is also increased by compaction (Moon, 1972). As reviewed by Jim (1990), swelling pressure is exerted when the increase in volume is counteracted by lateral or vertical confinement. Stress develops when a difference in swelling exists between vertical and lateral directions. When this stress exceeds the shear strength of the soil, shear deformation occurs, which only takes place during the swelling stage. It results in two sets of shear planes at an angle of 45 degrees to the direction of the strain, reported as an angle of 35-55 degrees to the horizontal by Magaldi (1974). In thin sections, the apparent angle depends on the orientation of the section. With increasing bulk density of the material, the fabric is more strongly expressed (Jim, 1986). Using the method of Morgenstern and Tchalenko (1967a) to study remoulded Bt horizon material, Greene-Kelly and Mackney (1970) concluded that drying as such has no impact on the total degree of orientation within the micromass. The impact of earthquakes on clay arrangement in the micromass has been studied experimentally by Magaldi et al. (1994), showing only changes at submicroscopic level.

The nature of features related to shearing in soils was first studied using optical methods by Morgenstern and Tchalenko (1967b). An early TEM study, using ultrathin sections of experimentally deformed material, was performed by Foster and De (1971). They concluded that a high degree of preferred orientation occurs in shear-induced structures compared with the original material, and they observed that these striations

have irregular boundaries and variable width, despite their rather regular appearance when studied using optical microscopy.

Striated b-fabrics are most commonly recognised for soil materials with a single-spaced porphyric to fine monic c/f-related distribution pattern, subject to wetting and drying. They are especially well expressed in soil materials subjected to vertic or cryogenic processes (Kovda & Mermut, 2018; Van Vliet-Lanoë & Fox, 2018). Blokhuis et al. (1970) concluded that no simple relationship exists between b-fabric type and soil classification category for soils with vertic properties.

Porostriated b-fabrics - In natural soils, porostriated b-fabrics are commonly observed for vertic materials (Kovda & Mermut, 2018), in which they occur along accommodating planar voids that correspond to slickensides in the field. SEM images of slickensides clearly show parallel orientation of clay particles (Stoops & De Mets, 1970; Eswaran, 1983). A study by Hill (1970) yielded orientation diagrams demonstrating a close parallelism between the orientation of planar voids and that of domains in zones with porostriated b-fabric, in contrast to random orientations in the remaining micromass. Porostriated b-fabrics are also observed along root channels in clayey soils (Blevins et al., 1970; Stoops, 2003). These observations partly pertain to channels with roots in situ, suggesting that the clay became oriented by lateral pressure exerted by the growing root. Porostriated b-fabrics can be created as artefacts when cutting moist clay samples with a spade or knife, or by inserting a Kubiëna box in the clay, so care should be taken in recording clay orientation along sample edges.

Granostriated b-fabric - In conditions of isotropic stress, such as during swelling without confinement, no b-fabrics related to shearing can develop, but orientation of clay particles can still take place around coarse mineral grains, crystals and hard nodules (Dalrymple & Jim, 1984; Jim, 1986). The presence of granostriated b-fabrics in the absence of poro-, mono- or random striation therefore points to isotropic stress. Granostriated b-fabrics also form in the presence of shear stress, as confirmed by many descriptions of b-fabrics of vertic materials (see Kovda & Mermut, 2018). Blokhuis et al. (1970) observed that the thickness of the zone showing granostriation increases with increasing size of the surrounded coarse component. The presence of a granostriated b-fabric around a nodule indicates that the latter behaves as a hard body. Stoops (1972) suggested that granostriated b-fabrics can be one of the factors in the development of concentric Fe/Mn nodules, related to variations in permeability at a microscale and explaining why rather diffuse concentric nodules are common in Vertisols.

Mono-, parallel-, cross- and random striated b-fabrics - Monostriated b-fabrics are often observed as a prolongation of porostriated zones along planar voids, suggesting that they developed in part along pores that are now closed. Random striated b-fabrics form as a result of several successive periods of shearing, which is characteristic of most vertic materials, unless masked by a calcitic crystallitic b-fabric. It

is, however, not restricted to materials meeting the requirements for vertic properties in the main soil classification systems. In clayey soils with ustic or xeric moisture regimes, striated b-fabrics are often formed by shear deformation of illuvial clay coatings, which also resulted in closure of the pores along which they were deposited (see Kuhn et al., 2018). Striated b-fabrics are also recognised for landslide deposits (see Mücher et al., 2018).

Circular and concentric striated b-fabrics - Circular striated b-fabrics are relatively rarely observed. One of the best illustrated cases is that of oxic materials (Marcelino et al., 2018), in which weak striation occurs around granules with undifferentiated b-fabric. Similar patterns have been recognised in SEM studies (Eswaran, 1983). In soil materials studied after removal of easily dispersible clay, circular striated b-fabrics are not anymore present (Embrechts & Stoops, 1987). Circular striated b-fabrics have also been observed for Vertisols (Field et al., 1997), as well as for thixotropic clay (Stoops, unpublished data). Bresson (1981) observed similar concentric fabrics for illitic clays, at a submicroscopic scale.

Crescent striated  $b$ -fabric - Crescent b-fabrics have often been observed for clayey tropical soils (Stoops, 2003; see also Marcelino et al., 2018), and they have also been reported for polder soils (Miedema, pers. comm.). They might be generated by small worms, such as nematodes.

Strial b-fabrics - Strial b-fabrics are typically inherited from clayey parent materials, deposited in calm conditions with good dispersion. The same fabric can also characterise saprolites derived from mudstones or shales. The only pedogenic occurrence of materials with strial b-fabrics are surface crusts (Williams et al., 2018). The presence of a strial b-fabric points to the absence of pedoturbation. Magaldi (1987) showed that the strial fabric of recent lake deposits was totally obliterated over a period of 100 years of soil development.

# 3.2.3.3 Comparative b-Fabric Studies

The type and development of b-fabrics is an essential criterion in several indexes created to measure the stage of soil development based on micromorphology (e.g., Dorronsoro, 1994; Magaldi & Tallini, 2000; Khormali et al., 2003). This was already implied by Cagauan and Uehara (1965), who suggested that strongly weathered tropical soils with an undifferentiated b-fabric are less fertile than those whose micromass shows interference colours. For B horizons of soils representing various stages of soil development on basalt in a tropical region, Eswaran (1972) recognised a trend in b-fabric expression. The speckled b-fabric that is observed for Entisols evolves to striated, with a maximum expression in Inceptisols, and gradually declines again to speckled in Ultisols, next becoming undifferentiated in Oxisols.

In another type of comparative b-fabric studies, Zainol and Stoops (1986) found that a relationship exists between the development of optical anisotropic domains and the plasticity index of soil material (Table 4). A relationship between soil plasticity and the development of clay orientation had earlier been observed by Brewer and Blackmore

Table 4 Relationship between plasticity index, b-fabric and soil type

After Zainol & Stoops (1986).

(1976), but these authors did not make a distinction between striated b-fabrics and illuvial clay coatings. A strong linear relationship between plasticity index and degree of b-fabric development, determined by point counting of domains of oriented clay, was recognised by Embrechts and Stoops (1987), for a soil sequence with ferralitic weathering. In the same study, materials with undifferentiated b-fabric were found to have a lower content of dispersible clay than those with other b-fabrics, which is probably related to a lack of parallel arrangement of the non-dispersable clay.

Overall, pedoplasmation and pedoturbation are important factors affecting b-fabrics (see Stoops & Schaefer, 2018).

# 4. Orientation and Distribution Patterns in the Groundmass

# 4.1 Basic Orientation and Distribution

In most soil materials, the basic and referred orientation and distribution patterns of groundmass constituents are random. If not, they can provide information about the nature of the rock substrate from which the soil is derived, as well as about geomorphological and pedogenic processes.

The arrangement of residual quartz grains in strongly weathered saprolites may help to distinguish between granite, gneiss or quartzite as original material. Another example are clusters of oriented orthoclase grains as remnants of perthitic intergrowths, from which the albite component has been removed through weathering (see Fig. 6A and B).

A banded distribution pattern can be observed for soils on sedimentary parent materials, or on derived saprolites, that have not yet been affected by pedoturbation. Sorting and layering are also observed for laminated colluvium (Mücher et al., 2018). Korina and Faustova (1964) published polar diagrams that clearly demonstrate preferred orientations of quartz and feldspar grains in moraine deposits, related to the glacier flow. Using the same methods, Hill (1981) and Sen and Mukherjee (1972) reconstructed the flow direction of fluvoglacial parent materials. A preferred oblique orientation of elongate grains occurs in solifluction deposits (Mücher et al., 2018).

Lafeber (1972), using polar diagrams for measurements obtained for horizontal thin sections, reported an orientation of platy particles that is parallel to the strike of the terrain slope and an orientation of elongated grains that is parallel to the dip of the slope.

Parallel arrangements of platy particles have also been observed for litter layers, surface crusts (Williams et al., 2018), frost-affected materials (Van Vliet-Lanoë & Fox, 2018), and surfaces affected by trampling (Rentzel et al., 2017).

Crescent arrangements, corresponding to passage features that are not sufficiently pore-related to qualify as infillings, were described for soils with vermic characteristics (e.g., Kooistra & Pulleman, 2018), for termite nests (Stoops, 1964), and for gypsic horizons (Barzanji & Stoops, 1974; Poch et al., 2018).

# 4.2 Related Distribution Between Coarse and Fine Particles

The mutual relation between coarse and fine components has been considered since the early days of soil micromorphology as an important soil characteristic. Kubiëna (1938) was the first to distinguish several types of arrangements, named 'elementary fabrics', whose definitions also take into account the state of the fine material (dispersed vs. flocculated). Brewer (1960, 1964b) distinguished four types of related distributions for plasma and skeleton grains (agglomeroplasmic, granular, intertextic, porphyroskelic), which was later replaced by the c/f-related distribution concept (Stoops & Jongerius, 1975; Bullock et al., 1985; Stoops, 2003). A system proposed by Eswaran and Baños (1976) comprises elements of microstructure, and so does the system proposed by Brewer and Pawluk (1975), Brewer (1979) and Brewer and Sleeman (1988). An overview of these systems is given by Jim (1988a). A different emphasis is used in sediment petrography, in which a distinction is mainly made between grain-supported and matrix-supported fabrics.

The c/f-related distribution pattern of the groundmass depends largely on clay content, with for instance porphyric patterns restricted to materials with high clay content, but silt/sand ratio also plays a role, especially for soils with intermediate clay contents (Dalrymple & Jim, 1984). The type of c/f-related distribution pattern can also be influenced by the type of cohesive forces (covalent vs ionic bonds) between the constituents (Chadwick & Nettleton, 1990). An overview of the occurrence of c/f-related distribution patterns in various materials is given elsewhere (Stoops et al., 2018).

In a study of changes in c/f-related distribution patterns and soil volume during soil development, Chadwick and Nettleton (1994) recognise a general evolution from coarse monic, over gefuric, chitonic or enaulic, to porphyric and finally open porphyric, whereby the increase in fine material is due either to weathering or to external input.

Enaulic c/f-related distribution patterns are particularly common in surface horizons and dominant in horizons with high organic matter contents, except when dominated by monomorphic fine material. In young soils, c/f-related distribution patterns may be the only micromorphological feature whose nature varies between different horizons or profiles (e.g., Stoops et al., 2001).

Chitonic c/f-related distribution patterns occur commonly in sandy soils when suspended matter settles on and around grains, as is the case in incipient spodic or cambic horizons. This type of c/f-related distribution pattern was obtained experimentally by Brewer and Haldane (1957) using clay suspensions in sand columns. When development

increases, a combination of chitonic and gefuric is created. Not all occurrences of chitonic c/f-related distribution patterns should be attributed to illuviation, because the surface of detrital sand grains is commonly covered by very thin clay coatings, which can be continuous or discontinuous. This is prominently observed for deposits such as reddish dune sands.

# 5. Quantitative Analysis of the Groundmass

Two quantitative aspects of groundmass material can be determined: (i) abundance of components and fabrics, expressed as numbers per surface unit or as area or volume percentages, and (ii) orientation of grains and fabrics. Quantitative data for groundmass constituents have mainly been obtained as a by-product of the quantification of pedofeatures and porosity, yielding information about c/f ratio, composition of the coarse fraction and the relative proportion of groundmass, pedofeatures and voids. Almost all published results were obtained through point counting. For quantification of the orientation of groundmass constituents, several attempts have been made to replace manual methods by image analysis techniques (e.g., Tovey et al., 1990, 1992a, 1992b; Tovey & Sokolov, 1997; Tovey & Wang, 1997). The older literature on this subject has been reviewed by Tovey (1974).

# 5.1 Coarse Fraction

Besides applying point counting, it has been tried by some authors to obtain quantitative data for the mineralogical composition of the coarse fraction through image analysis (e.g., Terribile & FitzPatrick, 1992, 1995; Terribile et al., 1997), but this approach is not yet clearly applicable for soils with complex mineral and rock fragment assemblages. The use of SEM-EDS mapping could be a solution, but its use is limited by the small field observed with SEM, the complexity of rock fragments, and the lack of direct mineralogical information.

Quantification of the orientation of coarse groundmass components is most easily achieved by determining the orientation of two-dimensional cross sections of plate-shaped (e.g., mica) or elongated (e.g., hornblende) particles within the plane of the thin section, which is done by rotating the graduated microscope stage and plotting the angle between the longitudinal axis and a reference point on a rosette or rose diagram (e.g., Hill, 1970). A more correct but complex method is measuring the orientation, in three dimensions, of the optical axes of mineral grains (e.g., quartz, feldspar, mica), making use of a universal stage (Fyodorov stage), and plotting them in stereographic projection (polar diagram). This second technique, commonly used in petrographical studies of metamorphic rocks, requires a good knowledge of optical mineralogy and stereographic projection theories (Lafeber, 1964, 1967, 1972). Examples of studies of this type for soil-related materials include the work of Korina and Faustova (1964) on moraine deposits, and that of Sen and Mukherjee (1972) and Hill (1981) on fluvoglacial sediments.

# 5.2 b-Fabric

Quantification of the b-fabric is a relatively difficult issue because many factors play a role. The basic orientation already has several components, including domain size, abundance (or occupied area), intensity, and birefringence. The referred orientation deals with the orientation of individual domains with respect to a reference feature, such as a void, a grain, or a horizontal or vertical line. For determination of relative area, expressed as percentage of the total micromass, the occurrence of extinction every 90 degrees when the microscope stage is turned is an additional problem. This can be overcome by the use of circular polarised light (see Stoops, 2003). The thickness of the thin section and the type of light source are important factors, making comparison between studies questionable. Photometric or image analysis methods for b-fabric quantification were developed by Jim (1988b), Zaniewski (2001) and Zaniewski and van der Meer (2005).

Quantitative analyses of b-fabrics have been performed since several decades, initially as part of studies in soil mechanics (Mitchell, 1956; Morgenstern et al., 1967) and later also by soil micromorphologists.

To determine the total degree of orientation of a given zone, Morgenstern and Tchalenko (1967a) proposed to use the ratio between minimum and maximum light intensity in XPL when the microscope stage is rotated ('birefringence ratio',  $\beta$ ), measured with a photometer that is installed on the microscope. In this study, several classes were distinguished:  $\beta = 1.0$  (random orientation),  $< 1.0 - 0.9$  (slight orientation),  $< 0.9 - 0.5$  (medium orientation),  $< 0.5$  (strong orientation) and 0.0 (perfect orientation). Applying this method for remoulded Bt horizons, Greene-Kelly and Mackney (1970) studied the impact of drying on the micromass.

Point counting of birefringent domains has often been used as an adequate method to determine their frequency, as done, for instance, by Mitchell (1956) in soil mechanics, and later also in soil micromorphology by Brewer and Blackmore (1976), Zainol and Stoops (1986) and Embrechts and Stoops (1987).

Stoops and Eswaran (1973) proposed a method using circular polarised light and a photometric cell mounted on a microscope, showing a clear difference between studied soil types. Overall, results are too much influenced by the light source and thin section thickness to allow comparison between results of different analysts.

The orientation pattern of domains can be measured by determining, for each individual domain, the extinction angle relative to a reference (e.g., soil surface, void wall), by rotating the microscope. A sufficient number of domains should be measured (e.g., 100, as proposed by Hill, 1970), and the results should be plotted on a rosette or rose diagram. As only orientations and no directions are measured, the upper part of the diagram is sufficient, the lower part being its mirror image. Analysis of the orientation of domains is generally hindered by a lack of information about orientation of the thin section relative to field conditions, for instance with regard to slope. Comparison between horizontal and vertical sections should be useful, but this has apparently not yet been performed.

# 6. Discussion and Conclusions

Although little attention has been given to the groundmass in reviews of micromorphological characteristics, important information is scattered over many publications in the fields of pedology, sedimentology and soil mechanics. Several systems for quantitative analysis of area and/or orientation of fabric components, including photometric and image analysing systems, have been proposed, but results of such analyses have only rarely been published.

Analysis of the coarse fraction requires a certain degree of knowledge of mineralogy, petrography and optical techniques, which is sometimes missing among users of soil thin sections (Shahack-Gross, 2015). This is also the case for the interpretation of alteration, for which a good knowledge of chemical reactions and balances is required. For some minerals, such as olivines, pyroxenes and feldspars, much information is available on their alteration, whereas for others, such as epidotes and amphiboles, information is limited.

The behaviour of the clay mass under stress is one of the fields in which much experimental work has been done, including optical and SEM studies. Nevertheless, several interpretations of b-fabrics were actually never proven and merit more attention.

Few attempts have been made to explain the genesis of some c/f-related distribution patterns, and more study is necessary.

- Occurrence in soils - in weakly to moderately weathered material  
- Alteration - reviewed by Bisdom et al. (1982); some inclusions weather more easily than the biotite host, leaving dissolution cavities (Ghabru et al., 1987)  
- Non-pedogenic and pedogenic alteration to chlorite – deuteric alteration with pellicular pattern; pedogenic alteration affecting the whole crystal (De Coninck et al., 1987; Stoops & Dedecker, 2006) (Fig. 1C and D)  
- Non-pedogenic and pedogenic alteration to vermiculite or interstratified phyllosilicates - decrease in colour, pleochroism and relief, lowering of interference colours, disappearance of 'bird's-eye effect' (Fig. 1E and F); common subsequent alteration to kaolinite  
- Pedogenic alteration to kaolinite (less commonly hydrothermal) – wedge-shaped penetration of kaolinite between biotite lamellae, causing exfoliation, resulting first in sheaf-like aspect, commonly with goethite formation along contact with soil micromass (Penven et al., 1981; Taboada & García, 1999a), kaolinite oriented either parallel (e.g., Wilson, 1966) or perpendicular (e.g., Seddoh & Robert, 1972) to the cleavage direction of the biotite host (SEM); expansion advances towards the centre, which can continue until a kaolinite booklet has formed, much thicker than the original biotite grain (up to  $250\%$ ; Delvigne, 1998) (Fig. 2A and B); in well-drained tropical saprolites, associated goethite or hematite aggregates, especially along the sides of the pseudomorphs (Curmi & Maurice, 1981); kaolinite alter-omorphs are quickly destroyed in the soil by pedoplasmation

- Occurrence in soils - non-pedogenic calcite as common inherited phase in soils of semiarid to arid regions, or in young soils on calcareous substrates; also as anthropogenic additions, including liming material; common as pedogenic phase (see Durand et al., 2018)  
- Alteration - easily dissolved, especially at low pH; pellicular pattern of congruent dissolution, which may result in denticulate residues surrounded by void space; corrosion patterns (SEM) related to environmental conditions (Delmas & Berrier, 1987)

- Occurrence in soils - only in weakly weathered material; pedogenic chlorites are typically not observed in thin sections because of their fine grain size  
- Pedogenic alteration - pellicular pattern, or along cleavage planes, characterised by a decrease in pleochroism and an increase in interference colours when transformed to vermiculite, smectite or interstratified phyllosilicates (Anand & Gilkes, 1984a; De Coninck et al., 1987) (Fig. 2C and D)

along cracks, resulting in boxwork system, followed by congruent dissolution of garnet residues, leaving cells that become filled with fine-grained goethite and less commonly with gibbsite (e.g., Embrechts & Stoops, 1982; Parisot et al., 1983; Velbel, 1984) (Fig. 3B); near the soil surface, the goethite pseudomorphs may be transformed to hematite or become physically degraded; the internal fabric of iron oxide pseudomorphs can be preserved during colluvial or alluvial transport, allowing detection of the former presence of garnet in source rocks of reworked material (Fig. 3C); cracks in garnet crystals can also be filled with authigenic phyllosilicates (Bouchard et al., 1995); in saprolites on specific manganese ore deposits, spessartine is altered to lithiophorite and next to cryptomelane, in the form of pseudomorphic replacement (Grandin & Perseil, 1977; Beauvais & Nahon, 1985)  
- Pedogenic alteration in soils - alteration to microcrystalline goethite alteromorphs without visible boxwork fabric; complete replacement by kaolinite in tropical soils (Muggler et al., 2007)

# Glaconite  $(\mathrm{K}, \mathrm{Na})(\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}, \mathrm{Al}, \mathrm{Mg})_{2}(\mathrm{Si}, \mathrm{Al})_{4} \mathrm{O}_{10}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}$

- Optical characteristics - green to yellowish green, pleochroic, low to moderate relief, as aggregates with xenotopic or fibrous fabric (mosaic-speckled b-fabric); first- to second-order interference colours, masked by mineral colour

- Occurrence in soils - mainly in weakly weathered soil materials derived from sandy marine deposits  
- Pedogenic alteration - physical alteration can transform glauconite pellets to a green micromass (De Coninck & Laruelle, 1964; Skiba et al., 2014) (Fig. 3D); chemical alteration initially produces pellicular patterns (formation of brownish iron oxides, related to oxidation of  $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ ), gradually affecting the entire grain (Fig. 3E and F), with gradual glauconite transformation to smectitic clay (Van Ranst & De Coninck, 1983; Skiba et al., 2014)

# Hornblende

- Main members - magnesiohornblende  $\left(\mathrm{Ca}_{2}\left(\mathrm{Mg}_{4} \mathrm{Al}\right) \left(\mathrm{Si}_{7} \mathrm{Al}\right) \mathrm{O}_{22}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}\right)$ , ferrohornblende  $\left(\mathrm{Ca}_{2}\left(\mathrm{Fe}_{4}^{2+} \mathrm{Al}\right) \left(\mathrm{Si}_{7} \mathrm{Al}\right) \mathrm{O}_{22}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}\right)$

- Occurrence in soils - in weakly to moderately weathered material  
- Non-pedogenic alteration - deuteric alteration to talc, chlorite, epidote, calcite and quartz  
- Pedogenic alteration - congruent dissolution, with parallel or cross-linear patterns (parallel to cleavage), combined with pellicular patterns for isolated grains, with denticulate aspect of unaltered remnants (Anand & Gilkes, 1984a) (Fig. 4A and B); in initial phase, associated smectite formation in cracks, producing a boxwork pattern (Fig. 4C and D) (Verheye & Stoops, 1975)

# Ilmenite  $(\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\mathrm{Ti}^{4+}\mathrm{O}_3)$

- Optical characteristics - opaque, platy or anhedral; black metallic lustre in OIL

# Magnetite  $(\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\mathrm{Fe}_2^{3+}\mathrm{O}_4)$

- Optical characteristics - opaque, commonly octahedral (rectangular or triangular cross sections), also clustered irregular grains, grey metallic lustre in OIL  
- Occurrence in rocks – in magmatic rocks as accessory mineral, most abundant in gabbro/basalt and related rocks; in metamorphic rocks; in sedimentary rocks, locally as placer deposit  
- Occurrence in soils – highly stable and therefore common in all soils, concentrated in strongly weathered soils; may occur as the only inherited phase following weathering of volcanic ash (Stoops, 2013; Stoops et al., 2018)  
- Deuteric alteration - common deuteric alteration to hematite pseudomorphs (martite)  
- Pedogenic alteration – in soils, slow transformation to ferrihydrite or goethite; in laterites, pellicular and linear alteration to porous hematite pseudomorphs, partly with characteristic lamellar martite fabric (Anand & Gilkes, 1984b)

# Microcline (K(AlSi $_3$ O $_8$ ))

- Optical characteristics – colourless, low negative relief, mainly equant grains, perfect cleavage in one direction, imperfect in others; first-order grey interference colours, typical polysynthetic twinning in two perpendicular directions (Fig. 4E)  
- Occurrence in rocks – in saturated leucocratic magmatic rocks (e.g., granite, granodiorite, syenite), especially in pegmatites; in some metamorphic rocks (gneiss); also in derived sedimentary rocks

- Occurrence in soils - relatively stable  
- Alteration - pellicular and cavernous patterns (Fig. 4F); tubular weathering has been observed for microcline in Podzols (Jongmans et al., 1997)

# Muscovite (KAl $_2$ Si $_3$ Al)O $_{10}$ (OH) $_2$

- Optical characteristics - colourless, low to medium relief; plate-shaped crystals, clear cleavage parallel to plate faces; upper second-order interference colours, extinction parallel to cleavage, length slow for cross sections perpendicular to plates  
- Occurrence in rocks — abundant in granitoid rocks (random orientation), micaschists and gneisses (parallel orientation); common in certain sedimentary rocks, oriented parallel to bedding; fine-grained muscovite (and/or paragonite), called sericite, occurs as non-pedogenic alteration product of alkali feldspar (sericitisation)  
- Occurrence in soils – because of its resistance to weathering, concentrated in strongly weathered soils and therefore allowed for oxic horizon criteria (Soil Survey Staff, 2014)  
- Alteration - physical alteration by separation of lamellae (Pinto et al., 2015) or by interlamellar crystallisation of authigenic minerals (e.g., salt minerals, gibbsite)

# Olivine

- Main members - forsterite  $(\mathrm{Mg}_2(\mathrm{SiO}_4))$ , fayalite  $(\mathrm{Fe}_2^{2+}(\mathrm{SiO}_4))$  
- Optical characteristics - colourless, pale green (forsterite) or yellowish brown (fayalite), weak pleochroism, medium to strong relief, equant crystals, no distinct cleavage; second- to third-order interference colours (Fig. 5A and B); glass inclusions point to volcanic origin  
- Occurrence in rocks - in undersaturated magmatic rocks, including occurrences as a dominant (xenotopic) constituent of mafic and ultramafic intrusive rocks (e.g., peridotite, dunite, harzburgite), also as (euhedral) phenocrysts in dolerites and basalts, often with zoning (Mg-rich in the centre, Fe-rich at the border); in metamorphic rocks, derived from dolomite-bearing rocks (forsterite); in sedimentary rocks, locally as placer deposit  
- Occurrence in soils - in young or poorly weathered material on olivine-bearing rocks, including some serpentineites  
- Alteration – see Delvigne et al. (1979) and Delvigne (1998); highly weatherable (cf. Goldich, 1938), but because of the lack of cleavage, it may be more stable in soils than augite (Stoops, 2013); pellicular and irregular linear alteration patterns  
- Alteration to serpentine – common hydrothermal alteration to serpentine or talc in undersaturated rocks, often with exsolution of magnetite crystallites, producing serpentinites from which unaltered olivine remains may be liberated to form part of the coarse fraction of derived soils; serpentine development can be followed byIDDINGSITISATION of the remaining olivine, leaving serpentine unaffected

- Alteration to 'chlorophaeite' (chlorite-related amorphous material) – deuteric alteration, leaving denticulate residues (Delvigne, 1998)  
- Alteration to 'iddingsite' (mixture of cryptocrystalline goethite and phyllosilicates, such as smectite, chlorite and talc) – common product of deuteric alteration, advancing inward from the sides along cracks (in intrusive magmatic rocks), or with pellicular patterns (in volcanic rocks) (Fig. 5C and D) (Delvigne et al., 1979), in both cases yielding partly denticulate remnants; can be followed by further olivine alteration with associated zeolite formation (Delvigne, 1998); IDDingsite pseudomorphs are characterised by yellow to reddish brown colours, weak to distinct pleochroism, masked second- to third-order interference colours, optical single-crystal behaviour, with same extinction position as the olivine host, sharp to gradual boundaries, in contrast to goethite pseudomorphs; IDDingsite rims can be covered by olivine, pointing to late-magmatic IDDingsite formation (Sheppard, 1962; Ildefense, 1983); common alteration of olivine residues to other minerals within the IDDingsite pseudomorph; pedogenic alteration to IDDingsite is not excluded, but as yet not proven; in soil conditions, IDDingsite rims can protect the remaining olivine from pedogenic alteration; occasionally as only coarse component of soils on strongly weathered pyroclastic deposits (Stoops, 2013) (Fig. 5E and F)  
- Alteration to chlorite - common pellicular or irregular linear late-magmatic alteration to chlorite in Mg-rich basic or ultramafic intrusive rocks; initially along cracks, forming coatings composed of chlorite plates oriented perpendicular to the sides, followed by development of sawtooth patterns as chlorite orientation becomes controlled by that of the olivine host, ultimately resulting in development of a complete pseudomorph (Baker & Haggerty, 1967); these alteromorphs evolve to more brownish aggregates through alteration and are easily destroyed by pedoplasmation  
- Alteration to 'bowlingite' (green material with variable composition, mainly Mg smectites and Mg chlorites) – formed during final cooling stages of magma and in early stages of saprolite development; alteration along cracks, with partially radial fabric of the bowlingite deposits; possible alteration of bowlingite and olivine remains toIDDingsite or goethite in higher parts of saprolite profiles (Eggleton et al., 1987); alteromorphs destroyed by pedoplasmaton  
- Alteration to nontronite and beidellite – in conditions with limited leaching, common pedogenic alteration to nontronite and beidellite (see Delvigne et al., 1979; Ildefense, 1983; Delvigne & Stoops, 1990); formation of iron-rich smectite coatings along cracks, with smectite plates oriented perpendicular to the sides, leaving isolated remnants that can be altered to produce aggregates of randomly or radially oriented smectite; smectite alteromorphs changing to brown by goethite formation in higher parts of saprolite profiles, ultimately destroyed by pedoplasmation  
- Alteration to iron oxides – in well-drained conditions in humid tropical environments, common pedogenic alteration to goethite, along fractures, producing box-work patterns, with olivine remnants that undergo congruent dissolution, resulting

in an open boxwork system; rare preferential arrangement, with extinction parallel to the c-axis of olivine; in less well-drained conditions, cells of the boxwork system are initially filled with yellowish amorphous material, which is subsequently dissolved

# Orthoclase  $(\mathrm{K}(\mathrm{AlSi}_3\mathrm{O}_8))$

- Optical characteristics - colourless, often cloudy, low negative relief, perfect cleavage in one direction, less perfect in the others; first-order grey interference colours, simple Carlsbad twinning; can occur as part of exsolution features composed of orthoclase and albite lamellae (perthite, antiperthite)  
- Occurrence in rocks - in saturated intrusive rocks (e.g., granite)  
- Occurrence in soils – almost absent in strongly weathered material but more stable than plagioclase, pyroxenes and amphiboles in soil environments (Taboada & García, 1999a, 1999b)  
- Pedogenic alteration - along fractures, and with cross-linear patterns related to cleavage and twinning directions, followed by cavernous alteration (Delvigne et al., 1987); replaced by gibbsite in conditions with strong leaching; upon alteration of perthite or antiperthite, albite will disappear first, leaving a set of parallel orthoclase lamellae separated by weathering products (Fig. 6A and B)

# Plagioclase

- Main members - albite  $\left(\mathrm{Na}(\mathrm{AlSi}_3\mathrm{O}_8)\right)$ , anorthite  $\left(\mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{Al}_2\mathrm{Si}_2\mathrm{O}_8)\right)$ , informal names such as oligoclase, andesine, labradorite and bytownite for intermediate compositions  
- Optical characteristics - colourless, weak negative (albite) to weak positive (anorthite) relief, more or less equidimensional in intrusive magmatic rocks, lath-shaped in volcanic rocks (e.g., basalt, andesite) (see Fig. 5A and E); first-order grey interference colours; polysynthetic twinning (alternating light and dark parallel lamellae); in magmatic rocks, common zonation with anorthite-rich core and albite-rich rim, which influences weathering patterns (Taboada & García, 1999a, 1999b) (Fig. 6C and D)  
- Occurrence in rocks - in almost all magmatic rocks, ranging from oversaturated to granitic; in micaschist and gneiss; in arkosic sedimentary rocks  
- Occurrence in soils - common in young soils, almost absent in strongly weathered material  
- Alteration - anorthite-rich plagioclase is more easily altered than albite-rich occurrences, which can be expressed by alteration of the Ca-rich core of zoned crystals; pellicular alteration mostly combined with alteration along fissures parallel to twinning planes  
- Non-pedogenic alteration – forms of deuteric alteration include alteration to fine-grained muscovite or paragonite within plagioclase crystals (seriticisation),

alteration to (clino)zoisite or epidote with granular aspect (saussuritisation) (see Fig. 3A), alteration to zeolites in the form of crystals with irregular shapes and distribution patterns within the plagioclase (Delvigne, 1998), and alteration to kaolinite, resulting in cloudy limpidity

- Pedogenic alteration - linear or banded, along with intersecting cleavage planes; in conditions with limited leaching, formation of amorphous colloids (Delvigne & Martin, 1970), which can evolve to halloysite (Eswaran & Wong Chaw Bin, 1978; Anand & Gilkes, 1984a), kaolinite or gibbsite (Gilkes et al., 1980) (Fig. 6E and F), depending on leaching conditions (Delvigne, 1965; Eswaran, 1979), whereby the newly formed clay domains show simultaneous extinction, without optical continuity with the plagioclase host (Cremeens et al., 1990), or perpendicular to fracture walls (Stoops & Dedecker, 2006); in conditions with strong leaching, gibbsite is formed directly, often resulting in complete alteromorphs; in arid soils, physical alteration can take place through growth of calcite in cracks (Stoops, 2003)

# Quartz  $(\mathrm{SiO}_2)$

- Optical characteristics – colourless, very weak positive or negative relief, depending on impregnation medium; first-order grey interference colours, partly with wavy extinction and then biaxial; quartz of different origins can be distinguished by cathodoluminescence (blue violet for magmatic rocks, brown for metamorphic rocks, greenish brown for hydrothermal deposits) (Marshall, 1988)  
- Occurrence in rocks - most common mineral in saturated intrusive magmatic rocks and metamorphic rocks, and in derived sedimentary rocks; rare in volcanic rocks; nearly absent in undersaturated and mafic to ultramafic magmatic rocks; microcrystalline quartz, partly with fibrous morphology (chalcedony), as a principal component of chert; cristobalite and tridymite are high-temperature  $\mathrm{SiO}_2$  polymorphs, occurring in cavities of rapidly cooled volcanic rocks (e.g., obsidian)  
- Occurrence in soils – the most common mineral of the coarse fraction of most soils, and practically the only main mineral surviving strong weathering (e.g., in ferralitic soils); quartz grains are often composed of two or more crystals (fragments of rocks such as granite, gneiss and quartzite); wavy extinction points in most cases to metamorphic origin; for pedogenic quartz, see review by Gutierrez-Castorena (2018)  
- Alteration - fracturation caused by release of internal stress or by pressure of surrounding weathering minerals (Power et al., 1990); as no distinct cleavage is present, congruent dissolution of quartz follows a pellicular or irregular linear pattern; in ferralitic soils and lateritic materials, the irregular cracks are often filled with fine-grained hematite or gibbsite, resulting in 'runiquartz' development (Eswaran et al., 1975; Marcelino et al., 2018; Stoops & Marcelino, 2018); SEM studies of the surface of quartz grains can provide relevant information about the origin of the grains (e.g., Huang et al., 1990) or about degree and type of weathering (e.g., Marcelino & Stoops, 1996; Marcelino et al., 1999; Degórski & Kowalkowski, 2011)

# Sanidine  $(\mathsf{K}(\mathsf{AlSi}_3\mathsf{O}_8))$

- Optical characteristics - colourless, low negative relief, perfect cleavage in one direction, less perfect in the others; first-order grey interference colours, no twinning.  
- Occurrence in rocks - in saturated volcanic rocks  
- Occurrence in soils - only in soils on volcanic material, almost absent in strongly weathered material  
- Alteration - no available data

# Serpentine

- Main members - antigorite  $\left(\mathrm{Mg}_{3} \mathrm{Si}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{5}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}\right)$ , chrysotile  $\left(\mathrm{Mg}_{3} \mathrm{Si}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{5}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}\right)$  
- Optical characteristics - colourless to pale green, then weakly pleochroic, low positive relief, anhedral to fibrous (microcrystalline); first-order grey to yellow interference colours, parallel extinction, length slow  
- Occurrence in rocks - principal constituent of serpentine; low-temperature metamorphic or hydrothermal alteration product of olivine or Mg pyroxenes in saturated and ultramafic rocks (e.g., peridotite)  
- Occurrence in soils - only as part of rock fragments in young soils on serpentine, or in lower parts of saprolite profiles  
- Alteration - no micromorphological descriptions are available; probably congruent dissolution

# Tourmaline

- Main members - dravite (NaMg₃Al₆(Si₆O₁₈) (BO₃)₃(OH)₃(OH)), elbaite (Na(Al₁.5Li₁.5)Al₆(Si₆O₁₈)(BO₃)₃(OH)₃(OH)), schorl (NaFe₃²⁺Al₆(Si₆O₁₈)(BO₃)₃(OH)₃(OH))  
- Optical characteristics – grey, brown, green, blue, with strong pleochroism, prismatic, no cleavage; second- to third-order interference colours, generally masked by mineral colour, parallel extinction, length fast  
- Occurrence in rocks – in intrusive magmatic rocks (pegmatites) and certain metamorphic rocks (micaschist, gneiss), as accessory mineral; very common as minor component in sands and sandstones, because of its high stability  
- Occurrence in soils - commonly concentrated in strongly weathered material (e.g., oxic)  
- Alteration - one of the most stable minerals, both chemically and physically; no evidence of alteration at microscopic scale

# Tremolite-Actinolite

- Main members - tremolite  $\left(\mathrm{Ca}_{2}\left(\mathrm{Mg}_{5.0\text{-}4.5}\mathrm{Fe}_{0.0\text{-}0.5}{}^{2+}\right) \mathrm{Si}_{8} \mathrm{O}_{22}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}\right)$ , actinolite  $\left(\mathrm{Ca}_{2}\left(\mathrm{Mg}_{4.5\text{-}2.5} \mathrm{Fe}_{0.5\text{-}2.5}{}^{2+}\right) \mathrm{Si}_{8} \mathrm{O}_{22}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}\right)$

- Optical characteristics - colourless (tremolite) to green (actinolite), weak pleochroism, prismatic habit, high positive relief, distinct cleavage parallel to c-axis, crossing at 60/120-degree angles in cross sections perpendicular to the c-axis; first- to second-order interference colours, oblique extinction (10-20 degrees), length slow  
- Occurrence in rocks - common in metamorphic rocks (e.g., gneiss, greenschist facies rocks), generally associated with calcite  
- Occurrence in soils - in weakly to moderately weathered material  
- Non-pedogenic alteration - late-magmatic and deuteric alteration to other amphiboles (uralitisation) or to antigorite or talc with associated magnetite  
- Pedogenic alteration – pellicular, and advancing inward from the sides along cracks rather than along cleavage planes; formation of amorphous material, followed by smectite with parallel orientation, replaced by kaolinite in conditions with strong leaching (Delvigne, 1983); alteration of actinolite to vermiculite along fractures and cleavage planes, forming pseudomorphic large single crystals (Abreu & Vairinho, 1990); in conditions with strong leaching, formation of iron oxides along fractures, leaving denticulate residues, which can be separated from the iron oxide deposits by voids

# Zircon  $(\mathrm{Zr}(\mathrm{SiO}_4))$

- Optical characteristics - colourless, extreme positive relief, short prismatic crystals with pyramidal terminations, elliptic when transported, no clear cleavage; third-order interference colours, straight extinction, length slow (Fig. 7A and B)  
- Occurrence in rocks - as accessory mineral in many intrusive magmatic rocks (e.g., granites, diorites, syenites); in sedimentary rocks, as almost omnipresent but minor component in sandy deposits; also in derived metamorphic rocks

- Occurrence in soils - seldom observed in soil thin sections, except for highly weathered material (e.g., oxic), in which it is concentrated by residual enrichment  
- Alteration - one of the most stable minerals, with no visible chemical alteration at microscopic scale

# 1. Introduction

Pedogenic siliceous features occur as crystalline forms, such as quartz, tridymite and cristobalite, and as poorly ordered or non-crystalline forms including opal-A and opal-CT. Silica may be concentrated in varying degrees through weathering, vertical and lateral translocation, and precipitation and dissolution, resulting in numerous macromorphological forms expressed as silica-rich horizons, including cemented formations or duricrusts (e.g., silcretes and duripans) and non-cemented or poorly cemented materials (e.g., fragipans and sepiocretes).

Historically, micromorphological studies dealing with pedogenic silica started in the 1960s, focusing on arid and semiarid climatic regions and on areas with volcanic materials. McKeague and Cline (1963) provided the first comprehensive overview of siliceous features in soils, discussing their forms, origin and deposition through pedogenic

and biogenic processes, as well as their geographic distribution. Yarilova (1956) studied siliceous features for chernozems, Litchfield and Mabbut (1962) for duripans in Australia, Arnold (1963) for brunizems in the United States and von Buch (1967) for soils on volcanic ashes. Later, the petrography and mineralogy of silica in soils and palaeosols was studied worldwide (see Table 2).

The aim of this chapter is to review micromorphological aspects of pedogenic silica accumulations in soils, palaeosols and regoliths.

# 2. Forms of Silica

Siliceous features in soils and regoliths comprise both crystalline  $\mathrm{SiO}_2$  polymorphs (quartz, tridymite and cristobalite) and hydrated  $\mathrm{SiO}_2$  forms ( $\mathrm{SiO}_2\cdot \mathrm{nH}_2\mathrm{O}$ ), with varying degrees of crystallinity, elemental impurities and water content (opal-A,opal-C,opal-CT). Comprehensive descriptions of silica polymorphs can be found in publications

As described for marine sediments, the generalised diagenetic sequence for silica is opal-A (siliceous biogenic ooze)  $\rightarrow$  opal- $\mathrm{A}'$  (secondary amorphous silica)  $\rightarrow$  opal-CT  $\rightarrow$  reordered opal-CT  $\rightarrow$  cryptocrystalline quartz or chalcedony  $\rightarrow$  microcrystalline quartz (Williams et al., 1985). The main factors related to the diagenetic transformations (dissolution-reprecipitation) of non-crystalline opal-A to microcrystalline quartz are temperature, pH, ionic strength and degree of silica saturation (Iler, 1973, 1979; Williams et al., 1985). Burial depth, time, heat flow and host materials are other important factors (Stamatakis et al., 1991).

Because the optical determination of the various  $\mathrm{SiO}_2$  minerals is not always evident, a combination of other techniques (X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, differential thermal analysis, infrared spectroscopy) is recommended. Using these techniques, several researchers determined the quantity, composition and distribution of silica in soils and regoliths (Smith & Whalley, 1982; Drees et al., 1989; Singh & Gilkes, 1993; Petrovic et al., 1996; Monger & Kelly, 2002; Mantha et al., 2012; Schmidht et al., 2013; Zhang & Moxon, 2014). Determination of the elemental ratio of Si to Al by EDS or WDS analysis (Boettinger & Southard, 1990; Chartres & Fitzgerald, 1990; Effland, 1990) or of oxygen isotope ratios may be necessary, for instance, to establish whether a component is inherited or pedogenic (Mizota et al., 1991). High-resolution petrographic and submicroscopic investigations are relevant to evaluate the alteration of the various forms of silica (Thiry et al., 2014).

# 2.1 Quartz and Chalcedony

Quartz is the most widely recognised silica mineral in almost all soils and parent materials, as a dominant inherited component of the silt and sand fractions. Its habit in soils is mainly anhedral (Drees et al., 1989). Euhedral authigenic quartz crystals or overgrowths (Fig. 1) have been reported for earth-surface environments (Chafetz & Zhang,

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/ae28dafe-65ba-4bf7-be4a-38f6effed811/8c6c8dd12d1b430fef5623c57a803b6d4ada60cf3943f98f068a032be15c46bc.jpg)

1998), including silcrete occurrences (Thiry, 1997, 1999). Quartz is precipitated at low temperature in soils or at water table levels. It has a higher solubility than quartz grains that are part of the groundmass, which have an ultimately magmatic origin, because pedogenic quartz typically has lower crystallinity and more structural defects (Thiry et al., 2014). The crystal size of pedogenic quartz ranges from crypto- to macrocrystalline.

Although quartz is considered to be a resistant mineral, several studies have shown that it is susceptible to weathering, with climate, time, organic acids, morphology and surface area as important controlling factors (Crook, 1968; Claisse, 1972; Krinsley & Doornkamp, 1973; Eswaran & Stoops, 1979; Bennett, 1991; Pell & Chivas, 1995; Scarciglia et al., 2005). In this regard, quartz grains show a combination of chemical dissolution and precipitation surface features. Characteristics of dissolution include etch patterning, triangular etch pits and solution features, whereas precipitation features include edge rounding, silica veneers and plate- and sheetlike structures. The degree of quartz weathering can be established by the frequency and size of etch pits (Marcelino & Stoops, 1996; Marcelino et al., 1999). For example, during long-term exposure to chemical weathering, quartz shows progressively deeper dissolution features: triangular etch pits, then an interconnected network of grooves and crevasses (Leneuf, 1973; Le Ribault, 1977; Tshidibi, 1985; Marcelino & Stoops, 1996; Marcelino et al., 1999; Moretti & Morras, 2013) and finally complete dissolution of the grain (Howard et al., 1996). In tropical regions, fractures are frequently filled with iron oxides and other compounds producing a feature called runiquartz (Eswaran et al., 1975; see Marcelino et al., 2018; Stoops & Marcelino, 2018).

Pedogenic quartz features such as infillings, coatings (e.g., Milnes et al., 1991; Thiry & Milnes, 1991; Thiry, 1992; Misik, 1996; Thiry & Ribet, 1999) or crystal intergrowths (e.g., Bustillo & Pérez-Jiménez, 2005; El Khoriby, 2005) were described for silcretes or palaeosols (Srivastava & Sauer, 2014). Eswaran (1972) observed quartz nodules and coatings crystallised from soil solutions saturated with silica derived from weathering of basaltic rocks in Ultisols.

Chalcedony is a fibrous microcrystalline quartz variety (Fig. 2). Two varieties are recognised according to sign of elongation (length-slow or length-fast) (Folk & Pittman, 1971; Keene, 1983). It is most commonly length-fast, implying that the fibres are elongated perpendicular to the c-axis of quartz (e.g., Graetsch, 1994). Length-slow chalcedony, composed of fibres elongated parallel to the c-axis (e.g., Miehe et al., 1984), is more rare and has been related to conditions with high alkalinity (e.g., Folk & Pittman, 1971; Arbey, 1980; English, 2001; Bustillo & Alonso-Zarza, 2007), although this has to be done with caution (Keene, 1983), and it has also been related to evaporitic environments (Keene, 1983; Heaney & Post, 1992). Fluctuations in water composition can result in a succession of layers of length-fast and length-slow chalcedony in vughs (Summerfield, 1983b). Their crystal size seems to be controlled by the nature of silica supply.

Pedofeatures composed of chalcedony include coatings, which have been described for duripans (Flach et al., 1974; Oleschko, 1990; Rodas et al., 1994; Curlik & Forgac,

1996; Thiry, 1999; Sauer et al., 2015), silcretes (Watts, 1978), silicified sandstone (e.g., Thiry & Ben Brahim, 1990), petroplinthite (Rellini et al., 2015), calcretes and silcretes (McCoy, 2011) and Ultisols (Moretti & Morras, 2013). The tendency of increasing crystal size towards vugh or channel centres suggests a declining rate of flow of silica-bearing solutions, in response to progressive void infilling and porosity reduction (Summerfield, 1983b). Other pedofeatures are loose continuous infillings with length-fast chalcedony in volcanic soils (Curlik & Forgac, 1996), nodules of length-slow chalcedony (Thiry & Milnes, 1991), loose discontinuous infillings of length-slow and length-fast chalcedony in silcretes (McCoy, 2011), microlaminar infillings (Thiry & Simon-Coinçon, 1996), and microlaminated bow-like infillings of length-slow and length-fast chalcedony with associated fine- and coarse-grained quartz in silcretes (Summerfield, 1983b), typic nodules  $(1 - 5\mathrm{mm})$  of length-slow chalcedony in silcretes (Misik, 1996), concentric nodules of length-fast chalcedony in silcretes (Watts, 1978) and aggregates of silica spherulites  $(1 - 5\mathrm{mm})$  composed of length-slow chalcedony,

which is transformed to coarse-grained quartz with radial undulatory extinction along the outer edge (Misik, 1996).

# 2.2 Cristobalite and Tridymite

Cristobalite and tridymite are  $\mathrm{SiO}_2$  polymorphs in which  $\mathrm{SiO}_4$  tetrahedra are packed in a two-layer structure (tridymite) or in a three-layer structure (cristobalite) (Drees et al., 1989). The more open structure of cristobalite and tridymite in comparison with quartz allows a certain degree of incorporation of other elements into the crystal structure.

Cristobalite is usually reported, in thin section, as white to milky white, ranging from translucent to opaque in PPL (e.g., Howard, 1939; Usai & Dalrymple, 2003; Gutiérrez-Castorena et al., 2006). It occurs commonly as detrital grains in soils that formed on pyroclastic volcanic materials (Parfitt & Wilson, 1985, Mizota et al., 1987; Drees et al., 1989; Cronin et al., 1996; Molina-Ballesteros et al., 1997; Sommer et al., 2006). It has also been reported as part of the fine fraction of alluvial or lacustrine sediments (Reséndiz-Paz et al., 2013; Rivera-Vargas, 2013) and of soils around tailings piles (Duarte-Zaragoza et al., 2015).

Cristobalite forms several types of pedofeatures, such as coatings in andesitic lava (Nieuwenhuyse & Verburg, 2000), typic and amboidal nodules in alluvial fans (Bustillo & Alonso-Zarza, 2003), and microlaminated coatings and fissure infillings in duripans (Gutiérrez-Castorena et al., 2006, 2007; Quantin, 2010). Transformation from opal to cristobalite in duripans on volcanic ash is related to dehydration during dry seasons (Elssas et al., 2000) or following artificial drying of lacustrine sediments with high amorphous silica content (Gutiérrez-Castorena et al., 2006).

Tridymite occurs less frequently in soils and is only rarely recognised as a pedofeature. It has been reported for siliceous calcretes (Vaniman et al., 1994), limestone (Verstraten & Sevink, 1979), chalk (Nørnberg et al., 1985) and silcretes (McCoy, 2011). Mulyanto and Stoops (2003) described thick coatings consisting of prismatic tridymite crystals oriented perpendicular to the pore walls in weathered andesite. The crystals are corroded, which is probably linked to hydrothermal processes at high pH.

# 2.3 Opal

Opal is a hydrated form of  $\mathrm{SiO}_2$  with a wide range of crystallinity, with water contents ranging from  $1.5\mathrm{wt}\%$  for opal-C to approximately  $34\mathrm{wt}\%$  for amorphous plant opals (Monger & Kelly, 2002). In transmitted light, the colour of opal-A ranges from colourless over light tan to various shades of brown to black (Drees et al., 1989); it is optically isotropic to weakly anisotropic in XPL (Figs. 3 and 4). In SEM images, opal-A coatings in duripans appear as bodies with a dense vitreous appearance, often containing small silica spheres ( $1\mu \mathrm{m}$ ) (Sullivan, 1994), whereas opal-CT can appear as small lepispheres ( $<10\mu \mathrm{m}$ ).

Opal-A is mainly found as phytoliths, diatoms, sponge spicules and radiolaria (Monger & Kelly, 2002; see Kaczorek et al., 2018). As non-biogenic precipitate, it forms in

various soils and young sediments when environmental conditions favour supersaturated Si levels in solution (Drees et al., 1989), and it can eventually be transformed to crystalline phases such as cristobalite and quartz (Thiry et al., 2014). Opal-A has been described as pendants, typic coatings and infillings, occurring in volcanic materials (Harden et al., 1991; Hessmann, 1992; Poetsch & Arikas, 1997; Gutiérrez-Castorena et al., 2007), on marine terraces (Moody & Graham, 1997), in saprolites (Chadwick et al., 1987, 1995; Milnes et al., 1991; Sauer et al., 2015), in silcretes (Thiry & Millot, 1987; Thiry & Milnes, 1991; Rodas et al., 1994; Thiry et al., 2006; Sauer et al., 2015), in duripans (Gutiérrez-Castorena et al., 2006), in tundra soils (Pustovoytov, 1998), and in Alfisols (Munk & Southard, 1993). Blank and Fosberg (1990) reported two types of opal in gravel coatings and pendants associated with carbonate accumulations in alluvial fan deposits: clear opal (clear to translucent and colourless or light brown to yellow, optically isotropic), and dirty opal (mottled, grey, translucent, optically isotropic, milky adamantine lustre in OIL). Opal-A has been observed as nodules in laminar duripans (Chadwick et al., 1987, 1995; Thiry et al., 2006) and palustrine deposits (Mees, 1999; Gutiérrez-Castorena et al., 2005, 2006), as coatings in duripans on volcanic

material (Hessmann, 1992; Poetsch & Arikas, 1997; Gutiérrez-Castorena et al., 2007), as infillings in saprolites (Milnes et al., 1991) and as pendants in Palexeralfs (Munk & Southard, 1993).

Opal-A is often associated with other minerals, partly as laminar coatings, in which it is interlayered with micritic calcite (Blank & Fosberg, 1991b), ferruginous material (Kendrick & Graham, 2004), halloysite-smectite (Gutiérrez-Castorena et al., 2007) and unidentified phyllosilicates (Chadwick et al., 1987). Plet et al. (2012) described brown opal nodules and infillings in silcretes-calcretes.

Opal-CT has been described for sediments (Williams et al., 1985; Drees et al., 1989), groundwater silcretes (Thiry, 1999), petrified wood in volcanic ash soils (Dubroeucq et al., 1997) and duricrusts (Rodas et al., 1994). One example is coatings and infillings of opal-CT (Fig. 4) observed for volcanic soils in Mexico (Ma. del C. Gutierrez-Castorena, unpublished data). Usai and Dalrymple (2003) described opal-C with accessory opal-A, opal-CT and well-ordered cristobalite as whitish or brownish coatings and infillings in a buried palaeosoil in Sardinia. In duripans that formed in volcanic ash, halloysite may be subjected to progressive transformation to opal-A or opal-C, through loss of aluminium during alteration of clay minerals (Elssas et al., 2000).

# 3. Pedogenic Silica and Types of Duricrust

Accumulation of silica in soils or regoliths is controlled by various environmental factors such as temperature, soil pH, oxidation-reduction potential, presence of cations, organic compounds and iron oxides, and the occurrence and activity of various silica-concentrating organisms (Brinkman, 1977; Iler, 1979; Sommer et al., 2006; Thiry et al., 2014). Other factors that affect silicification process include porosity, groundwater flow and changes in salinity of pore fluids that induce silica precipitation (Bustillo, 2010).

The solubility of silica is nearly constant between pH values of 2.0 and 8.5 (50-60 mg/L), but it increases markedly above pH 9, reaching several thousand mg/L at pH 11 (e.g., Drees et al., 1989). In addition, the solubility of silica is controlled by other factors such as crystallinity and degree of impurity. For example, highly crystalline minerals with only small amounts of impurities typically exhibit lower solubility (Monger & Kelly, 2002) than poorly ordered or non-crystalline forms with higher concentrations of impurities (Drees et al., 1989). Different sequences reported for duricrusts are opal-A → opal-CT (Jones & Segnit, 1971; Lynne & Campbell, 2004); opal-CT → microcrystalline quartz (Williams et al., 1985); opal-CT → quartz (Cady et al., 1996); and microcrystalline quartz → macrocrystalline quartz (Flörke et al., 1982, 1991; Moxon et al., 2006; Nash & Ullyott, 2007).

Pedogenic silica can cement soil particles, binding them at grain contact points (Monger & Kelly, 2002). Larger amounts of pedogenic silica might be required to harden sandy soils than clayey soils (Singh & Gilkes, 1993). The groundmass of the latter can be considered to be an integral part of the cement because it acts as a sorption surface (Chadwick & Nettleton, 1990). Pedogenic silica may also occur as nanocrystalline or crystalline pedofeatures (coatings, infillings and nodules) (Webb et al., 2013). During weathering, movement and deposition of silica results in development of cemented horizons in saprolites (Milnes et al., 1991). Depending on the type of parent material, different pedofeatures can form. For example, pale brown fibrous opal, overlain by limpid chalcedony, has been described for clayey materials, whereas infillings composed of fibrous opal-CT and massive limpid chalcedony occur in sandy sediments. When interstitial clay is absent, quartz coatings can form on quartz grains that are part of the groundmass.

Cemented silica horizons are classified as silcretes and duripans, and non-cemented horizons with silica-enrichment can qualify as fragipans. Differences between these types of horizons are related to illuvial processes, degree of crystallisation and other factors. Milnes et al. (1991) observed that pedogenic silcretes typically contain microcrystalline quartz, whereas duripans are characterised by opal-A as pedogenic silica phase.

Selected examples of occurrences of pedogenic silica in soils, sediments and regoliths are presented in Table 2. Micromorphological classifications exist for silcretes (Summerfield, 1983a; Nash & Ullyott, 2007; Ullyott et al., 2015), but no general classification that considers all types of silica-cemented horizons is available.

# 3.1 Silcretes

Silcrete is a lithological term for a strongly indurated rock composed mainly of inherited quartz grains and siliceous cement (Singh et al., 1992). The term was first suggested by Lamplugh (1902) to describe a highly resistant and well-cemented near-surface crust formed by silica accumulation, cementing a pre-existing soil, sediment, rock or weathered material (Nash & Ullyott, 2007). As silcretes range widely in age, although they are mainly recognized for Cainozoic formations (Summerfield, 1983a; Monger & Kelly, 2002), they can be cemented by various  $\mathrm{SiO}_2$  polymorphs and other components (Fig. 5), and

they can present distinctive morphological and mineralogical features resulting from a succession of phases of silica dissolution and crystallisation (Thiry et al., 2006). Mainly, non-fibrous microcrystalline quartz has been reported (Khalaf, 1988; Milnes et al., 1991; Thiry & Simon-Coinçon, 1996), but opal and chalcedony with small amounts of non-fibrous quartz (Rodas et al., 1994) and opal-A to opal-CT (Curlik & Forgac, 1996; Lee & Gilkes, 2005) have also been observed, as well as disordered, length-fast chalcedony and nearly optically isotropic cryptocrystalline silica (Shaw & Nash, 1998). Singh et al. (1992) mention the presence of fine-grained kaolinite, zircon and anatase. The anatase  $(\mathrm{TiO}_2)$  is used as an indication of the high degree of weathering of the parent material (Watts, 1980; Summerfield, 1983b; Nash et al., 1994). For calcrete-silcrete intergrades, Watts (1980) reports four different types of silica cement, with quartz replacing calcite in advanced stages of silcrete formation. Types of silica cement range from opaline silica in a thin  $(<5\mu \mathrm{m})$  diffuse layer over a moderately thick layer of semi-opaque brown, length-slow chalcedony, to a rapidly alternating sequence of length-fast and length-slow chalcedony, followed by a quartz infilling. Detailed mineralogical and micromorphological studies show that silica can systematically change with decreasing depth from more soluble to less soluble phases: opal  $\rightarrow$  microcrystalline quartz  $\rightarrow$  euhedral quartz (Thiry et al., 2014), with different features at each stage.

Silcretes occur extensively in arid and semiarid regions of southern Africa (e.g., Summerfield, 1983a, 1983b) and Australia (e.g., Thiry & Milnes, 1991; Lee & Gilkes, 2005) (Table 2). They are typically more strongly cemented and presumably older than duripans (Monger & Kelly, 2002). Silcretes can be formed in various environmental conditions, with regard to pH and climate (Summerfield, 1979, 1983b). For instance, Wopfner (1978) reports quartz silcretes in kaolinised profiles formed in acid groundwater environments, as well as opal silcretes formed under alkaline hypersaline conditions. Most fabrics of silcretes reflect successive dissolution, precipitation, recrystallisation and reworking in soil conditions (Watts, 1978), and they also record the influence of parent material characteristics and geochemical environments during initial silica precipitation and postsilicification diagenesis (Summerfield, 1983a; Lee & Gilkes, 2005). Some silcretes result from the silicification of more or less weathered rocks, or by replacement of carbonates by microcrystalline quartz (Thiry & Ben Brahim, 1990).

Pedogenic silcretes can form in various environmental conditions with alternating wet and dry seasons, causing multiple episodes of water infiltration and percolation (Summerfield, 1979, 1983a; Thiry et al., 2006). Strong evaporation during dry periods results in an increase in pH, favouring alteration of silicates that are part of the groundmass, whereas in the beginning of the wet period, a drop in pH results in opal precipitation (Blanco et al., 2008). Non-pedogenic types of silcretes can form under the influence of phreatic conditions (groundwater silcrete), in alluvial sediment fills (drainage-line silcretes) and along lake margins (pan or lacustrine silcrete) (Ullyott et al., 2004; Nash & Ullyott, 2007; Ullyott & Nash, 2016).

Silcretes have been classified according to their morphology and mineralogical composition (Smale, 1973; Wopfner, 1978), genesis (Milnes & Thiry, 1992; Thiry, 1999), and petrographical or micromorphological features (Goudie, 1973; Wopfner, 1978; Summerfield, 1983a; Milnes & Thiry, 1992; Thiry, 1999; Webb et al., 2013; Thiry et al., 2014; Ullyott & Nash, 2016). Based on their genesis, chemical composition and the geomorphological setting, Nash and Ullyott (2007) divided silcretes into five categories, comprising two pedogenic types and three non-pedogenic types.

# 3.1.1 Pedogenic Silcretes

Silcretes show a complex fabric with a variety of features that overwrite the original fabric of the parent material (Thiry, 1999; Webb et al., 2013), as a result of a succession of phases of silica dissolution and recrystallisation during multiple episodes of water infiltration and percolation in alternately wet and dry conditions (Watts, 1978; Thiry & Millot, 1987; Thiry et al., 2006).

In the groundmass of silcretes, various polymorphs of silica occur. Distinguishing between inherited and pedogenetic silica polymorphs can be difficult. Microcrystalline quartz or chalcedony can give rise to a quartz-crystallitic b-fabric (Webb & Goulding, 1998; Nash & Hopkinson, 2004; Ulytott et al., 2015; Ulytott & Nash, 2016). When opal dominates, an undifferentiated b-fabric is observed (Smale, 1973; McCoy, 2011; Fossum, 2012). In silcretes-calcretes, a quartz-calcite-crystallitic b-fabric is common (Vaniman et al., 1994; Nash et al., 2004; Plet et al., 2012). During silcrete development, the c/f-related distribution pattern of the soil as a whole typically changes gradually from monic to chitonic or gefuric, followed by single- and double-spaced porphyric, and in the final stage, by open porphyric (Summerfield, 1983a, 1983b). Singh et al. (1992) report a close porphyric c/f-related distribution pattern and the occurrence of two cement types in the packing voids: (i) an opaque cement, pale yellow in reflected light, composed of microcrystalline quartz, anatase and zircon, and (ii) a translucent brown cement, white in reflected light, with a banded, gel-like massive texture, composed of aluminosilicates (kaolinite) that formed at a later stage. Coatings and infillings are the most common pedofeatures.

Opal coatings are common as overgrowths on quartz grains (Thiry et al., 2014), formed by dissolution-precipitation processes (Webb & Goulding, 1998; Thiry, 1999; Fossum, 2012; Sauer et al., 2015). Coatings and dense infillings composed of opal-A, opal-CT or gel-like aluminosilicates (Singh et al., 1992; Thiry, 1992), or loose infillings consisting of chalcedony or non-fibrous quartz (Summerfield, 1983a) are common as illuvial features. Thiry (1992) reports various illuvial pedofeatures that are typical of pedogenic silcretes, such as loose continuous infillings of quartz grains at the top of the silcrete, laminar coatings of microcrystalline quartz overlain by opal in the middle part, and laminar coatings and infillings of opal at the base. Thiry and Simon-Coincon (1996) describe alternating layers of quartz grains cemented by microcrystalline quartz in silcretes formed in palaeoclimate conditions with a pronounced dry season. Compound coatings/infillings consisting of various silica types (e.g., opal, chalcedony, non-fibrous

quartz) usually occur in subsurface horizons (Thiry & Milnes, 1991; Thiry, 1999), starting with amorphous opal and progressing through chalcedony to non-fibrous microcrystalline and coarser quartz towards the centre of voids (Thiry, 1978, 1988, 1992; Thiry & Millot, 1987; Rodas et al., 1994; Molina-Ballesteros et al., 1997). Typic chalcedony coatings are formed by illuviation and recrystallisation (Summerfield, 1982; Thiry & Milnes, 1991; Fossum, 2012; Thiry et al., 2014; Sauer et al., 2015).

Crescent coatings and infillings are often composed of laminae consisting of various silica phases, clay and  $\mathrm{TiO_2}$  (Summerfield, 1982; Callen, 1983; Thiry & Millot, 1987; Thiry, 1992, 1999; Webb & Goulding, 1998). Their origin is unclear, but the fact that they are related to macropores indicates that they are formed at sites of preferential flow of solutions (Nash & Ullyott, 2007; Ullyott & Nash, 2016). Biological activity can also be involved in the formation of these crescent coatings (McCoy, 2011). The type of silica is partly controlled by soil solution composition, whereas the  $\mathrm{TiO_2}$  phase is a residual product of mineral dissolution (Watts, 1980; Thiry, 1997; Thiry et al., 2014).

# 3.1.2 Groundwater and Palustrine Silcretes

In non-pedogenic silcretes, structures of the parent material are well preserved (Wopfner, 1983; Thiry & Milnes, 1991; Milnes & Thiry, 1992; Thiry et al., 2014). The c/f-related distribution pattern can be open, double-spaced or single-spaced porphyric, which has been described for cases where calcite or dolomite cements were replaced by silica (Watts, 1980; Bustillo & Alonso-Zarza, 2007; Thiry et al., 2015) or sepiolite (Francis et al., 2013). In groundwater silcretes, typic coatings and cappings (Tofalo & Pazos, 2010; Dupuis et al., 2014) or dense complete infillings (Tofalo & Pazos, 2010) have been described to occur, composed of various types of authigenic silica such as opal-CT, cristobalite and tridymite (Wopfner, 1983), chalcedony and non-fibrous microcrystalline quartz (Thiry, 1999), and micro- and/or macrocrystalline quartz (Ullyott et al., 2004, 2015). Significant accumulations of  $\mathrm{TiO_2}$  are absent (Thiry, 1999; Thiry et al., 2014). Cappings composed of microcrystalline quartz are related to translocation of fine material and subsequent silicification (Ullyott et al., 2004, 2015). These features originate from phreatic fluctuations (Thiry & Milnes, 1991), climatic changes from wet to dry (Callen, 1983) or variations in pH (Shaw & Nash, 1998), causing silica precipitation.

In pan/lacustrine silcretes, lenticular and irregular opal nodules are common (Fig. 6). They are formed by changes in pore fluid salinity, inducing opal precipitation (Armenteros et al., 1995; Thiry, 1999; Ringrose et al., 2005; Gutiérrez-Castorena et al., 2006; Bustillo, 2010).

# 3.2 Duripans

A duripan is an indurated subsurface diagnostic soil horizon cemented by illuvial silica (Chartres & Fitzgerald, 1990; Singh & Gilkes, 1993), usually in the form of opal or microcrystalline quartz, and may or may not contain additional cementing agents such as calcite (Neuendorf et al., 2007; Soil Survey Staff, 2014). Weakly cemented to indurated

nodules of opal or microcrystalline quartz (durinodes) are the most common pedofeatures in duripans (Soil Survey Staff, 2014). Opal can be identified by its limpid, light yellow to dull grey aspect in PPL, and by its optical isotropy in XPL (Fig. 7) (Chadwick et al., 1987; Sullivan, 1994). This indurated horizon has various local names, such as red-brown hardpan in Australia (Litchfield & Mabbut, 1962), and tepetate or canganhua in Latin America, the latter two referring to duripans in soils on volcanic ash.

The formation of silica features is more related to the stage of soil development, parent material, degree of cementation, soil fabric and location within the horizon than to the source of silica (e.g., weathering of dust inputs or surface horizons) and hydrological aspects (e.g., lateral subsurface flow, groundwater depth, water movement) (Chadwick et al., 1987).

Soil fabrics influence the type of opaline silica precipitation. Chadwick et al. (1987) mention that, in loamy soils, opaline silica occurs as bridges between sand grains and as small  $(1 - 5\mu \mathrm{m})$  nodules and intercalations that impregnate clay aggregates and sesquioxides. In loamy soils, opaline silica and clay occur as compound coatings, whereas in sandy soils opaline silica occurs as laminar coatings. Laminated opal infillings, concentric nodules and other composite features with chalcedony and calcite have been reported for alluvial fans (Blank & Fosberg, 1990, 1991a, 1991b) and for Mollisols and Aridisols (Chadwick et al., 1995). By the end of the process of duripan development, a porphyric c/f-related distribution pattern has formed (Chadwick et al., 1987). Amorphous silica deposits on sand grains in duripans were described by Chartres and Norton (1994) and Hollingsworth and Fitzpatrick (1994), both using submicroscopic techniques.

Silica cementation starts as small, diffuse, optically isotropic opal nodules, or as silica coatings on ped faces. In more strongly developed duripans, chalcedony appears as extremely thin  $(1.0\mu \mathrm{m})$ , weakly birefringent intercalations, throughout the groundmass and associated with clay coatings (Flach et al., 1969). In marine terraces, the following features appear successively with increasing degree of cementation (Moody & Graham, 1997): opal coatings and bridges on sand grains in weakly cemented material, then opal that partially fills packing voids and later complete infillings of those voids, resulting in a completely cemented material (Moody & Graham, 1997).

Complex silica pedofeatures can form when various processes occur at different stages, related to aeolian input, subaerial exposure, erosion and colonisation by cryptogamic organisms (Blank et al., 1998), or in response to climate fluctuations or bioturbation (Eghbal & Southard, 1993), such as laminated opal infillings, concentric nodules and other composite features containing chalcedony and calcite (Blank & Fosberg, 1990, 1991a, 1991b; Chadwick et al., 1995).

Within different layers of the duripan, different pedofeatures can be recognised. Boettinger and Southard (1990) report that opaline silica is present as distinct laminae  $(2 - 10\mu \mathrm{m})$  in the laminar cap of a duripan, whereas spheroidal and ellipsoidal nodules  $(0.04 - 1.0\mathrm{mm})$  occur within the calcite-dominated groundmass beneath the thin laminar cap.

In some regions, duripans on volcanic ash are important materials, with specific micromorphological characteristics. In duripans that developed in ash-flow tuff deposits, silica first precipitates as pendants, it then impregnates the groundmass and it finally precipitates around the clasts in the form of coatings (Kendrick & Graham, 2004).

All of those features eventually produce a plugged horizon with a laminar cap (Harden et al., 1991).

Cementing agents in silica-enriched soil horizons in volcanic ashes in various regions of Mexico (see also Sedov et al., 2010; Stoops et al., 2018) mainly consist of opaline silica (Hidalgo et al., 1992; Poetsch & Arikas, 1997; Poetsch, 2004), carbonates (Gutiérrez-Castorena & Ortiz-Solorio, 1992) and silica associated with illuvial clay and iron oxides (Acevedo-Sandoval et al., 2004). Opal-A is present as microlaminar brown yellow, optically isotropic coatings and infillings and as part of the groundmass with an undifferentiated b-fabric (Hessmann, 1992; Poetsch & Arikas, 1997; Gutiérrez-Castorena et al., 2007). Compound coatings and infillings composed of clay, opal-A, opal-CT and microcrystalline cristobalite have been described (Quantin, 2010). Nimlos (1989) reports silica films (up to  $1\mathrm{mm}$ ) at depths of up to  $3\mathrm{m}$ , supporting the hypothesis of silica illuviation. These indurated horizons are the product of complex soil processes (eluviation-illuviation), redoximorphic conditions, clay degradation and progressive silicification (Quantin, 2010), although erosion/sedimentation processes have also been reported (Gutiérrez-Castorena et al., 2007). For similar formations in Ecuador and surrounding countries, silica cementation by colourless amorphous silica associated with clay coatings on planar voids was described by Creutzberg et al. (1990).

Duripans may occur in association with calcic or petrocalic horizons. In this case, silica tends to be mutually exclusive with calcite: opaline silica impregnates the groundmass, whereas carbonates occur as infillings, at least in loamy soils (Chadwick et al., 1987). Silica and calcium carbonates can have a phreatic origin rather than being exclusively pedogenic (Monger & Adams, 1996). Laminar cappings and spheroidal to ellipsoidal nodules  $(0.04 - 1.0\mathrm{mm})$  with crystallitic b-fabric (Boettinger & Southard, 1990) or lined by clay coatings (Monger & Adams, 1996) are recognized for these environments.

# 3.3 Fragipans

Fragipan is a subsurface diagnostic horizon that is compact but not or only weakly cemented, with evidence of pedogenesis (e.g., soil structure) and limited root penetration, a brittle consistency and redoximorphic features (Soil Survey Staff, 2014).

Several researchers have concluded that amorphous silica coatings (Harlan et al., 1977; Franzmeier et al., 1991) and illuvial or authigenic clay explain the brittle consistency of fragipans (Steinhardt et al., 1982; Lindbo & Veneman, 1989; Norton, 1994). In addition, iron and aluminium compounds can be present (Bridges & Bull, 1983; Brown & Mahler, 1988; Marsan & Torrent, 1989; Duncan & Franzmeier, 1999; Szymański et al., 2012). Weisenborn and Schaetzl (2005a, 2005b) report non-laminated or microlaminated typic and crescent coatings and infillings, composed of silty clay or silt, as well as dense infillings of Al compounds, Fe oxides, organic matter and  $\mathrm{SiO}_2$ .

Chartres and Norton (1994) observed that silica and nanocrystalline Fe oxides (ferrihydrite), adhering to clay surfaces, are important elements in the cohesion of a fragipan. Mullins et al. (1990), McKyes et al. (1994) and Daniells (2012) demonstrated

that silica coatings on mineral surfaces, under reduced humidity, promote reduction of porosity and hydraulic conductivity of soils.

Using SEM and EDS analysis of samples of E horizons, Weisenborn (2001) described dissolution pits on quartz grain surfaces. They have also been observed for duripans (Thompson et al., 1994).

Some silica-enriched horizons on volcanic ash that meet the requirements of fragipan (Gutiérrez-Castorena et al., 2007) show slightly birefringent, limpid, non-laminated, dense complete infillings of opal-CT, resulting in materials with chitonic and double-spaced porphyric c/f-related distribution patterns and undifferentiated b-fabric.

# 4. Conclusions

Pedogenic siliceous features in soils can occur in many different phases, ranging from amorphous opal-A over opal-C and opal-CT to chalcedony and non-fibrous microcrystalline quartz. These materials are responsible for the formation of certain diagnostic soil horizons (fragipans, duripans), as well as silcretes and other types of silicified soil or regolith horizons, with a wide range of ages.

Fragipans, duripans and pedogenic silcretes differ in complexity and mineralogical composition. In fragipans, features are relatively simple (e.g., typic coatings, infillings, nodules) and mainly consist of opal. In duripans and silcretes, the features are more complex (e.g., typic and laminar coatings/infillings), and they consist of various silica phases (opal, opal-CT, cristobalite, chalcedony and non-fibrous microcrystalline quartz).

Systematic micromorphological studies of duricrusts are strongly recommended because current understanding of their development in various settings is still incomplete, and the proven potential of microscopic studies can still be more fully explored. As distinction between opal and fine-grained Si-Al colloids is almost impossible with current optical techniques, more research using other in situ analytical techniques is needed.

# 1. Introduction

This chapter discusses the interpretation of micromorphological observations of biogenic siliceous features in soils, palaeosols and regoliths. Forms of biogenic silica may be grouped according to the organisms associated with their formation: (i) phytogenic silica, defined as silica precipitates in roots, stems, branches, leafs and needles of plants, making a distinction between phytoliths  $(\geq 5\mu \mathrm{m})$  and undefined remnants  $(< 5\mu \mathrm{m})$ ; (ii) microbial silica, including bacterial and fungal deposits; (iii) protozoic silica,

comprising diatom frustules and testate amoeba shells; and (iv) zoogenic silica, such as sponge spicules (Sommer et al., 2006). Using micromorphology, selective dissolution techniques and other investigation procedures, biogenic siliceous features are studied to help to observe, record, interpret and conceptualise processes of soil genesis and to provide information on landscape evolution.

The microscopic study of biogenic silica has a fairly long tradition. The first microscopic descriptions of phytoliths were recorded around 1843 by Ehrenberg (1843, 1844, 1845, 1846); however, Ruprecht (1866) is credited with being the first to have noted the occurrence of opal phytoliths in soils (see Drees et al., 1989). Bobrov (2003) summarised the micropaleontological methods for studying biogenic silica in soils and palaeosols with profile depth distribution data for phytoliths, diatoms and sponge spicules. The role of phytogenic siliceous features in geoarchaeological studies was more recently reviewed by Shillito (2011a) and Vrydaghs et al. (2016). Analysis of biogenic silica can provide insight into current and past conditions of pedogenesis and reveal evolutionary trends in individual soils and pedosediments or more widely in the whole soil cover (e.g., Golyeva, 2008).

# 2. Phytoliths

# 2.1 Nature and Origin

Opal phytoliths are plant microfossils  $(5 - 250\mu \mathrm{m})$  , characterised by high negative relief and optical isotropism. They are generally colourless, although they can grade to light tan, brown and black (Gutiérrez-Castorena & Effland, 2010) because of carbon inclusions (Stoops 2003) or the presence of a coating. They generally show a clear whitish colour under OIL or transmitted dark-field illumination (Stoops, 2003). Some opal phytoliths are autofluorescent under ultraviolet or blue light (FitzPatrick, 1984; Stoops, 2003), a feature that appears to be lacking for recently formed phytoliths (Altemüller & Van VlietLanoe, 1990). Strong autofluorescence has been reported for phytoliths from Podzols and Andosols (Van Vliet-Lanoe, 1980).

Opal phytoliths are produced by polymerisation of monosilicic acid  $(\mathrm{Si(OH)}_4)$  within plant tissues, taken up by the roots and transported by the vascular system. Within the plant tissue, silica precipitation can occur in three different loci: the cell lumen, the intercellular space, and the cell wall. Polymerisation results in the formation of a morphological identifiable opal cast. Opal phytoliths can accumulate in all kinds of plant organs (Rapp & Mulholland, 1992): leaves (Piperno, 1988, 2006), inflorescence bracts (Ball et al., 1999), fruits (Piperno, 1989), seeds (Lentfer, 2009; Eichhorn et al., 2010), culms (Blackman, 1968), trunccks (Vrydaghs et al., 2001), woody tissue (Amos, 1952; Balan Menon, 1965; ter Welle, 1976a, 1976b; Vrydaghs et al., 1995) and roots (Tomlinson, 1961). Each plant organ is characterised by an association of different types of phytoliths, each with varying abundance. This multiplicity is made of phytoliths with specific morphologies and less specific or redundant morphologies (Rovner, 1971). In addition, their size varies according to their botanical origin (Wilding & Drees, 1974; Piperno, 2006).

Grasses are known to be an important plant group that can produce opal phytoliths (up to  $10\%$  silica by weight); however, opal phytoliths are also reported for Pteridophytes (Piperno, 1988, 2006), Gymnosperms (Klein & Geist, 1978; Sangster et al., 1997) and Angiosperms (Metcalfe & Chalk, 1950; Twiss et al., 1969; Brown, 1984; Bozarth, 1992; Kealhoffer & Piperno, 1998; Ball et al., 2006).

# 2.2 Occurrence in Soils

In soils and sediments, phytoliths can occur either within plant fragments (Fig. 1A) or within the groundmass (Fig. 1B).

Phytoliths have been observed for a variety of soils, such as Andosols (Stoops, 2003), Alfisols (Boettinger, 1994), Vertisols (Boettinger, 1994; see Kovda & Mermut, 2010, 2018), Podzols (Simons et al., 2000), Chernozems (Drees et al., 1989), Latosols (Kondo & Iwasa, 1981), Ultisols (Stoops et al., 1994), Histosols (Benvenuto et al., 2013) and Anthrosols (Devos et al., 2009). They are most commonly observed for A horizons and less commonly for B horizons. They are generally found in the groundmass and occasionally as infillings (Bullock et al. 1985; Stoops, 2003). In H horizons, phytoliths may constitute an important part of the coarse fraction. In soil profiles, their concentration commonly decreases with increasing depth within the upper  $50~\mathrm{cm}$  of the soil (Petó, 2010, 2013). Translocation into deeper horizons can result from bioturbation (Clarke, 2003), vertic behaviour (Boettinger, 1994; see also Kovda & Mermut, 2010, 2018) or transport by percolating water within the pore network (Stoops et al., 2001; Clarke, 2003; Sommer et al., 2006). Subsurface occurrences can also originate from burial of soil profiles (Golyeva, 2008). In alluvial soils, phytoliths may migrate laterally by water flow (Fishkis et al., 2010).

Records of phytoliths in soil thin sections appeared first in Russian literature (e.g., Parfenova & Yarilova, 1965). Over the last decades, several studies combining classical phytolith analysis with micromorphology were conducted (Macphail, 1981; Shahack-Gross et al., 2005; Barczi et al., 2006, 2009; Albert et al., 2008; French et al., 2009; Villagran et al., 2010; Petó & Barczi, 2011; Shillito & Ryan, 2013).

Several authors indicated the potential of phytolith analysis on thin sections to detail the depositional history of phytoliths (Osterrieth et al. 2009; Shillito 2011a, 2011b; Vrydaghs et al., 2016, 2017). Recently, a proposal for quantitative assessments of phytoliths based on the study of soil thin sections has been proposed (Devos et al., 2013a, 2013b; Vrydaghs et al., 2016). The occurrence and interpretation of phytoliths in archaeological soil materials and sediments is discussed in Vrydaghs et al. (2017).

Assuming silica is available in the environment, the formation of redundant morphotypes seems to be linked mainly to environmental conditions, whereas the formation of distinctive morphotypes would be genetically determined (Piperno et al., 2002; Piperno, 2006). As a consequence, the observation of redundant morphotypes in thin sections calls for further observations, as their occurrence should be correlated to more distinctive phytoliths. If this is not the case, such phytoliths could be intrusive.

The absence of phytoliths in thin sections should be considered with caution. As proposed by Stoops (2003), one should better state 'not recorded' rather than 'absent' when phytoliths are not observed. Besides a true absence of phytoliths, the quality of the thin sections, preservation conditions, the presence of coatings and the nature of the groundmass can also account for a lack of recorded phytoliths. This is particularly the case for clayey soils, without being restricted to that soil type. Contextual data should therefore be considered. The occurrence of other types of biogenic silica, particularly diatom remains, chrysophycean cysts and sponge spicules, could at least indicate that poor preservation is not an issue. In addition, the occurrence of plant tissue or organ residues points to the presence of plant remains, which may have released phytoliths into the soil.

# 2.3 Distribution Patterns

The basic paradigm of phytolith taphonomy is that phytoliths are released into the environment through the decay of plant remains, before or after the burial of those remains (e.g., Osterrieth et al., 2009; Madella & Lanceoletti, 2012). Besides natural decay of organic matter, human-induced processes, such as fire (Madella, 2003), dung deposition (Powers-Jones, 1994; Albert 2002) and plant processing (Harvey & Fuller, 2005), can also be at the origin of phytolith release. After being released, phytoliths can be transported, either before or after burial, by water (Vrydaghs, 2003), soil fauna or wind (Twiss et al., 1969; Fredlund & Tieszen, 1994; Osterrieth et al., 2009). This transport might be at the origin of altered distribution patterns as well as physical degradation of the phytoliths. Subsequently, recording the distribution patterns (sensu Stoops, 2003) of

opal phytoliths in thin sections and their relative frequencies compose one of the major issues of phytolith analysis using soil thin sections.

Three major basic distribution patterns of opal phytoliths have been recorded: isolated (Figs. 1B and 2), clustered (Fig. 3A to D) and articulated (Fig. 3E and F) (Vrydaghs et al., 2016). Isolated phytoliths are totally disarticulated and well separated. They appear in different orientations in thin sections. The origins of these phytoliths cannot be established, but their occurrence points either to perturbation or to the occurrence of intrusive material. Clustered phytoliths are groups of disarticulated phytoliths in which not all phytoliths share the same orientation (Fig. 3A and B) or are necessarily of the same type (Fig. 3C and D). Because the phytoliths in a cluster may be intrusive, they may have a different depositional history and originate from a different plant tissue, organ, individual or species. Clusters are a clear signature of a certain degree of disturbance. Articulated phytoliths are those that appear to maintain the relative distribution they had within the plant tissues in which they were accumulated

(see Albert et al., 2008; Shillito, 2011b; Vrydaghs et al., 2016, 2017) (Fig. 3E and F). A distinction needs to be made here between complete sections of silicified epidermal tissue in the form of contiguous cells (silica skeletons; Rosen, 1992) (Fig. 3E) and groups of phytoliths preserving their original anatomical connection but without the phytoliths being bounded together (Cabanes et al., 2010) (Fig. 3F). This latter pattern indicates that plant material was buried and then decayed in situ with no or minimal postdecay disturbance. Silica skeletons, on the other hand, do not necessarily involve in situ decomposition of plant material and can therefore also be intrusive.

# 2.4 State of Preservation

Thin section analysis documents the state of preservation of opal phytoliths. Up to now, no standard terminology for features produced by physical breakdown and chemical corrosion has been proposed. Weathered phytoliths might appear as broken, rounded or chipped particles. Broken phytoliths might present clear cuts, which do not coincide with the normal morphology of the phytoliths. Jenkins (2009) proposed that surface pitting of isolated phytoliths and breakdown of silica skeletons are alteration features. Benayas (1963) described corrosion patterns on phytoliths in soil thin sections.

Terms that have been proposed to describe weathering of mineral grains (Stoops et al., 1979; Bullock et al., 1985; Stoops, 2003) cannot be easily applied to phytoliths. A major difficulty in describing corrosion patterns of phytoliths in relation to taphonomical processes is that some features that look like weathering patterns have been recorded for phytoliths extracted from fresh plant reference material. Another difficulty is that phytoliths deriving from the same botanical source can present different aspects despite having been preserved in the same conditions. For instance, distinctive grass phytoliths are reported to be more resistant than associated redundant phytoliths (Fredlund & Tieszen, 1997; Albert et al., 2006; Cabanes et al., 2011).

Opal phytoliths deposited through fire represent a special case. Because of the relatively high melting point of opal, most phytoliths are unaffected by heating up to  $800^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  (Runge 1998), although thin phytoliths might start melting at  $600^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  (Brochier, 2002). Siliceous glasses will start forming between 900 and  $1000^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  (Brochier, 2002), unless compounds which can lower the melting temperatures, such as sodium carbonates, are present (Canti, 2003). However, temperatures also appear to vary according to plant taxa and organ (Wu et al., 2012). In some cases, phytoliths present a blackish coating (Fig. 4A) resulting from the combustion of the organic tissues that surrounded them. Occurrences of millimetre- to centimetre-sized lumps of vesicular glassy slag derived from phytoliths by heating has also been observed (Canti, 2003; Devos et al., 2009). Molten phytoliths appear as deformed disarticulated particles (Fig. 4B), molten silica skeletons, droplets (Fig. 4C) or silica glass (Fig. 4D). They can remain whitish or turn blackish. Autofluorescence under UV and blue light has been reported by several authors (Gebhardt & Langohr, 1999; Devos et al., 2009).

# 2.5 Inventorying

The shape of opal phytoliths varies widely. Stoops (2003) was the first to elaborate a two-dimensional analytical and descriptive system of phytoliths in soil thin sections. He proposed a series of two-dimensional descriptors classifying phytoliths as angular (e.g., square, rectangular, polyhedral) or rounded (e.g., circular, oval). However, this system does not account for the huge morphological diversity of opal phytoliths that can be of taxonomical relevance. Based on modern plant reference material, different classification systems can be developed, such as monocot versus eudicot plants (Piperno, 1988) or inflorescence versus bark phytoliths (Albert et al., 2006). In relation to the analysis of soil thin sections, one of the most practical systems has been proposed by Runge (1999).

It consists of an open system comprising seven broad morphological categories. Each of these can be further subdivided into as much subcategories as needed. It makes the classification system flexible and as such easily applicable to almost all geographical and ecological zones (Mercader et al., 2000; Vrydaghs et al., 2004; Devos et al., 2009).

Phytoliths being plant microfossils, one concern of studies of phytoliths in soil profiles is to establish a correlation between vertical changes in phytolith inventory and changes in the corresponding vegetation cover through time (Lu et al., 2007; Golyeva, 2008; Evett & Bartolome, 2013). However, the palaeoenvironmental relevancy of each distribution pattern differs, the isolate pattern being a non-local or regional record whilst the articulate pattern composes a local one. Hence, the study of vertical changes needs to fully consider distribution patterns.

# 3. Diatoms

Diatoms are eukaryotic unicellular algae with an external skeleton of opal (frustules). The frustules, occurring exclusively as groundmass components, are transparent, colourless and optically isotropic, with high negative relief and distinct symmetrical ribbing (Fig. 5).

Diatoms are found on all continents, living in soils (Schuttler & Weaver, 1986; Van de Vijver & Beyens, 1998), peat (Kokfeld et al., 2009), lakes, rivers and marine environments (Clarke, 2003; Round et al., 2007). The frustules, with a size of  $5 - 100\mu \mathrm{m}$ , exhibit a sieve pore-like surface morphology that is regularly spaced on the valve surface. They may have either a bilateral or a radial symmetry (Fig. 6). The latter occurs only in marine environments and, when found in soils, is thus inherited from the parent material (Clarke, 2003; Round et al., 2007). In acid conditions, the frustules are well preserved and

FIGURE 6 Abundant diatom frustules, both with radial symmetry and with bilateral symmetry, in a paddy soil (Philippines; Ghent University archive) (PPL). Image by G. Stoops.

can be used as indicators of past environmental conditions. As they have the potential to reach high levels of productivity, diatoms exert an important control on the biogeochemical silica cycle in soil (Sommer et al., 2013; Puppe et al., 2016). The species composition of diatom assemblages can indicate the extent of soil hydromorphism, allowing a distinction between soils with periodical water flooding, submerged soil and alluvial deposits (Golyeva, 2000, 2001, 2008). The expansion and contraction of large lakes in low-relief continental environments can result in deposition of diatomaceous sediments over large areas and then expose them to pedogenic processes (Clarke, 2003). Diatoms, e.g., in excrements of herbivores, can be important for the interpretation of archaeological materials (Verleyen et al., 2017).

# 4. Sponge Spicules

Sponge spicules are cylindrical siliceous bodies with a small central channel (Bullock et al., 1985). The latter serves as the main diagnostic feature and distinguishes them from phytoliths (Drees et al., 1989). Siliceous sponges are colourless and isotropic (Fig. 7) and typically have a smooth surface. Spicules are generally found in the groundmass but can also occur as infillings (Stoops et al., 2001).

Sponge spicules are common components of marine, lacustrine (Harrison, 1988) and fluvial deposits (Chauvel et al., 1996), but they are also found in marshland (Volkmer-Ribeiro, 1992) and waterlogged soils (Smithson, 1959; Schwandes & Collins, 1994), as well as in other types of soils (e.g., Wilding & Drees, 1968). They have been found to date in the soils of all continents except Antarctica. In soils, most spicules are derived freshwater sponges, which produce much smaller spicules  $(10 - 500\mu \mathrm{m})$  (Ricciardi & Reiswig, 1993)

than marine sponges (Clarke, 2003). Khangarot and Wilding (1973) observed sponge spicules in the  $20 - 50\mu \mathrm{m}$  particle size fraction of terrace deposits, confirming the aquatic origin of the soil parent materials. Stoops et al. (2001) observed spicules in pedons within the spray zone of the Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe (Fig. 8), derived from sponges growing on wet trees and rocks. Spicule-rich sediments were reported by Chauvel et al. (1996) for rivers in Amazonia that have extremely low dissolved silica contents. Sponge spicules represent the least soluble form of biogenic silica. They are therefore very resistant in soil environments and can be transported over large distances by water and wind. Their abundance in a soil sample may indicate the occurrence, duration and intensity of floods, for example in soils on alluvial deposits (Golyeva, 2008). Their interpretation in archaeological contexts is discussed by Vrydaghs (2017).

# 5. Testate Amoebae

Testate amoebae (Protista) are eukaryotic unicellular organisms occurring abundantly in freshwater and estuarine environments, peatlands (Bobrov et al., 1999; Lamentowicz

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/5c6931f0-ad82-457c-9a00-ad7594673b38/4897715fe6bb08d2046b185321c590e0909f49336e6aed1b1f410e0ba440e58c.jpg)  
FIGURE 8 Sponge spicules in a soil within the spray zone of the Victoria Falls (Zimbabwe; Ghent University archive) (PPL). Image by G. Stoops.

et al., 2007), and soils from the tropics to polar areas (e.g., Foissner, 1987, 1999). They produce an organic shell (test) on which other components can be adhered (agglutinated). The agglutinated material can consist of mineral particles that are present in the environment (xenosomic taxa) or calcareous or siliceous platelets produced by the amoebae (idiosomic taxa) (Meisterfeld, 2002a, 2002b). Most xenosomic testate amoebae have larger and heavier shells  $(60\mu \mathrm{m})$  than idiosomic individuals  $(30\mu \mathrm{m})$  (Meisterfeld, 2002a, 2002b). Siliceous scales produced by idiosomic testate amoebae are formed from silica occurring in solution. The scales are very small  $(10\mu \mathrm{m})$  and thin  $(1\mu \mathrm{m})$  and probably dissolve readily in soil solutions (Aoki et al., 2007). Terrestrial testate amoebae occur mainly in organic layers, especially in Of and Oh horizons, and their abundance decreases downward towards the underlying mineral soil horizons (Kaczorek, 2009; Ehrmann et. al., 2012). They are one of the very first colonisers of newly exposed soil substrates (Wanner et al., 2008; Puppe et al., 2016). They can build up populations of some 100 million individuals per square metres within a few months, facilitating plant succession (Hodkinson et al., 2002; Wanner & Xylander, 2005).

In soil thin sections, a distinction can be made between testate amoeba shells composed of self-synthesised silica platelets (idiosomic) and those covered with extraneous material (xenosomic) (Fig. 9), but identification at the species level is in most cases impossible, because the shell opening (pseudostome) of the amoebae, important for determination, is not always visible. Best observation results for unstained samples were obtained using dark field or phase contrast microscopy (Ehrmann et al., 2012).

# 6. Radiolaria

Radiolaria are single-celled marine planktonic protozoa that secrete an opal skeleton composed of a number of architectural elements (radial spicules, internal bars, external spines) that are joined together to form regular symmetrical structures. The skeletons are usually smaller than  $2\mathrm{mm}$  and commonly between 100 and  $250\mu \mathrm{m}$  in diameter. Radiolaria can be solitary and colonial, the latter producing centimetre- to metre-sized aggregates (Flügel, 2004). Radiolaria are found exclusively in marine sediments, proving some information about the nature of soil parent materials (Clarke, 2003; Stoops, 2003).

# 7. Conclusions

Among biogenic siliceous features, mainly phytoliths have received attention in micromorphological studies, mainly through analysis of archaeological materials. It has been shown that phytolith analysis using soil thin sections can yield valuable information about taphonomy and local to regional changes in vegetation. Development of diatom analysis using soil thin sections proves to be much more complex, as taxonomical identification of this biogenic opal is much more complex than for phytoliths.

# 1. Introduction

This chapter deals with micromorphological features of silicate neoformation in soil environments, covering the three silicate mineral groups whose formation in soils has most widely been investigated using microscopic and submicroscopic techniques. The nature of crystalline and amorphous  $\mathrm{SiO}_2$  phases is discussed elsewhere (Gutiérrez-Castorena, 2018). Micromorphological features of the neoformation of clays other than sepiolite and palygorskite have mainly been described for weathering contexts with leaching of released elements, whose discussion is beyond the scope of this chapter.

Occurrences in present soil environments are covered by this chapter, as well as those attributed explicitly to past processes of pedogenesis or near-surface diagenesis. Many relevant petrographical studies of silicate neoformation in various other diagenetic settings are available, but they are not considered here. Some information about occurrences as groundmass components inherited from the parent material is included, because a distinction between inherited and pedogenic phases is often important. Microscopic and submicroscopic features receive nearly equal attention in this review, reflecting the nature of available micromorphological data.

# 2. Sepiolite and Palygorskite

Sepiolite  $(\mathrm{Mg_4Si_6O_{15}(OH)_2\cdot 6H_2O})$  and palygorskite  $(\mathrm{(Mg,Al)_2Si_4O_{10}(OH)\cdot 4H_2O})$  are common constituents of soils in arid and semiarid regions, where they occur as pedogenic or inherited phases (e.g., Singer, 1989, 2002). Palygorskite is often described as attapulgite, especially in older publications, but the latter is not the correct mineral name (see Bailey et al., 1971).

# 2.1 Thin Section Studies

Optical properties of sepiolite and palygorskite are very similar (e.g., Fleischer et al., 1984). Both are length-slow, with (nearly) straight extinction and with a birefringence of about 0.010, which is significantly lower than that of smectite and other 2:1 phyllosilicate minerals. Only the lower refractive indices of sepiolite are a possible criterion for distinction between sepiolite and palygorskite. Selective staining of sepiolite with methyl orange, leaving palygorskite unaffected, is an option (Mifsud et al., 1979), but this method has only rarely been applied. It has only been used to reveal sepiolite distribution patterns in hand specimens (e.g., Hay & Wiggins, 1980; Blank & Fosberg, 1991; Francis et al., 2013), which is complicated by the observation that magnesium smectites can become stained as well (Hay & Wiggins, 1980; Hay et al., 1986). Another approach is element mapping of uncovered thin sections, which can be translated into relative distribution patterns of sepiolite and palygorskite (Cuadros et al., 2016).

Sepiolite and palygorskite are generally difficult to recognise as groundmass components because of their low birefringence, the random orientation of elongated particles and the common masking effect of associated micritic carbonates. In some formations, they are only clearly observed in carbonate depletion hypoco coatings (Fig. 1A and B; see also Mees & Van Ranst, 2011). Vanden Heuvel (1966) reports stipple-speckled and granostriated b-fabrics for sepiolite- and palygorskite-bearing samples, revealed after acid treatment of uncovered thin sections. Similar b-fabrics are recognised for noncalcareous materials (e.g., Francis et al., 2012, 2013) (Fig. 1C). The b-fabric of palygorskite-rich duricrusts is mainly mosaic-speckled (Stahr et al., 2000; Sauer et al., 2015). The same deposits also show granostriation, related by the authors to the pressure exerted during intergranular crystallisation and assumed to have resulted in

an increase of the spacing between the coarse grains of the groundmass (Stahr et al., 2000). Striated b-fabrics are more likely to develop by wetting and drying (Armenteros et al., 1995). Synsedimentary sepiolite-rich layers that are part of the parent material have been recognised by penecontemporaneous cracking and deformation (Hay et al., 1986) and by the presence of layering and unistrial b-fabrics (Mees, 2002) (Fig. 1D). Sepiolite aggregates (intraclasts) can be part of the groundmass, but the manner and degree of transport are not always certain (Khoury et al., 1982; Hay et al., 1986). Inherited palygorskite aggregates in a microcrystalline gypsum matrix have also been described (Porta & Herrero, 1990). Silicate dissolution features in horizons with palygorskite or sepiolite indicate that silica (and aluminium) is derived from a local source (Monger & Daugherty, 1991). Zones with higher interference colours in a palygorskite groundmass have been interpreted as recording transformation of palygorskite to smectite (Sauer et al., 2015).

Pedofeatures include coatings with low, high or varying degrees of alignment of the clay particles parallel to the covered surface (Silva et al., 1965; Singer & Norrish, 1974; Brewer, 1976; Kapur et al., 1993; Mees, 1999; Sauer et al., 2015). Authigenic silicate formation within the pore system is evident for (layered) coatings with authigenic carbonates and that are formed in horizontal planar voids (Mees & Van Ranst, 2011) (Fig. 2). This can also be said for a rare example of palygorskite fibres that are formed perpendicular to the sides of detrital mineral grains (Jenkins, 1981), which has also been observed by SEM (e.g., Robins et al., 2012, 2014). Coatings surrounding individual sand grains (Achyuthan, 2003) are not necessarily formed in situ. In soils with sepiolite or palygorskite as part of the groundmass, coatings can be predominantly illuvial, based on criteria such as strong similarities between coating and micromass material (Mees & Van Ranst, 2011) (Fig. 3A).

The coatings can be part of compound pedofeatures, such as palygorskite coatings with associated iron oxide hypocoatings (Silva et al., 1965), non-palygorskitic illuvial clay (Kapur et al., 1993) or loose calcite infillings (Mees & Van Ranst, 2011), recording changes in soil conditions (Fig. 3B). This was already noted by Beattie and Haldane (1958), for palygorskite coatings with associated quartz-kaolinite and manganese oxides, in a study that apparently did not involve micromorphological observations. Coatings continuing along the sides of carbonate nodules document a difference in timing between carbonate enrichment and silicate neoformation (Watts, 1980). The formation of palygorskite coatings has also been reported to post-date the partial filling of channels by mechanically transported carbonate grains (Becq-Giraudon & Freytet, 1976; Freytet & Plaziat, 1982). Sepiolite coatings composed of relatively large crystals oriented perpendicular to the surface of fine-grained sepiolite aggregates have been described as recrystallisation features (Hay et al., 1986). Khoury et al. (1982) describe similar features as infillings of circumgranular desiccation cracks. The presence of mineral grains as inclusions in sepiolite-rich pendents has been interpreted as an indication for sepiolite

formation by pressure solution (Brock & Buck, 2005). Palygorskite and sepiolite can occur as part of infillings composed of palygorskite/sepiolite aggregates and mineral grains with palygorskite/sepiolite coatings (Vanden Heuvel, 1966; Kautz & Porada, 1976; Mees, 1999) (Fig. 3C). For the site studied by Vanden Heuvel (1966), all occurrences of fibrous clays in pores, including coatings along the sides of the pores, are assumed to be related to residual enrichment by carbonate dissolution of the palygorskite- or sepiolite-bearing groundmass. Another aspect of carbonate depletion is the possible superposition of porostriation in response to later stress (Mees & Van Ranst, 2011). Palygorskite along cracks in certain schists and granites has been described as a weathering product, progressively replacing the rock and being replaced in turn by calcite (Millot et al., 1977; Paquet, 1983; Wang et al., 1994).

The coatings can become fragmented, producing clustered to isolated fragments, including groups of aligned elongated fragments (Mees & Van Ranst, 2011). Fragments of coatings can be reworked along the soil surface, as illustrated by the occurrence of

fragments of sepiolite coatings in deposits overlying the formation from which they are derived (Mees, 1999; Mees & Van Ranst, 2011) (Fig. 3D).

Possible nodules include aggregates composed of micritic carbonates and palygorskite (Alonso-Zarza & Silva, 2002) or sepiolite (Hay & Wiggins, 1980; Francis et al., 2013), both at least partly with concentric internal fabrics (see also Robins et al., 2015). For these concentric patterns, Francis et al. (2013) invoke a role of organic compounds, referring to the radial arrangement of enclosed elongated calcite crystals, whereas Robins et al. (2015) propose a model including pressure dissolution of detrital cores and deposition of illuvial or authigenic palygorskite/sepiolite in the created circumgranular space (see also Robins et al., 2012). Palygorskite nodules, surrounded by sparitic carbonate coatings, have been described for a Cenozoic palaeosoil (Freytet & Plaziat, 1982; Freytet & Verrecchia, 2002). Some nodular sepiolite occurrences have been interpreted as parts where sepiolite-rich formations have been protected from dolomitisation (Stoessell & Hay, 1978). Nahon et al. (1975) describe domains of neoformed palygorskite, formed at the expense of palygorskite-rich marls with a unistrial to crystallitic b-fabric.

Bustillo and García Romero (2003) describe relict fibrous textures in silcretes, inherited from palygorskite-bearing calcretes and possibly enhanced by sepiolite neoformation. Silicification of sepiolite deposits can be marked by the inheritance of a striated b-fabric and a granular microstructure (Bustillo & Alonso-Zarza, 2007). The lack of disturbance of the orientation of palygorskite particles around calcite aggregates in horizons with carbonate enrichment has been seen as an indication that a replacement reaction is involved (Nahon et al., 1975).

# 2.2 Transmission Electron Microscopy

TEM observations of dried suspensions have often been used to detect or confirm the presence of palygorskite or sepiolite, based on the typical fibrous morphology of these minerals (e.g., Yaalon, 1955; Barshad et al., 1956; Elgabaly, 1962; Elgabaly & Khadr, 1962; Al-Rawi & Sys, 1967; Altaie et al., 1969; Abtahi, 1977; Viani et al., 1983; Güzel & Wilson, 1985; Heidari et al., 2008; Fraser et al., 2016). It can therefore also be used to determine relative abundances of these minerals (e.g., Abtahi, 1980; Abtahi et al., 1980; Shadfan et al., 1985), although the good imaging characteristics of fibrous particles may lead to an overestimation of their concentration (Hillier & Pharande, 2008). Some caution is always needed in TEM identification of palygorskite and sepiolite, as various other clay minerals may have a fibrous morphology. Phyllosilicates that may be confused with palygorskite or sepiolite in TEM (or SEM) images include nontronite, hectorite and chrysotile, as well as halloysite and imogolite in some cases (see e.g., Bates, 1952, 1958; Beutelspacher & van der Marel, 1968; Grim, 1968; Gard, 1971; Sudo et al., 1981). More conclusive identification during TEM investigations is made possible by element analysis (EDS) and especially by electron diffraction analysis.

Some early studies suggested a difference in morphology between sepiolite and palygorskite fibres, for example with a greater width/thickness ratio for sepiolite particles

(Bates, 1958; Grim, 1968; Martin Vivaldi & Robertson, 1971), which would allow an easy distinction between these two related phases. However, this has not been confirmed by the many subsequent TEM studies of these minerals (see also García-Romero & Suárez, 2013). A relationship between fibre length and iron content has been suggested for both palygorskite and sepiolite, with shorter lengths for Fe-rich varieties (Weaver & Pollard, 1973; Zelazny & Calhoun, 1977), again with little subsequent confirmation.

Large well-developed or well-preserved palygorskite crystals are most likely to be inherited (Singer, 1971; Mashhady et al., 1980), although crystals of this type have also been interpreted as authigenic (Soong, 1992; Khademi & Mermut, 1998). Other studies found no difference in morphology between inherited and neoformed fibrous clays (Mackenzie et al., 1984). Vertical or lateral variations in size and shape have been used to assess variations in degree of weathering (Bigham et al., 1980; Shadfan & Dixon, 1984; Botha & Hughes, 1992) or transport (Botha & Hughes, 1992; Khademi & Mermut, 1998; Hojati et al., 2013), whereby both processes are considered to be responsible for the breakdown of the fibrous particles. Alteration during soil development has also been documented by TEM analyses for palaeosols in loess deposits (Coudé-Gaussen et al., 1984).

TEM studies provide evidence of sepiolite or palygorskite formation by transformation of other clay minerals, by documenting the development of fibres along the edge of platy particles (Heysteck & Schmidt, 1953; Trauth, 1977; Vogt & Larqué, 1998; Kaplan et al., 2014). Other types of precursors include opaline material (Blank & Fosberg, 1991) and unidentified spherical aggregates (Martin de Vidales et al., 1987). A relationship between palygorskite formation and calcite dissolution has also been suggested (Bustillo & García Romero, 2003). TEM observations of replacement of palygorskite or sepiolite by another phase are reported by Vogt and Larqué (1998), who illustrate the replacement of sepiolite by opal.

# 2.3 Scanning Electron Microscopy

SEM analysis of soils with fibrous clays is partly used with the same purpose as TEM analysis of suspensions, but it has the added advantage of providing information about their mode of occurrence within the soil. Similar results were obtained by TEM analysis of replicas of undisturbed samples before SEM became widely available (Silva et al., 1965; Beattie, 1970; Alonso & Benayas, 1972; Singer & Norrish, 1974). TEM analysis of ultrathin sections is another alternative (Khademi & Mermut, 1999), but this has only rarely been used for the study of fibrous clays. In SEM studies of calcareous materials, the quality of observations is improved by acid treatment of the sample surface (e.g., Yaalon & Wieder, 1976; Blank & Fosberg, 1991). Another approach is the removal of the resin in thin sections by low-temperature ashing (Jenkins, 1981). SEM analysis can obviously also be done for dried suspensions, for which spray drying was advocated in an early study by Bohor and Hughes (1971) (see also Hughes & Bohor, 1970).

In most SEM studies, the fibrous morphology of sepiolite and palygorskite is illustrated, as in nearly all papers that are cited in this section. One exception is sepiolite coatings with a non-fibrous surface morphology in phreatic calcretes (Arakel & McConchie, 1982). Fibre development has been related to bacterial activity according to Folk and Rasbury (2007), referring to the presence of spherical bodies at the tip of fibres and to the occurrence of fibres that are composed entirely of a string of spheres.

For undisturbed samples, the delicate morphology of the fibres has been cited as an indication of a lack of transport (e.g., Schwaighofer, 1980; Blank & Fosberg, 1991). The presence of spherical aggregates of palygorskite particles has been interpreted in the same manner (Yaalon & Wieder, 1976). Similar spherical aggregates, composed of sepiolite, are described by Gehring et al. (1995), who relate their formation to conditions with alternating supersaturation and undersaturation. Palygorskite aggregates with broken and deformed fibres along the surface and with indications of compaction in the outer parts can be particles that have been subjected to eolian transport (Coudé-Gaussen & Blanc, 1985; Coudé-Gaussen, 1987, 1991). In these studies of eolian material, the protective effect of the felt-like surface layer of the aggregates is pointed out.

The presence of palygorskite or sepiolite fibres on the surface of pedogenic or authigenic minerals is a strong indication of silicate neoformation in soil environments or during diagenesis (Fig. 4). This was first proposed for palygorskite covering pedogenic gypsum (Eswaran & Barzanji, 1974; Abtahi et al., 1980) and subsequently for palygorskite or sepiolite on dolomite (e.g., Anand et al., 1997; Pimentel, 2002; Xie et al., 2013), calcite (e.g., Kapur et al., 1987; Khademi & Mermut, 1998; Kaplan et al., 2014) and halite (Hojati

et al., 2010). An illuvial origin is nevertheless proposed for some occurrences of this type (Khademi & Mermut, 1999). Fibres that are oriented more or less perpendicular to a ped or grain surface are most unambiguously non-illuvial (Weaver & Beck, 1977; Monger & Daugherty, 1991; Singer et al., 1995; Dhir et al., 2004; Owliaie et al., 2006). Occurrences of fibres bridging the space between grains and aggregates suggest development from pore solutions that formed a meniscus in vadose conditions (e.g., Long et al., 1997; Colson et al., 1998; Kaplan et al., 2014), although palygorskite/sepiolite formation in a meniscus composed of microbial organic deposits has also been proposed (Miller & James, 2012). For water-deposited bridging accumulations, illuvial transport cannot be entirely excluded. This is also the case for films or coatings of delicately interwoven fibres on the surface of peds or grains, which are generally considered to be authigenic (Hassouba & Shaw, 1980; Watts, 1980; Verrecchia & Le Coustumer, 1996; Dhir et al., 2004). Beattie (1970), using replica-TEM, considered purity, discontinuity, a relatively large crystal size and juxtaposition on illuvial clay coatings as criteria for identifying palygorskite on ped surfaces as neoformed (see also Halitim et al., 1983a). The parallel alignment of palygorskite fibres is another criterion for authigenesis rather than iluviation (Nahon et al., 1975). In one palaeosoil study, the irregular SEM morphology of palygorskite coatings has been related to the non-planar form of the constituent crystals (Freytet & Plaziat, 1982).

Like TEM analyses, SEM studies have documented the transformation of other clay minerals to palygorskite or sepiolite (Bachman & Machette, 1977; Khoury et al., 1982; Pozo & Casas, 1999; Hillier & Pharande, 2008; Kadir & Eren, 2008; Xie et al., 2013; Kaplan et al., 2014). A similar relationship is deduced for sepiolite fibres emanating from opaline material in nodules (Blank & Fosberg, 1991). Indications for palygorskite formation by the coalescence of opal spheres have also been reported (Weaver & Beck, 1977).

SEM images have suggested a relationship between the formation of palygorskite or sepiolite and the dissolution of the material they surround, such as quartz (Halitim et al., 1983b; Colson et al., 1998; Francis et al., 2012), calcite (Courty et al., 1987) and dolomite (Kadir et al., 2010). A relationship with associated calcite formation and quartz dissolution has also been suggested (Halitim et al., 1983a). An alternative explanation for the formation of palygorskite or sepiolite surrounding mineral grains is that the latter have acted as nucleation sites (Morras et al., 1982; Pérez-Rodriguez et al., 1990). Whether transformation or nucleation is involved cannot always be determined (Rodas et al., 1994). The sides of sand grains have also been considered to be sites where water preferentially circulates or resides (Sancho et al., 1992; Verrecchia & Le Coustumer, 1996). Epitaxial growth has also been suggested, for palygorskite on hornblende (Eswaran & Barzanji, 1974). A different type of relationship has been proposed for palygorskite covering gypsum crystals, whereby palygorskite formation is thought to have been favoured by increased magnesium/calcium ratios in soil solutions during gypsum formation (Khormali & Abtahi, 2003; Farpoor & Krouse, 2008).

Transformation of sepiolite or palygorskite to other materials has been documented in some studies. Reaction products include other clay minerals (Singer et al., 1995) and non-pseudomorphic fibrous opal (Bustillo, 1995; Bustillo & Bustillo, 2000). Opal

formed by silicification of sepiolite deposits has been described as a mass of discrete pseudomorphic fibres that is subsequently transformed to aggregates of blades composed of joined fibres and finally to structureless opaline material (Bustillo & Alonso-Zarza, 2007).

# 3. Zeolites

Zeolites are quite rare in soil environments, occurring either as inherited components or as pedogenic minerals. The latter form nearly exclusively in saline alkaline soils, partly with volcanic parent materials (e.g., Ming & Boettinger, 2001).

Most zeolite minerals have a characteristic crystal morphology, which has been extensively documented for sedimentary and volcanic rocks (Mumpton & Ormsby, 1976; Gottardi & Galli, 1985). The morphology of zeolites in soil environments seems to be identical with that of zeolites formed in other settings (e.g., Ming & Mumpton, 1989) (Table 1; Fig. 5). Morphological studies of euhedral zeolite crystals, using thin sections or SEM observations, can therefore contribute to the identification of zeolite mineral species in soil samples (e.g., Allen & Jacob, 1983; Ping et al., 1988), although no identification of all phases appears to have been possible in some cases (e.g., Smale, 1968; Zarei et al., 1987, 1990). If a crystal morphology is recognised that is not clearly compatible with that of common soil zeolites (e.g., Brogowski et al., 1979, 1983; Verrecchia & Le Coustumer, 1996), the identification of those crystals as zeolites is doubtful. In addition to generally allowing mineral identification, micromorphological studies are also important for the recognition of associations and sequences (e.g., Renaut, 1993; Mees et al., 2005).

# 3.1 Thin Section Studies

Zeolites in soils can be groundmass components inherited from the parent material, occurring as single grains or as part of rock fragments (Stoops et al., 2001). Fracturing of

zeolite grains in this study (laumontite) reveals susceptibility to physical breakdown. The fragmented crystal aggregates with an assumed zeolite composition illustrated by Sauer and Zöller (2006) should also be considered to be part of the groundmass. Grain mount studies of the sand fraction have also been used for zeolite-bearing soils, documenting the occurrence of zeolitised plagioclase and kaolinitised zeolites in laumontite-bearing parent materials (Taylor et al., 1990). They also show the presence of iron oxide coatings on altered zeolite grains (Bhattacharyya et al., 1999), whose significance is

unclear. Reworked fragments of chabazite coatings, with aberrant crystal morphology, represent another type of zeolitic groundmass component (Alonso-Zarza et al., 2016).

Zeolite minerals are more commonly recognised in pores than as groundmass constituents (see Fig. 5). They can occur exclusively or preferentially in pores of specific types, providing information about the period of zeolite development, for example relative to the development of porosity by dissolution of feldspar grains (Dickinson & Grapes, 1997; Dickinson & Bleakley, 2005) or formation of planar voids (Mees et al., 2005). The recognition of zeolites in pores confirms that they are formed from solution rather than by direct transformation of clay minerals in the groundmass (Remy & Ferrell, 1989; Renaut, 1993); the latter has been suggested for some analcime occurrences observed in thin sections (e.g., Scott et al., 2008). Occurrences in pores that formed during subaerial exposure, particularly channels, generally indicate a pedogenic nature of the zeolites (Haesaerts et al., 1983; Renaut, 1993; Ashley & Driese, 2000; Yakimenko et al., 2004; Driese & Ashley, 2016). However, analcime coatings in root passages in Carboniferous lake margin deposits seem to have formed after burial rather than during soil development (Gall & Hyde, 1989). A non-pedogenic origin is also inferred for analcime infillings of mudcracks in Triassic lake sediments (Van Houten, 1962, 1964) and for laumontite coatings in Cretaceous palaeosols (Howe & Francis, 2005). In one study, analcime coatings that formed in a soil environment are considered to be partly illuvial, composed of transported silt-sized crystals (Ashley & Driese, 2000).

Pores with zeolite coatings can contain other pedogenic materials, such as illuvial or authigenic clay coatings, carbonate coatings or infillings and iron/manganese oxide coatings or hypocoatings (Hay, 1978; Renaut, 1993; Ashley & Driese, 2000; Mees et al., 2005; Owen et al., 2008; Beverly et al., 2014; Alonso-Zarza et al., 2016) (Fig. 6). They record sequences of pedogenic processes, which may be related to changes in palaeoenvironmental conditions in some cases. The possibility that these processes took place during overlapping or multiple periods should always be considered (e.g., Dickinson & Grapes, 1997; Dickinson & Bleakley, 2005).

For settings other than soil environments, zeolite formation during alteration of volcanic material has been extensively documented. Studies of the alteration of this type of material in soil-related environments include the work of Boekschoten et al. (1983), describing the transformation of volcanic glass to microcrystalline offretite and the development of analcime veins with epistilbite spherulites. Le Gal et al. (1999) describe zeolites associated with a gel that is formed by alteration of volcanic glass. Hay (1980) describes occurrences of zeolites in eolian tuffs that were altered along the land surface, largely based on thin section observations. Reported features include the relatively low authigenic mineral content of cavities formed by dissolution of nepheline, indicating that this process also contributed to zeolite formation in other parts of the deposits (Hay, 1980). Other papers by the same author about zeolite occurrences at the same location are less explicitly based on thin section observations (Hay, 1963, 1964) or they concern lake-margin or alluvial environments with intermittent exposure rather than stable soil environments (e.g., Hay, 1970). One buried alteration profile was recognised, for which

analcime-chabazite coprecipitation and later formation of natrolite and dawsonite could be deduced (Hay, 1970). Zeolites in continental sediments with volcanic intercalations, deposited in intermittently dry marsh environments, were also studied by Teruggi (1964), documenting various types of analcime occurrences, including coatings, infillings, and partially replacive aggregates.

An entirely different context in which thin section and SEM analyses have been applied to the study of zeolites is the investigation of soils on iron production waste (Sauer & Burghardt, 2006).

# 3.2 Transmission Electron Microscopy

TEM has only rarely been used for the study of zeolites in soils. Gorbunov and Bobrovitskiy (1973) mention that it allows mineral identification based on external morphology, illustrated by an unconvincing image for alluvial soils. The identification of fibrous material as zeolites in alluvial soils by Brogowski et al. (1983) is equally doubtful. The use of TEM is also mentioned or implied by Nørnberg and Dalsgaard (1985) and

Nørnberg (1990), who used electron diffraction analysis to confirm the recognition of inherited clinoptilolite-heulandite. The same methods were used in a study of a clay fraction that includes inherited mordenite (Kirkman, 1976), and in a study that indicates the presence of smectite as an alteration product of clinoptilolite in the upper part of a soil profile (Ming & Boettinger, 2001).

# 3.3 Scanning Electron Microscopy

SEM studies of inherited zeolites that are part of the groundmass provide evidence for their stability in certain environments, based on the presence of euhedral shapes and unweathered surfaces (Ming & Dixon, 1986). Pitted surfaces and rounding are indicative of chemical weathering, with variations between horizons (Taylor et al., 1990) or climate zones (Bhattacharyya et al., 1999), although roundness can also be related to transport of the grains (Taylor et al., 1990; Bhattacharyya et al., 1999). Weathering of inherited zeolites may result in the appearance of alteration products such as halloysite (Taylor et al., 1990). A difference in resistance against weathering relative to associated components such as volcanic glass has been revealed by SEM studies (Ming & Dixon, 1986). Jacob and Allen (1990) found that clinoptilolite occurs in the interior of inherited altered glass shards in subsurface horizons, where it is protected from weathering.

SEM studies of pedogenic zeolites include investigations of fractions obtained by mineral separation, whereby the euhedral nature of zeolite crystals is indicative of formation from soil solutions and the presence of dissolution features records instability in specific horizons (Spiers et al., 1984). In SEM studies of undisturbed fragments, indications of authigenesis again include a lack of corrosion (Gibson et al., 1983) as well as zeolite occurrences in pores (e.g., McFadden et al., 1987; Dickinson & Rosen, 2003; Inozemtsev & Targulian, 2010) (Fig. 7). Other studies have shown that quartz grains in contact with zeolites are partly corroded (Dickinson & Grapes, 1997) or that detrital sand grains in the same profile show dissolution features (Gibson et al., 1983), documenting a relationship between zeolite formation and the dissolution of other silicates. A difference in timing with opal-CT development, taking place at a later stage than zeolite formation, has also been noted (Huggett et al., 2005; Pozo et al., 2006). Renaut (1993) describes analcime mixed with clay in root casts, developed either as precipitates around roots or as infillings of moulds at a later stage. SEM and optical observations of altered volcanic material from Lanzarote suggest a contribution of zeolites to soil aggregate stability (Zarei et al., 1987).

Buch and Rose (1996) illustrate the morphology of euhedral K-feldspar, assumed to have formed by alteration of analcime that was part of the parent material. This transformation has been documented in various studies of non-pedogenic authigenic silicates related to conditions with higher salinities and alkalinities than those that favour zeolite formation.

# 4. Sodium Silicates

Sodium silicate minerals can form by evaporation of highly alkaline interstitial brines in near-surface horizons. The most common sodium silicates are magadiite, kenyaite and

kanemite. The morphology of individual crystals, recognised in SEM and TEM images, seems to be quite characteristic in soils or soil-related environments (Table 2). Spherulitic aggregates have been described for all three minerals (Rooney et al., 1969; Hay, 1970; Johan & Maglione, 1972; Maglione, 1976; Mees et al., 2005) (Fig. 8).

Kenyaite has been recognised in pores (Hay, 1970; Mees et al., 2005), associated with other authigenic silicate minerals that formed at an earlier stage (Mees et al., 2005), suggesting a late-stage pedogenic origin. Rooney et al. (1969) describe microscopic features of infillings of wide vertical cracks in playa deposits, composed of a fine-grained

magadiite mass that is crossed by veins with a spherulitic fabric and which encloses possible magadiite pseudomorphs after unidentified mineral grains.

Icole et al. (1983) mention the occurrence of enclosed organic material in tubular magadiite concretions that seem to have formed around roots. Sebag et al. (2001) report various textural features for layers, concretions and mineralised plant remains from the same region. Fabric units include massive microcrystalline magadiite, partly grading to more coarse-grained material toward pores, and void-filling phases such as spherulites and palisade-textured coatings, whereby all coarse-grained material is tentatively identified as kenyaite (Sebag et al., 1999, 2001).

Magadiite is replaced by silhydrite  $(\mathrm{Si}_3\mathrm{O}_6\cdot \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O})$  by leaching, producing more or less pseudomorphic aggregates (Gude & Sheppard, 1972). Similar patterns are reported for the partial replacement of spherulitic kenyaite by chalcedony (Hay, 1970). Maglione and Servant (1973) mention SEM observations that indicate the transformation of magadiite and kenyaite to quartz. The transformation of magadiite beds to chert layers is well documented for the Lake Magadi area (e.g., Hay, 1968), which may in part be related to leaching in soil environments. Sheppard and Gude (1969) illustrate rhodesite coatings  $(\mathrm{KHCaSi_8O_{19}.5H_2O})$  in cavities within microcrystalline magadiite that are formed by the alteration of volcanic rocks, without indications for magadiite-rhodesite replacement.

# 5. Conclusions

Micromorphological techniques have been widely applied to the study of silicate neoformation, both in the field of soil science and for the study of diagenetic processes in sedimentary geology. Their use has greatly contributed to the recognition of silicate mineral authigenesis in earth-surface conditions. Micromorphology also provides information about the transformation of authigenic silicates and their inherited counterparts. Electron microscopy has been most commonly used, as a technique that is

ideally suited for the study of submicroscopic particles. For palygorskite and sepiolite, this has led to an overrepresentation in the literature of SEM and TEM images that merely illustrate a fibrous particle morphology rather than textural features with genetic implications. Electron microscopy studies of zeolites and sodium silicates show a highly characteristic and invariable crystal morphology, which makes SEM and TEM important tools for their identification. Thin section studies of authigenic silicates and their inherited counterparts are rarer, but they invariably provide important information about the significance of their occurrence as groundmass components and pedofeatures.

# 1. Introduction

The precipitation of calcium carbonate is common in soils and regoliths and occurs in a variety of climatic settings, ranging from arid to subhumid and from warm to cold (e.g., Courty et al., 1994). It produces a wide variety of forms, from isolated crystals and discrete elementary features to continuous carbonate-rich horizons. The accumulation of carbonate in soils and regoliths through time may lead to the formation of differentiated profiles with thick carbonate-enriched horizons, especially in arid to Mediterranean environments.

The horizon of prominent carbonate accumulation, in the form of fine-grained precipitates, has been named a 'K' horizon (Gile et al., 1965), which usually corresponds to the calcic (Bkk) or petrocalic (Bkkm) horizons of Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 2014). Soils with calcic and petrocalic horizons are grouped with the Calcisols in the World Reference Base (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015). The term 'calcrete', widely used in the literature, has very different meanings depending on the chosen definition (see Wright, 2007; Alonso-Zarza & Wright, 2010). In its broader sense, calcrete designates near-surface, terrestrial accumulation of calcium carbonate, which occurs in a variety of forms, from powdery to highly indurated and from nodular to continuous. Aridisols, Vertisols, Mollisols and Alfisols (Soil Survey Staff, 1999) are the most typical soils containing indurated carbonate features (Wright & Tucker, 1991). In the classification of

palaeosols, calcretes are considered to be Aridisols (Retallack et al., 1993), Calcisols (Mack et al., 1993) or palaeo-Aridisols (Nettleton et al., 2000).

# 1.1 Carbonate Mineralogy

The precipitation and dissolution processes of calcium carbonate in soil are governed by the conventional equation:

$$
\mathrm {C a} ^ {+ +} + 2 \mathrm {H C O} _ {3} ^ {-} \leftrightarrow \mathrm {C a C O} _ {3} + \mathrm {C O} _ {2} + \mathrm {H} _ {2} \mathrm {O}
$$

However, this equation does not predict the mineralogy, morphology or crystal size of what will be formed. These parameters are closely linked to the presence of other ions and molecules in the environment and also depend on the biological activity involved in the precipitation of carbonate species.

The most common minerals of the ternary carbonate system  $\mathrm{CaCO_3 - MgCO_3 - FeCO_3}$ , which may precipitate in soil or sediment, represent a complex series of solid solutions and ordering states. Calcite, aragonite and vaterite are the three polymorphs of  $\mathrm{Ca(CO_3)}$ . Calcite (low-magnesium calcite) is the most abundant and the most thermodynamically stable mineral at surface conditions and forms the main part of the carbonate features discussed in this chapter. Aragonite is commonly found in shells of aquatic organisms, but it is rare in soil profiles because it gradually recrystallises into ordered calcite at earth-surface conditions. Aragonite has been observed in some calccrete profiles (Nahon et al., 1980; Watts, 1980; Milnes & Hutton, 1983) and as part of pendant coatings (Courty et al., 1994). Vaterite, which also mainly occurs in aquatic shells, has only rarely been identified in soils but is a common biogenic precipitate of soil microorganisms in liquid and solid growth media in laboratory studies (Lindemann et al., 2002; Braissant et al., 2003; Cacchio et al., 2003; Rodriguez-Navarro et al., 2007; Millo et al., 2012).

An important subgroup of the  $\mathrm{CaCO_3}$  minerals is the magnesian calcites. High magnesian calcite (HMC) contains between 11 and to  $19\mathrm{mol}\%$ $\mathrm{MgCO_3}$ ,  $\mathrm{Mg}$  ions being incorporated in a quite disordered way in the crystal lattice. Dolomite  $(\mathrm{CaMg}(\mathrm{CO}_3)_2)$  is a mineral whose mode of formation in surface environments is still poorly understood, since well-ordered stoichiometric dolomite has never been synthesised under earth-surface conditions, without biological and chemical mediation (Tribble et al., 1995; Sherman & Barak, 2000). In addition, only a few restricted sedimentary environments are considered as modern analogues for dolomite precipitation (see Last, 1990; Warren, 2000). In soil environments, high concentrations of dolomite and HMC have been observed in some calcretes and calcareous soils (Watts, 1980; Bui et al., 1990; El-Sayed et al., 1991; Milnes, 1992; Capo et al., 2000; Whipkey et al., 2002). Still, the vast majority of pedogenic carbonates consist of calcite, even those that formed in dolomitic deposits (Kraimer et al. 2005).

Siderite  $(\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CO}_3))$  occurs in hydromorphic soils (see Lindbo et al., 2010; Vepraskas et al., 2018), as xenotopic coatings on pore walls and as small pore infilling (Stoops, 1983). Iron can substitute for the cations in the crystal lattice of dolomite to give ankerite

(up to  $25\mathrm{mol}\%$ $\mathrm{FeCO_3}$ ). For sodium carbonates, the reader may refer to the chapter on salts and salts crusts (Mees & Tursina, 2018).

# 1.2 Microscopic Techniques

Carbonate minerals can easily be recognised in soil thin sections, as their birefringence is extreme resulting in upper-order creamy white interference colours. They are also characterised by high relief generally from strongly negative to strongly positive, depending upon their orientation. Details of the crystallographic and optical properties of the most common carbonate minerals are summarised in Table 1.

Most micromorphological analyses of thin sections are performed with a petrographic microscope. Because the optical properties of the various carbonate minerals are quite similar, additional techniques are needed for their identification; details about these techniques may be found in Stoops (2003).

In cathodoluminescence (CL) microscopy, calcite is either yellow, orange to red or dark blue to purple, depending mainly on the concentrations of activators (e.g.,  $\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}$ ) and quenchers (e.g.,  $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ ). A red to purple colour is more typical of dolomite. Aragonite may have yellow-green colour. CL microscopy is useful to distinguish calcite of different origins and generations and to reveal patterns in features affected by recrystallisation (see Wright & Peeters, 1989; Budd et al., 2002; Bajnóczi et al., 2006; Khormali et al., 2006; Violette et al., 2010; Mintz et al., 2011; Michel et al., 2013).

Fluorescence microscopy can give results that are similar to those of CL microscopy, but it has only been rarely applied to carbonate studies (Dravis & Yurewicz, 1985; Dravis, 1991). Soil carbonate generally gives a bluish colour in ultraviolet-oblique incident light (UV-OIL) and a yellow colour in blue OIL. The original fabrics of carbonate nodules or lithic fragments obliterated by later recrystallisations may become visible by fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescence and CL studies proved to be useful in distinguishing between pedogenic and geogenic calcite (Khormali et al., 2006).

Staining is a common technique for the differentiation of carbonate minerals (Dickson, 1965). Typical products are alizarine-red for staining calcite (red colour), alizarine-red and

Selective extraction of components from thin sections is sometimes necessary to separate similar constituents and to make the masked b-fabric visible, for example a striated b-fabric masked by a calcitic crystallitic one. For the extraction procedure, weak HCl is used on uncovered thin sections (Wilding & Drees, 1990).

Moreover, submicroscopic techniques (SEM, TEM) are commonly used in the study of calcitic features, frequently in combination with thin section observations (James, 1972; Freytet, 1973; Freytet & Plaziat, 1982; Tucker & Wright, 1990; Kovda et al., 2003; Bajnóczi et al., 2006; Kuznetsova & Khokhlova, 2012).

# 1.3 Terminology

Geologists have long shown an interest in calcitic features in thin sections. A rich literature exists on diagenetic carbonate features in sedimentary petrology (e.g., Dunham, 1969a, 1969b; Walls et al., 1973; Harrison & Steinen, 1978; Adams, 1980; Freytet & Plaziat, 1982; Esteban & Klappa, 1983; James & Choquette, 1984; Harwood, 1988). A comprehensive overview of continental calcitic features was presented by Reeves (1976). In addition, a number of soil scientists who have studied microscopically discrete calcitic features in soils have proposed a classification of those features (Blokhuis et al., 1969; Sehgal & Stoops, 1972; Wieder & Yaalon, 1974; Bal, 1975a, 1975b; Ruellan et al., 1979; Verrecchia, 1987; Wright, 1990; Becze-Deak et al., 1997; Zamanian et al., 2016), including a classification developed for the discussion of carbon sequestration by pedogenic carbonates (Monger et al., 2015). Other accounts of the genesis and properties of petrocalic horizon and calccrete profiles are given by Gile et al. (1966), Elloy and Thomas (1981), Braithwaite (1983), Goudie (1983), Esteban and Klappa (1983), Verrecchia and Freytet (1987), Wright and Tucker (1991) and Alonso-Zarza and Tanner (2010).

For general descriptive terms of pedofeatures, the reader is referred to Bullock et al. (1985) and Stoops (2003). Some of the terms and concepts used for pedogenic calcitic features are taken from sedimentary petrography. These terms include micrite (crystal size  $< 4\mu \mathrm{m}$  in diameter, seen but not readily measured under the optical microscope), microsparite  $(5 - 20\mu \mathrm{m})$  and sparite  $(>20\mu \mathrm{m})$  (Folk, 1962; Chilingar et al., 1965). Isolated pedogenic crystals are considered as crystalline pedofeatures only when larger than  $20~{\mu\mathrm{m}}$ , while smaller crystals are part of the micromass.

# 2. Groundmass

# 2.1 Coarse Fraction

Different groups of coarse particles can be distinguished in the groundmass: single mineral grains, compound mineral grains or rock fragments, inorganic residues of biological origin and anthropogenic materials.

Among mineral grains and rock fragments, limestone fragments, or calcite inherited from the parent material, should not be confused with pedogenic nodules or other types of carbonate pedofeatures. Different studies tried to use the morphology of calcite to discriminate between lithogenic (inherited from the parent rock) and pedogenic (formed in the soil itself) carbonates (e.g., Sehgal & Stoops, 1972; Tandon & Narayan, 1981; West et al., 1988; Kraimer & Monger, 2009). Sehgal and Stoops (1972) described sand-size inherited calcite crystals in soil profiles of the Indo-Gangetic alluvial plain, as the grains exhibit a rounded shape, probably linked to abrasion during transport, and a wavy extinction suggesting their origin from metamorphic rock.

Inorganic residues of biological origin include remains of bivalves, such as oyster (Ostreidae), mussel (e.g., Mytilus edulis) and clam (e.g., Mercenaria mercenaria and Mya arenaria). These organisms typically have substantial shells characterised by dense thicknesses of interwoven fibrous crystallites with high-order interference colours (Fig. 1A and B), which can be released as isolated needle-fibre crystals by weathering (Villagran & Poch, 2014). Gastropods also have thick shells in some cases, for example

cockle (Cerastoderma edule) and limpet (e.g., Patella vulgata, Fig. 1C), but this group also contains snails, producing thinner shells (Fig. 1D) and operculi, as well as arionid slugs, which produce granules (see Section 3.7.3).

Another group of calcareous coarse material of biological origin is represented by birds' eggshells. The shells consist of columnar calcite crystals (known as the 'palisade layer') arranged roughly at right angles to the eggshell surface (Keepax, 1981; Board, 1982). These form after an initial growth of aragonite crystals in a radial pattern producing a layer of crude  $50 - 75\mu \mathrm{m}$  spherules known as mammillary knobs, which line the innermost part of the shell (Halstead, 1974). The palisade layer consists of crystals running the full thickness of the shell, mostly aligned perpendicular to the surface (Fig. 2). Consequently, in cross-polarised light, they all enter extinction within about  $20^{\circ}$  of the vertical position. Eggshell fragments can be rapidly spotted in thin sections by holding the whole slide against a dark background and viewing obliquely. The eggshell stands out as a dense white line.

# 2.2 Micromass

Calcareous soils generally have a high carbonate content of the micromass, occurring in the form of micritic or microsparitic crystals. The b-fabric is crystallitic (Bullock et al., 1985), due to the bright small punctuations caused by the optical anisotropy of the small crystals. This fabric has also been termed K-fabric (Gile et al., 1965), cystic plasmic fabric (Brewer, 1964; Sehgal & Stoops, 1972), calciasepic (Jongerius & Rutherford, 1979) and calcitic-crystallitic b-fabric (Stoops, 2003) (Fig. 3). When not inherited from sedimentary parent material, this fabric can develop in soils when fine calcite crystals gradually precipitate in the clayey micromass and when the pore space between soil framework grains is progressively filled by precipitated silt- and clay-size pedogenic carbonate crystals (Wieder & Yaalon, 1974; Monger et al., 1991b).

# 3. Pedofeatures

# 3.1 Coatings

# 3.1.1 General Aspects

Void coatings exhibit a wide variety of size, shape and basic distribution of calcite crystals (Fig. 4). Most frequently, carbonate coatings are composed of grey or brown micrite (sometimes laminated), microsparite and less frequently sparite. The crystals can be equant, elongated prismatic or needle-shaped (Verrecchia & Verrecchia, 1994; Kemp, 1995; Bajnóczi & Kovács-Kis, 2006; Khormali et al., 2006; Cailleau et al., 2009b).

Carbonate coatings appear to have two main origins: (i) unrelated to biological activity, formed by evaporation or mechanical translocation, the latter with admixtures of non-carbonate material (Siesser, 1973; Hay & Wiggins, 1980), and (ii) related to biogenic activity, e.g., coatings consisting of microbial tubules or certain needle-fibre calcite types (Knox, 1977; Calvet & Julia, 1983; Wright, 1986; see Section 3.5).

# 3.1.2 Pendants

At all latitudes, pendants are frequently observed under the face of gravelly stony coarse material. They consist of conical deposits that radiate downward from the bottom surfaces of pebbles into the soil (Fig. 5). Pendants are composed of alternating irregular laminae of pedogenic calcium carbonate, which can be identified at the microscopic level. In sedimentary geology literature, they are named 'vadose gravitational cements'.

The pendants range from limpid to dark brown depending on the content of impurities, such as organic matter or iron oxides. The surface of the carbonate coatings runs roughly parallel to the lower clast surface on which they form, but there is a wide variety of surface irregularities, the outermost layers often presenting a columnar morphology (Courty et al., 1994). Pendants range in thickness from about a millimetre to a centimetre. The thickness of most of the observed coatings is of the order of one to a few millimetres (Chadwick et al., 1989; Courty et al., 1994; Treadwell-Steitz & McFadden,

2000; Khormali et al., 2006), but can be less than  $0.5\mathrm{mm}$  for coatings in Late Pleistocene and Holocene desert soils (Wang et al., 1996) or as thick as  $10 - 30\mathrm{mm}$  in older desert soils (Gile et al., 1966; Treadwell-Steitz & McFadden, 2000).

The calcitic pendants display a complex layering, which could result from sequential aggradation. Changes in crystal size, with alternating micritic and microsparitic laminae, have been recognised as the major factor causing the lamination (Chadwick et al., 1989), in addition to the common occurrence of dark rims that suggest organic and/or detrital enrichment. The lightest, limpid microlaminae of the coatings consist of relatively pure microsparitic calcite, loosely packed, with minor detrital content, whereas the dark ones are built up from micrite and include abundant organic and mineral impurities and traces of fungal hyphae (Courty et al., 1994). X-ray diffraction analyses have shown pendants to be composed mostly of calcite (Chadwick et al., 1989; Courty et al., 1994; Pustovoytov, 1998) even when they are formed on dolostone clasts (Kraimer et al., 2005). Chemical mapping has shown a substantial drop in magnesium concentration from dolostone to attached pendants. Chadwick et al. (1989) and Courty et al. (1994) also mention inclusions, such as quartz, feldspars, smectite, mica and kaolinite.

Ducloux et al. (1984) and Ducloux and Laouina (1989) showed that the genesis of the pendant is the result of an evolutionary mineralogical sequence involving different types of calcitic crystallisations: (i) randomly oriented, more or less complex, monocrystalline needles  $(1\mu \mathrm{m}$  width), (ii) heterogeneous polycrystalline needles of larger size  $(50\mu \mathrm{m})$  and (iii) sparitic rhombohedra. This succession is accompanied by changes in chemical composition, in particular with magnesium rates. Ducloux and Laouina (1989) showed also that the genesis of the pendants seems to be the result of different processes according to the climatic setting, involving the same mineralogical sequence. Only the polarity of these crystallisations is different. In a semiarid climate, the monocrystalline needles first develop along the contact with the bearing pebbles, followed by successive crystallisations toward the outside, creating an evolutionary mineralogical sequence with a centrifugal differentiation (Ducloux & Laouina, 1989). In that case, pendants correspond to an absolute accumulation of carbonate. In temperate climate, the evolutionary mineral sequence is inverted, the first crystallisations appearing in the lumen of the void and the subsequent crystallisations are formed closer to the pebble surface, representing centripetal differentiation (Ducloux et al., 1984). In this case, the pendant seems to be controlled by the progression of weathering during which, carbonate of the pebble is destabilised and not associated with a simple continuous carbonate accretion.

The fact that pendants do not always form like stalactites, in which the innermost laminae are the oldest and outermost laminae are the youngest, has been emphasised by Brock and Buck (2005). In some cases, void spaces at the clast-pendant contact, are sites of carbonate precipitation and are thus the location of the youngest laminae.

Depending on the crystal form and lamina morphology, it is possible to link the formation of the calcitic pendants to climatic changes and modifications of soil conditions through time (Dupuis et al., 1984; Chadwick et al., 1989; Courty et al., 1994). Light microlaminae, composed of pure calcium carbonate with well-formed and

parallel-oriented crystals, seem to be indicative of drier periods that were less favourable for biological activity (hotter in warm climates and colder in cool climates). The dark microlaminae with high content of detrital particles, and composed of less well-developed and more randomly oriented calcite crystals with fungal hyphae, presumably mark wetter periods characterised by activation of soil biota and amelioration of climatic conditions. Therefore, the light laminae may be of physicochemical origin, and the dark laminae may have formed through mediation of organisms. Accretion of successive calcitic layers that compose the pendant represents a stratigraphic sequence useful for dating soils and landforms (Blank & Fosberg, 1990; Pustovoytov, 2003; Sharp et al., 2003) and reconstruct palaeoenvironmental conditions (Courty et al., 1994; Pustovoytov, 1998, 2002).

# 3.1.3 Laminar and Lamellar Crusts

Macroscopically, laminar and lamellar crusts are finely laminated dense horizons located either at the top of calccrete profiles (along the surface or beneath a thin soil cover), interbedded within sedimentary deposits, or at the top of any type of rock substrate, including igneous and metamorphic rocks (Fig. 6A to C). At the microscopic scale, two types of crust, with different origins, are distinguished – laminar and lamellar crusts (Freytet & Verrecchia, 1989; Freytet et al., 1997).

Laminar crusts are composed of a succession of micritic to microsparitic light-coloured bands alternating with darker brown laminae (Fig. 6D and E). The dark colour of the latter is due to the presence of Fe and Mn oxides, organic matter and/or clays. The total thickness of the crusts ranges from a few millimetres to a few tens of centimetres. Spherulites are a very common feature of this type of crust. They are fibro-radial low-Mg calcite aggregates, which are about  $50~\mu \mathrm{m}$  in diameter (Fig. 6F) (Verrecchia et al., 1995; Zhou & Chafetz, 2009). The presence of growth structures exhibiting a columnar habit (Verrecchia, 1994) is a characteristic feature of the crusts (Fig. 6E). Detrital silt-sized grains  $(20 - 40\mu \mathrm{m})$ , which are commonly well-sorted, are abundant (Huerta et al., 2015). It has been proposed that microorganisms, such as cyanobacteria (Vogt, 1984; Verrecchia et al., 1995), control the formation of the laminae, based on the presence of spherulites (Fig. 6E) and columnar growth structures (Rabenhorst et al., 1991; Verrecchia, 1994, 2016; Zhou & Chafetz, 2009). Spherulites have been grown experimentally and their formation seems to be related to cyanobacterial mats often requiring direct light exposure, meaning they have to form at the calcrete-atmosphere interface (Verrecchia et al., 1995). Bacteria (Braissant et al., 2003), fungi (Verrecchia & Verrecchia, 1994) and lichens (Klappa, 1979b) may also either contribute to or alter the original laminar features. However, Mees (1999) observed calcitic spherulites along subhorizontal cracks within Quaternary palustrine deposits, implying possible development in conditions with no or limited light. Several authors also suggested that the formation of laminar crusts corresponds to the last stages of horizon development when the hydraulic conductivity of the soil is sharply reduced by cementation (Rabenhorst & Wilding, 1986; Brock & Buck, 2009).

Lamellar crusts have a less finely laminated fabric than laminar crusts, whereby the crust consists of layers that are a few millimetres to a few centimetres thick (Fig. 6G).

Millimetric tubular pores and alveolar septal structures are common, forming a spongelike fabric (fenestral fabric; Wright et al., 1988; Fig. 6H) or convoluted fabric (Rabenhorst & Wilding, 1986; Verrecchia & Verrecchia, 1994; Bindschedler et al., 2012; Fig. 6I, see also Section 3.3.2). Crusts with spongelike fabric typically also show laminated micritic hypocoatings and sparitic or needle-fibre calcite infillings. The spongelike fabric is considered to represent densely interwoven rootlet horizons, which were calcified, possibly while the rootlets were alive, by micritic and microspar calcite (Wright et al., 1988; Mack & James, 1992; Wright, 1994; Alonso-Zarza, 1999; Alonso-Zarza & Silva, 2002). In some cases, thick lamellar crusts consist of centimetre-scale alternations of micrite laminae and others, rich in detrital sediments, ooids and clays or coated micritic grains (Sanz & Wright, 1994; Fedoroff et al., 1994).

the soil matrix (Sehgal & Stoops, 1972; Courty & Fedoroff, 1985; Kemp, 1995; Zamanian et al., 2016). They may also be considered as resulting from rapid precipitation of calcium carbonate due to root metabolism (Wieder & Yaalon, 1982; Zamanian et al., 2016). The degree of impregnation of the groundmass by calcite is variable. Where impregnation is weak, the fabric of the groundmass is relatively undisturbed and the distribution of the coarse fraction unchanged. Where impregnation is moderate to strong, the fabric of the host material is variously disturbed. Becze-Deák et al. (1997) consider that the amount of hypocoatings is not correlated with the texture of the material or with the total porosity. A quasicoating may form by partial dissolution of a hypocoating.

In present-day surface soils, calcium carbonate hypocoatings have been commonly described in arid and semiarid regions (Sehgal & Stoops, 1972; Courty, 1990; Monger et al., 1991b; Zamanian et al., 2016), in areas with fluctuating water tables (Sehgal & Stoops, 1972) and in soils on loess (Mermut et al., 1983; Kemp, 1995; Becze-Deak et al., 1997; Barta, 2011, 2014). In the latter, they are often described as pseudomycelium in the field and correspond to needle-fibre calcite in thin section (see Section 3.3.2).

# 3.3 Infillings

# 3.3.1 General Aspects

Carbonate infillings are frequent in soils mainly of xeric regimes. Both dense and loose infillings are abundant, occupying all types of voids, except packing voids by definition (Stoops, 2003), and exhibiting a wide variety in size, shape and basic distribution of the component crystals. The infilling of channels and planes, as well as packing voids, by calcite enlarges the original voids sometimes considerably (Monger & Daugherty, 1991b).

# 3.3.2 Needle-Fibre Calcite

Needle-fibre calcite refers to needles and fibres of low-magnesium calcite, which are a few micrometres wide and up to several hundred micrometres long. In older micromorphological literature, especially from Eastern Europe and Russia, it has often been designated as lublinite (e.g., Ulrich, 1938; Kowalinski et al., 1972; Bal, 1975a, 1975b). The needles fill the pores in which they occur in various proportions, creating a fine interlacing partial infilling (Fig. 8A). Different types of arrangements of these fibres have been described, such as random (e.g., James, 1972; Sehgal & Stoops, 1972; Knox, 1977; Phillips & Self, 1987), convoluted (Knox, 1977; Rabenhorst & Wilding, 1986; Jones & Ng, 1988; Verrecchia & Verrecchia, 1994) and tangential surface coatings (e.g., James, 1972; Calvet & Julia, 1983).

A specific optical characteristic of these needles is that the extinction angle and elongation of the needle do not correspond to that of calcite crystals whose longitudinal axis is parallel to the  $c$ -axis, representing the preferential growth axis of calcite (straight extinction, negative elongation). A relatively constant optical extinction angle of  $40^{\circ} - 50^{\circ}$  (Iwanoff, 1906),  $32^{\circ} - 39^{\circ}$  (Stoops, 1976),  $45^{\circ}$  (Verges et al., 1982) and  $30^{\circ} - 50^{\circ}$  (Cailleau et al., 2009a, 2009b) is measured, with some exceptions (up to  $60^{\circ}$ ; Richter et al., 2008).

The use of scanning electron microscopy allowed the description of different sizes and morphological types, producing a better understanding of their nature and genesis (Fig. 8B to D). Three types of 'needles' are distinguished by their size: (i) microrods  $(<0.5\mu \mathrm{m}$  wide,  $<2\mu \mathrm{m}$  long); (ii) crystals  $(0.5 - 2\mu \mathrm{m}$  wide, up to  $100\mu \mathrm{m}$  long), representing most commonly described type, and (iii) needles  $(2 - 20\mu \mathrm{m}$  wide,  $30 - 1000\mu \mathrm{m}$  long).

A review on the morphology of needle-fibre calcite was compiled by Verrecchia and Verrecchia (1994) and updated by Cailleau et al. (2009b). In their classification, two groups are distinguished, monocrystalline rods and polycrystalline chains. The monocrystalline needles can be smooth single or paired rods (MA type) (Fig. 8E), serrated-edge paired rods (MB type) (Fig. 8F) or a transitional form from the smooth coupled rods to rods with serrated edges. The polycrystalline chains are composed of rhombohedra of calcite joined together in different ways; they correspond to the 'lenslike crystals' of Ducloux and Laouina (1989), the lublinite of Iwanoff (1906), the whisker crystals of Supko (1971), the 'calcite en échelon' of Stoops (1976) and the rhomb chains of Jones and Ng (1988). The microrods (M type) described by Verrecchia and Verrecchia (1994), which correspond to nanofibres as defined by Borsato et al. (2000) and Bindschedler et al. (2014), are not anymore considered to be a needle-fibre calcite type by Cailleau et al. (2009b).

Needle-fibre calcite occurs in a variety of vadose settings, in the voids of a large variety of soil types and palaeosols, calcretes, calcarenites, Quaternary palustrine limestones and eolianites and it is present at all latitudes, from circumpolar to tropical areas (see e.g., Jones & Kahle, 1993; Becze-Deak et al., 1997; Cailleau et al., 2009b; Barta, 2011, 2014). Needle-fibre calcite can be found in soils of different ages. In old soils, needle-fibre calcite also exists but in channels that cross-cut older carbonate horizons. Such needle-fibre crystals can be used for stable isotope analysis and radiocarbon dating if the needles can be cleanly separated from the surrounding groundmass (Monger et al., 1998; Bajnóczi & Kovács-Kis, 2006; Millière et al., 2011a, 2011b).

The origin of needle-fibre calcite has been discussed for many years and is usually interpreted in two ways: (i) a pure physicochemical origin, and (ii) a direct or indirect biological origin. The monocrystalline forms are thought to originate from directly from biological processes, whereby elongated crystals are formed by fungal biomineralisation inside mycelia bundles and subsequently released upon decay of the organic matter of the fungal walls (Callot et al., 1985a, 1985b; Verrecchia & Verrecchia, 1994; Verrecchia & Dumont, 1996; Cailleau et al., 2009a, 2009b; Bindschedler et al., 2016). The polycrystalline chains seem to be crystals formed by physicochemical process, related to rapid evaporation and/or desiccation (Cailleau et al., 2009a, 2009b). This interpretation is based on the principle that under supersaturation, the development of polycrystalline calcite needles is possible such as rhomb chains (Jones & Ng, 1988), dendritic needle-shaped crystals and whisker crystals (James, 1972; Riche et al., 1982). Moreover, microrods (Verrecchia & Verrecchia, 1994), also known as nanofibres (Bindschedler et al., 2014, 2016), which are always associated with needle-fibre calcite, result from

mineralisation of organic fibres during or after decay of fungal walls (Bindschedler et al., 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016).

Mineralogical and morphological transformations may affect needle-shaped calcite. Mineralised rods undergo diagenesis and their arrangements can evolve from a random mesh fabric to recrystallised micritic platelets, to microsparite (Fedoroff et al., 1994; Loisy et al., 1999). As mentioned above, some forms of needle-fibre calcite observed for soils can also be produced by physical weathering of shells (Villagran & Poch, 2014).

# 3.3.3 Coarse-Grained Cement

In contrast to the clay- and silt-sized crystals characteristic of pedogenic carbonate that formed in the vadose zone of soil, groundwater carbonates are characteristically sparitic (Fig. 9). The crystals engulf silicate grains, forming a coarse cement of interlocking crystals with a poikilotopic fabric. The micromorphology of the resulting deposit is characterised by phreatic cement (sparry, with palissadic or equant fabric) and the absence, in general, of obvious biogenic features. Profiles generally exhibit an increasing calcite crystal size and occurrence of euhedral crystals toward the profile base (Nash & Smith, 1998).

The relatively large size of groundwater carbonates suggests that they formed slowly from phreatic groundwater that continually supplied ions to growing crystals, in contrast with the smaller pedogenic carbonate crystals that formed rapidly from a drying vadose solution. Also, in contrast with most pedogenic carbonate horizons, the sedimentary structures such as bedding tend to be preserved when cemented by groundwater carbonate (Mack et al., 2000). It occurs in arid to semiarid climates, where evaporation and evapotranspiration rates are high. They may be associated with drainage channels (Nash & Smith, 1998), playas and lake deposits (Arakel, 1991).

# 3.4 Nodules

# 3.4.1 General Aspects

Carbonate nodules are common and occur in a wide variety of forms. Orthic nodules with gradual boundaries are generally formed in situ (Fig. 10A). In stable soils, they generally have a diffuse and irregular outline, whereas disorganic nodules indicate the effect of some pedoturbation (e.g., rotations; Wieder & Yaalon, 1974). Disorganic nodules are typical of Vertisols, shrinking and swelling of clay minerals leading to the displacement of the nodules (Driese et al., 2003; Mintz et al., 2011; Michel et al., 2013; see Kovda & Mermut, 2010, 2018). Certain nodules have a fabric that differs in composition from the soil in which they are incorporated and thus are allochthonous.

In general, micritic nodules are more common in fine- or medium-textured soils, while large sparite crystals predominate in coarse-textured soils (Wieder & Yaalon, 1974, 1982; Machette, 1985). Nodules formed by accumulations of microcrystalline calcite may exhibit a 'clotted' fabric, i.e., a flocculent structure which appears as coalescing irregular or rounded clusters (pellets) with a homogeneous micritic internal fabric (Tandon &

Friend, 1989) or a 'mottled' fabric, i.e., patches of various colours or 'globular halos' (Wright & Tucker, 1991) reflecting the complex and highly irregular variability in crystal size and the amount of clay and Fe oxides present. According to the soil moisture regime, Mn oxide inclusions may occur (e.g., Blokhuis et al., 1969; Wieder & Yaalon, 1982). In some cases, especially in recrystallised nodules, quartz grains are corroded and sometimes surrounded by dissolution pores (see Section 5.1).

Many factors influence the final morphology of the nodules (Fig. 10B). Several episodes of precipitation and dissolution may affect the nodule and lead to a complex fabric (Courty et al., 1987; Durand et al., 2007) exhibiting cavities, circumgranular and shrinkage cracks (Fig. 10C and D) and recrystallised phases. Salt concentration, hydromorphism (Sehgal & Stoops, 1972), soil texture (Wieder & Yaalon, 1982), swell-shrink behaviour

(Khadikar et al., 2000), erosion (Miller et al., 2007) and conditions favouring rapid carbonate precipitation, such as frequent desiccation or  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  loss from the soil solution (Sobecki & Wilding, 1983), are also factors that affect the typology of the nodules.

The origins of pedogenic carbonate nodules are poorly understood (Zamanian et al., 2016). In early stages of calcite deposition, diffuse impregnative nodules of microcrystalline calcite are formed, by weak impregnation of the groundmass at specific sites. When calcium carbonate accumulation increases, larger nodules can form, mainly composed of microcrystalline calcite, but with a tendency to recrystallise to a larger grain size (Sehgal & Stoops, 1972; Wieder & Yaalon 1974; Courty & Fedoroff, 1985; Achyuthan & Rajaguru, 1997).

Wright and Tucker (1991) consider that the diffusion of carbonate to certain sites is a critical factor, followed by precipitation and displacive growth, as nodules frequently contain little groundmass material. Some nodules have been described as root calcification products, which stresses the role of plant respiration in the  $\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}$ - $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ equilibrium and the preferential flow along root channels in some soils (Zamanian et al., 2016).

# 3.4.2 Pisoliths (Ooids)

Pisoliths, also referred as ooids or vadoids in the literature (Peryt, 1983; Tucker & Wright, 1991; Alonso-Zarza & Wright, 2010), are variably concentric, accretionary structures  $2\mathrm{mm}$  or larger, with or without a nucleus. They mainly consist of calcium carbonate but may also contain iron, manganese (Fig. 11), organic matter and clay minerals, such as paly-gorskite and sepiolite (Brock & Buck, 2005; Alonso-Zarza & Silva, 2002). When these layers are developed around a nucleus, they may be associated in different ways. According to Elloy and Thomas (1981), they may be concentric (the initial layers following all the unconformities of the nucleus), dissymmetric (the layers are absent or thin in one place and well developed on the opposite side) or polyphased (a series of layers resting unconformable on another set of layers; see also Nagtegaal, 1969; Siesser, 1973).

Laminations in calcareous concretions are thinner over edges and corners of angular nuclei, thus increasing the sphericity of the particle. As yet, no satisfactory explanation has been given for this phenomenon, but the effect of surface tension due to opal gels has been suggested (Hay & Wiggins, 1980). Robins et al. (2015) propose a model of ooid formation that considers plastic behaviour of clay laminae and grain movement through calcite crystallisation pressure as factors. Features composed by aggregates and grains surrounded by calcite coatings that are thick compared with the diameter of the initial grain are more often classified as nucleic nodules.

Carbonate pisoliths are common in some marine limestones affected by subaerial diagenesis (vadose pisoliths of Dunham, 1969a; James 1972) and palustrine carbonates (Freytet & Verrecchia, 2002). They are also common in highly developed petrocalcic horizons or calcretes (stage V and VI of Machette, 1985), when the carbonated horizon is well indurated and subject to pedogenesis and alteration by chemical-mechanical weathering (Arakel, 1982).

In some cases, silicate grains are at the centre of pisoliths, suggesting that they served as nuclei around which carbonate layers precipitated. Concentric bands of clay in pisoliths may result from clay neoformation as Si, Al and other elements are released from silicate grains undergoing pressure solution (Monger & Daugherty, 1991a, 1991b). In many cases, however, there are no silicate grains in the centre of pisoliths, possibly because they were completely dissolved or because tangential sections through nucleic nodules often do not show the nucleus (Stoops, 2003).

The individualisation of the nucleus may be linked to the desiccation of preexisting carbonate deposits (Freytet & Plaziat, 1982) or to root activity (Alonso-Zarza et al., 1992a). Microorganisms associated with roots may control the formation of concentric layers (Calvet & Julia, 1983; Jones, 1987). Freytet and Plaziat (1965) have described pisolith occurrences linked to the activity of cyanobacteria in Upper Cretaceous and Eocene continental formation.

# 3.5 Root-Related Features

Roots play a key role in the dynamics of calcium carbonate in the terrestrial surface environments due to chemical exchanges with the soil (Verrecchia, 2011; Zamanian et al., 2016). Petrification or impregnation of root cells by calcite is also common and many carbonate features in soils and within calcretes are attributed to the former presence of plant roots and associated microorganisms. Carbonate is commonly found precipitated around living or decayed plant roots in various forms, as described below.

# 3.5.1 Calcified Root Hairs

Calcified root hairs are tubular, non-branching extensions of epidermal cells (Fig. 12). They are about  $20~\mu \mathrm{m}$  in diameter and are typically visible with a hand lens in the field. Some calcified rootlets can have euhedral calcite crystals that are larger than  $50~\mu \mathrm{m}$ , such as those precipitated on mesquite roots in the Chihuahuan Desert (Fig. 12B). Other

shrub roots have much smaller crystal encrustations, such as those on creosote bush root hairs that sinuously surround soil particles (Fig. 12D).

These structures form by encrustation of root hair of the living plant by calcite crystals. A cast subsequently remains upon the decomposition of the organic tissue (Klappa, 1979a).

# 3.5.2 Rhizoliths

Rhizoliths are organized sedimentary structures that have been described from many parts of the world and are produced by the activity and decay of plant roots (Klappa, 1980; Cohen, 1982; Mount & Cohen, 1984; Jones & Ng, 1988; Jones & Squair, 1989). They occur as straight to sinuous cylindrical structures formed of more or less well-cemented

sediment, with lengths ranging from a few centimetres to several metres. They are also characterised by a circular cross-section, with diameters that range from  $0.1\mathrm{mm}$  to about  $20\mathrm{cm}$  (decreasing with depth), and by downward bifurcations.

The micromorphology and structure of rhizoliths depend on the position in which the calcification occurred in the rhizosphere, on the organisms involved and whether the plant was alive or dead when calcification occurred (Jaillard et al., 1991; Alonso-Zarza, 1999). The place of calcification and processes involved may correspond to (i) the cementation of soil material around the living roots, (ii) the filling of voids after the death of the roots, (iii) the calcification of root tissues, and (iv) a complex association of all these processes and the interaction of roots with other organisms, such as fungi.

Klappa (1980) identified five basic types of rhizolith: (i) root moulds, which are tubular voids that mark the positions of now-decayed roots; (ii) root casts, which are sediment-filled and/or cement-filled root moulds; (iii) root tubules, which are cemented cylinders around root moulds; (iv) rhizocretions sensu stricto, which are pedodiagenetic mineral accumulations that occur around plant roots; and (v) root petrifications, which are mineral impregnations or mineral replacements of organic matter that have partly or totally preserved the anatomical features of roots.

The rhizolith type that corresponds to the impregnation or replacement of root tissues is of particular interest, as the structure of the original cells of the root may be preserved. Several authors have described calcified root cells in sedimentary strata, palaeosols or recent soils (e.g., Klappa, 1978; Ducoux & Butel, 1983; Jaillard, 1987; Jaillard et al., 1991; Becze-Deak et al., 1997; Alonso-Zarza et al., 1998; Alonso-Zarza, 1999; Verrecchia, 2011; Zamanian et al., 2016). Under the optical or electronic microscope, it is possible to distinguish between calcified parenchymatic cells (medulla or cortex), calcification of the whole cell or of the cell walls only, epidermal cells, calcitic vessel infillings or intercellular calcifications. The calcified cortical cells vary in size from 30 to  $125\mu \mathrm{m}$ ; they are more or less equigranular and are characterised by a subangular polyhedral shape, with smooth edges, sometimes elongated radially (cytomorphic calcite; see Herrero & Porta, 1987; Jaillard, 1987; Jaillard et al., 1991; Zamanian et al., 2016). They may be arranged in concentric layers around a central channel, the stele being rarely preserved.

A specific calcification-decalcification pedofeature associated with the impregnation of root tissues is frequently observed in Mediterranean and semiarid calcareous soils. It corresponds to channel infillings of coarse cytomorphic calcite, surrounded by a zone of non-calcareous material (Fig. 13). This combination has been described in detail by Porta and Herrero (1988), Herrero (1991) and Herrero et al., (1992), who proposed the following specific terminology. The complex feature as a whole is called a 'quera'. It consists of a channel (1-2 mm wide,  $< 2$  cm long), filled with equigranular sparitic crystals (the quesparite)  $(60 - 90\mu \mathrm{m})$ , surrounded by a calcite-depleted hypocoating and quasicoating (the quedecal) in a calcareous groundmass, with associated perpendicular microchannels (the quevoids)  $35\mu \mathrm{m}$  wide and from 100 to  $600\mu \mathrm{m}$  long. Bio- or pedoturbation can destroy the queras, incorporate the cytomorphic calcite in the groundmass and significantly increase the carbonate content in the soil (the cytomorphic sands of Jaillard, 1987).

# 3.5.3 Microcodium

Microcodium is a problematic calcitic feature of some calcretes and calcareous palaeosols. It consists of a calcitic millimetric body composed of calcite prisms arranged around a central channel. Three types of Microcodium have been distinguished. The typical or classical Microcodium (type 1 and 2 of Bodergat, 1974; Microcodium a of Esteban, 1972, 1974) is composed of a single layer of radiating prismatic crystals in palisades around small nuclei or around an axis. This fabric shows a 'rosette' structure in transverse section and a 'corncob' structure in a longitudinal section. A second type is the lamellar monolaminar palissadic type, also having one layer of calcite prisms. Intermediate morphologies between this last type and the 'corncob'-type exist (Freytet & Plaziat, 1982). The third type corresponds to the Microcodium type III of Bodergat (1974) and the Microcodium b of Esteban (1972). It consists of several layers of isodiametric crystals arranged irregularly around a central void (for details about description and classification, see Klappa, 1978; Plaziat, 1984). Microcodium is differentiated from rhizoliths by its form and size. Microcodium typically has a 'rosette' structure in cross section and a 'corncob' structure in longitudinal section at the millimetre scale, which contrasts with rhizoliths that have various circular shapes in cross section and dendritic structure in longitudinal section at a millimetre to centimetre scale.

Microcodium has been described from various calcareous and hydromorphic palaeosols, especially in alluvial cones, on flood plains, in lacustrine and paludal deposits (Freytet, 1972; Bodergat, 1974; Freytet & Plaziat, 1982), from the Cretaceous to the Pliocene (Klappa, 1978; Wright & Tucker, 1991; Wright et al., 1995).

The origin of Microcodium is still subject to controversies, including the possible relationship with calcified plant roots. Studies on recent roots (Jaillard, 1987; Jaillard & Callot, 1987; Jaillard et al., 1991; Morin, 1993) have described the intracellular calcification of living root cells, which closely resemble Microcodium. Examples from the sedimentary record (e.g., Alonso-Zarza et al., 1998) indicate that the Microcodium type

composed of several layers of isodiametric calcite grains (Microcodium  $b$  of Esteban, 1972 and type III of Bodergat, 1974) seems to be formed by the calcification of root structures. The root origin of Microcodium has also been emphasised for the typical Microcodium type (Kosir, 2004). Other origins such as calcification of a mycorrhizae-cortical root cell association (Klappa, 1978) and the action of Actinomycetes (Freytet & Plaziat, 1982) have also been invoked. Kabanov et al. (2008) refer to a role of associated fungal substrate corrosion and bacterial carbonate precipitation.

# 3.6 Calcified Filaments

Calcified filaments are threadlike structures, often branching, that are encrusted with carbonate or oxalate crystals (Kahle, 1977; Klappa, 1979a; Vogt, 1984; Phillips et al., 1987; Verrecchia, 1990a, 1990b, 2011; Verrecchia et al., 1993). In thin section, they appear as thin fibres of calcite or oxalate that replicate the mycelial growth of fungal hyphae (Fig. 14A). With scanning electron microscopy, calcified filaments are revealed to be about  $4\mu \mathrm{m}$  in diameter (the typical size of fungal hyphae) with hollow centres of  $0.5 - 2\mu \mathrm{m}$  in diameter (Bruand & Duval, 1999). Their lengths are  $100\mu \mathrm{m}$  or longer with multiple branches in three dimensions. SEM also reveals that the shape of individual carbonate crystals encrusting one hypha may be different from the shape of carbonate crystals encrusting a neighbouring hypha (Fig. 14B). Crystals are mainly equant calcite rhombs ( $1 - 2\mu \mathrm{m}$  in diameter), micron-sized plate-shaped crystals or needles ( $1 - 2\mu \mathrm{m}$  long,  $0.1\mu \mathrm{m}$  wide), which may be perpendicular to the substrate (Klappa, 1979a; Phillips et al., 1987; Verrecchia et al., 1993; Bindschedler et al., 2016).

Calcified filaments may be associated with non-calcified filaments, characterised by a smooth, warty or hairy surface (Klappa, 1979a) or with partially calcified filaments. This

range reflects the various stages between primary filaments and the calcite- and/or oxalate-encrusted structures.

The filaments frequently occur on the walls of channels and voids where they may form dense mats, but they may also occur within the matrix where they are intimately associated with micrite. They have been recorded from Quaternary calcretes worldwide in different environments (e.g., Kahle, 1977; Klappa, 1979a; Scoppa & Pasos, 1981; Phillips et al., 1987; Jones & Ng, 1988; Verrecchia, 1990a; Monger et al., 1991b; Verrecchia et al., 1993; Monger & Adams, 1996; Loisy & Pascal, 1998; Bruand & Duval, 1999; Jiménez-Espinoza & Jiménez-Millán, 2003; Blanco & Stoops, 2007).

The origin of calcified filaments is biogenic, based on their size, shape and arrangement (Klappa, 1979a), as well as on laboratory and field experiments (Monger et al., 1991a; Bindschedler et al., 2014, 2016; Khormali et al., 2014). The alkaline mucilaginous sheath surrounding the hyphae provides an aqueous environment where  $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$  combines with bicarbonate generated by respiration. With time, carbonate crystals are precipitated in the mucilaginous sheath and form a crust around the hyphae. When the fungus dies, a carbonate tube remains after the organic tissue decomposes (Klappa, 1979a; Phillips et al., 1987). Verrecchia (1990b) and Verrecchia et al. (1993) propose a chronological sequence of fungal filament mineralisation involving the precipitation and transformation of calcium oxalates. Fungi may play a key role in transformation of limestone or calcareous soil material by a redistribution of calcium carbonate (Verrecchia, 1990a; Bindschedler et al., 2016). Due to the activity of microorganisms (fungi and bacteria), a combination of solution and precipitation can gradually convert soft powdery limestone into a harder crust (Verrecchia & Dumont, 1996).

# 3.7 Biogenic Crystal Intergrowths

# 3.7.1 Earthworm Granules

Many species of earthworm produce calcium carbonate in the form of  $0.1 - 2.5\mathrm{mm}$  large granules (Darwin, 1881). These granules are aggregates of individual calcite crystals arranged in a radial, parallel or random pattern depending partly on species (Fig. 15; Canti & PEARCE, 2003).

A typical example consists of a roughly  $0.5 - 2.5\mathrm{mm}$  spheroidal to ellipsoidal aggregate made up of  $0.05 - 0.2\mathrm{mm}$  calcite crystals arranged approximately radially (Fig. 15A and B; see also Leiber & Maus, 1969; Weicek & Messenger, 1972; Preece et al., 1995; Becze-Deak et al., 1997). Amongst northern European earthworms, granules of this general morphology are produced by the surface feeding species such as Lumbricus terrestris, Lumbricus rubellus and Lumbricus castaneus. Soil-ingesting species (e.g., Aporrectodea caliginosa and Aporrectodea icterica) living predominantly in the A and upper B horizons, produce much smaller granules, often with irregular shapes (Canti & Piearce, 2003). In some species, the cementation of the granules is so weak that they easily fragment into individual crystals after entering the soil, and all species produce some single rhombohedral calcite crystals alongside their normal granule output.

# 3.7.2 Fecal Spherulites

Calcium carbonate spherulites (Fig. 16) typically sized between 5 and  $15\mu \mathrm{m}$  are produced in large numbers as a result of animal digestive processes (Brochier, 1983; Brochier et al., 1992; Canti, 1997, 1998a, 1999). The spherulites are made up of nanosized crystals (Fig. 16D) organised radially (Fig. 16B), producing an extinction cross (Fig. 16A) with negative elongation of the acicular crystals (Fig. 16C).

Although fecal spherulites are produced in the gut of many different animals, they are more abundant in herbivores such as cow, sheep, goat (Canti, 1999), llama and alpaca (Coil et al., 2003). The reasons for spherulite production are not known and many modern dung samples do not contain any. Among samples that do contain spherulites, there is a strong tendency for higher numbers to be produced by animals grazing plants from soils with pH higher than 6 (Canti, 1999). Preservation is partly dependent on pH, and soil or sediment matrix values above pH 7.5 offer the best conditions. Spherulites are valuable indicators of dung in studies of archaeological soils and sediments (Brochier, 1990, 1996; Coil et al., 2003).

# 3.7.3 Remains of Mollusca

Operculi are mineralised seals produced by snails to block their shell openings for seasonal resting stages. They are roughly elliptical, but with one slightly recurved and pointed end. The structure is built up of concentric layers varying in thickness and starting from a central boss. Crystallisation consists of rather irregular growths on the inside of the operculum, but vertically arranged individual crystals of around  $1 - 4\mu \mathrm{m}$  develop toward the outside (Bandel, 1990). A thin section shows mostly unstructured calcium carbonate, but some cuts near the edge yield subparallel layout of 50- to 150-  $\mu \mathrm{m}$ -thick crystals rather like an eggshell (Fig. 17).

Arionid granules are single or multiple calcium carbonate crystals (Fig. 18) produced in the shield (beneath the skin) of slugs of the genus Arion and released only on death (Canti, 1998b). The single crystals are small, mostly elongated prismatic shapes with slightly rounded faces (Fig. 18D). In some cases, the crystals are twinned, cruciform or joined in threefold symmetry (Fig. 18D). Many have one or two outgrowths from the main prism which appear to develop into numerous lobate shapes (Fig. 18B). In crossed polarised light (Fig. 18A and C), Arion granules present very disparate morphologies. Constituent crystals range from 25 to  $500\mu \mathrm{m}$  and appear to have no pattern of growth. Clusters of the smallest crystals are found next to the largest; small crystals appear to have been enveloped by larger ones; boundaries between crystals are sharp and frequently jagged due to intergrowth. Generally, granules smaller than  $250\mu \mathrm{m}$  tend to be single crystals and the lobes on polycrystalline granules are clearly individual crystals as well (Canti, 1998b).

# 4. Recrystallisation and Dissolution

# 4.1 Recrystallisation

Soil carbonates, once precipitated, are very frequently subjected to recrystallisation, which increases in development with the age of the soil (Zamanian et al., 2016). It can be deduced from a range of microscopic characteristics (Fig. 19). For a complete review of recrystallisation features in sedimentary petrology, the reader is referred to other sources (e.g., Folk, 1962; Barthurst, 1975).

The distinctive features of carbonate recrystallisation in soils include the following:

- irregular distribution of crystal size, with gradual transition between zones of sparite crystals with distinct sizes that lack detectable boundaries and between micritic and sparry calcite domains (Ringrose et al., 2002). The crystals occur clustered in domains, which vary in a very irregular way over short distances with clusters of microsparite, pseudosparite and sparite;

- microfabrics exhibiting 'mottled' or irregular crystal mosaics, where crystal sizes range from micrite to spar in patches with diffuse margins are thought by many authors to be the result of the replacement of finer crystals by coarse ones (Tandon & Narayan, 1981; Wieder & Yaalon, 1982; Tandon & Friend, 1989);  
- starlike masses with a central zone of microsparite or pseudosparite, surrounded by sparite crystals. The sparite crystals are frequently elongated and radially arranged;  
- sparitic crystals with a radial fibrous fabric, frequently with undulating extinction, forming coatings. Cytomorphic calcite may exhibit a fabric close to recrystallisation features, but the latter is characterised by irregular or curved intercrystalline

boundaries and very irregular crystal-size distribution (Tucker, 1991), whereas calcified root cells are characterised by the isodiametric morphology of crystals and specific arrangements (Jaillard et al., 1991; see Section 3.5);

- curved contacts between neighbouring sparitic carbonate crystals.

# 4.2 Dissolution

Because of their relatively high solubility, at least in comparison with silicate minerals, carbonates may dissolve from horizons in which they originally accumulated, as a reaction to changes in climate or local conditions toward a higher humidity or acidity. Some of the most common indications of dissolution and remobilisation of previously accumulated carbonates are reported below.

In some cases, the grains display well-rounded shapes, usually ellipsoidal, although spherical ones are not unknown, and show some large intergranular spaces. The most distinctive feature of this process is the presence of crystals with pronounced serration as a result of dissolution (e.g., James & Choquette, 1984).

The presence of mouldic voids (e.g., dissolved shells) is very diagnostic for dissolution processes. They are linked to dissolution in deep horizons where the lack of pedoturbation allows the preservation of crystal morphologies.

Another dissolution feature is the presence of clay-coating networks, without carbonate crystals (Alonso et al., 2004). They seem to have formed first by partial dissolution of carbonate grains forming an intergranular pore, followed by clay illuviation filling the pore, further dissolution of the carbonate grain and thus formation of the clay-coating networks.

Depletion hypocoatings can form by removal of part of the micromass in solution. Calcite depleted hypocoatings are frequently observed around roots in calcareous Mediterranean soils (Herrero & Porta, 1987) and in gypsic horizons (Barzanji & Stoops, 1974).

# 5. Associated features

# 5.1 Dissolution of Silicate Minerals

The replacement of silicate material by carbonate has been discussed by numerous authors (Reeves, 1970; Millot et al., 1977; Ruellan et al., 1979; Watts, 1980) and is referred to as epigenesis by, e.g., Nahon and Ruellan (1975) and Ruellan et al. (1979). This process is common in horizons with high calcite content.

Dissolution of silicates can be related to the well-expressed alkaline pH of these horizons, which causes a destabilisation of the quartz and other minerals, especially feldspars and micas. They are replaced by calcite due to the opposite trend in solubility of silica and carbonate as a function of pH. Very high pH is not required for the whole horizon, but it is sufficient that it is reached periodically and very locally. In a calcic horizon, the pH can be locally quite high and spatially variable (Callot et al., 1978). It requires a high concentration of carbonate and is favoured by the presence of coarse-

grained carbonates that absorb less  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  on their surface. An intermediate phase would be the transformation of the primary silicates to palygorskite (Verrecchia & Le Coustumer, 1996), which in turn is transformed to calcite. Wang et al. (1994) suggested a dynamic model for calccrete genesis involving the pseudomorphic replacement of silicate parent material. A critical requirement is the presence of some amount of magnesium in the medium for the formation of transitory fibrous clay minerals and thus creation of unsaturated conditions with respect to  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ . The replacements are especially visible when illuvial clay coatings (exhibiting a strong orientation) are substituted (Alonso et al., 2004).

Floating grains (quartz, feldspars) are isolated grains embedded in a micritic matrix, surrounded by spar rims or by pore space. According to several authors (Nagtegaal, 1969; Reeves, 1976; Millot et al., 1977; Reheis, 1988; Paquet & Ruellan, 1993), the presence of feldspar and quartz grains floating in a carbonate matrix (Fig. 20D) is linked to the

replacement of silicate minerals, the more or less large porous spaces between the grains and the matrix being attributed to the (congruent) dissolution of quartz and feldspar at very high pH values, in arid areas (see Section 4.1). However, some authors consider that the surrounding spar rims around the grains may have formed by the filling of a crack around the grain (circumgranular cracking) caused by dissolution or shrinkage of the micrite (Tandon & Friend, 1989).

Dissolution of silicates may also be related to a pressure effect. Displacement can occur by crystallisation pressure (Maliva & Siever, 1988), pushing preexisting grains and displacing them, when solutions carrying dissolved  $\mathrm{CaCO_3}$  penetrate along grain fractures or other planes of weakness. Displaced grain fragments often appear to retain grain outlines (Watts, 1978). Some indications of the process of displacement are (i) the presence of fragmented and separate mineral grains, showing important changes in position of the different fragments; (ii) the presence of expanded micaceous grains with separated and twisted flakes (this process has been called 'plasmasprengung' by Kerpen et al., 1960); and (iii) areas of original material compressed in zones of high density. When the K-fabric reaches an advanced stage and pedogenic carbonate crystals are densely crowded together, as in highly indurated petrocalic horizons, silicate grains often become displaced and fragmented (Fig. 20A to C). This is accompanied by the formation of serrated edges on silicate grains (Fig. 20C). Because the shapes of the serrated edges match the shapes of impacting calcite crystals, a hypothesis has arisen that dissolution of silicate grains may result from pressure exerted by calcite precipitation: the force-of-crystallisation hypothesis (Maliva & Siever, 1988; Reheis, 1988). The ability of a growing crystal to exert a linear force on its surroundings is well documented in both laboratory and field studies (Wieder & Yaalon, 1974; Buczynski & Chafetz, 1987). Force of crystallisation can be strong enough to cause quartz grain breakages and separation by the growth of carbonate cement. It has been further hypothesised that as a consequence of force-of-crystallisation, the released silicon and aluminium reprecipitates as palygorskite and sepiolite clays (see Mees, 2010, 2018).

# 5.2 Calcium Oxalate Occurrences

The calcium oxalates whewellite  $\mathrm{(CaC_2O_4\cdot H_2O)}$  and weddellite  $\mathrm{(CaC_2O_4\cdot 2H_2O)}$  are organic minerals, occurring in various geological environments (e.g., Del Monte et al., 1987; Watchman, 1990; Verrecchia et al., 1993; Russ et al., 1996).

Whewellite crystals have an isodiametric or elongated morphology. The isodiametric crystals have the form of small oblong parallelepipeds, prisms and pseudorhombohedra (Frey-Wyssling, 1981) or tablets (Wadsten & Moberg, 1985; Jones & Wilson 1986). Weddellite crystals can be dipyramidal, elongated prismatic with pyramidal terminations or superimposed tablets (Verrecchia et al., 1993). Elongation of these crystals leads to needle shapes. The optical properties of the calcium oxalates are very similar to those of calcite.

# 5.2.1 Lichens and Fungi

Lichens are well known to produce calcium oxalates (Syers et al., 1967; Wadsten & Moberg, 1985) that can form crusts on rock surfaces (Del Monte et al., 1987; Russ et al., 1994; 1996). Russ et al. (1996) showed that lichens produced a calcium oxalate residue during dry periods on exposed limestone surfaces in open-air shelters (Lower Pecos region, southwest Texas) and that the oxalate may serve as an indicator of past xeric climate changes. In desert environments, fungi (Staley et al., 1982; Verrecchia, 2000) can also produce calcium oxalate when associated with various soils (Verrecchia, 1990a; Verrecchia et al., 1990b). In both cases, the oxalic acid can react with the available calcium in the environment or in tissues to form calcium oxalate salts (weddellite or whewellite). The importance of the precipitation of calcium oxalates by fungal filaments (Simkiss & Wilbur, 1989) in the redistribution of calcium in calcretes and limestone hardening by secondary calcite precipitation has been highlighted by Verrecchia (1990b) and Verrecchia and Dumont (1996). Those studies suggest that weddellite  $\mathrm{(CaC_2O_4\cdot 2H_2O}$  or  $\mathrm{CaC_2O_4\cdot 3H_2O)}$  forms at the first stage of fungal filament mineralisation, followed by their evolution into more stable monohydrate crystals (whewellite,  $\mathrm{CaC_2O_4\cdot H_2O})$  and then the transformation of calcium oxalate to calcium carbonate by bacteria, resulting in the formation of calcified filaments.

Recent experimental work on the oxalate-carbonate biogeochemical pathway has emphasised the important role of soil bacteria in the consumption of oxalate, resulting in carbonate precipitation (Verrecchia et al., 2006; Cailleau et al., 2011). Cailleau et al. (2005) showed that calcium carbonate accumulation can occur in orthox acidic equatorial soils during a dry period due to the presence of a large amount of oxalate in soil and of oxalotropic bacteria for oxalate oxidation into carbonate.

# 5.2.2 Calcium Oxalate Phytoliths

Most trees and herbaceous plants contain large amounts of  $10 - 50\mu \mathrm{m}$  large calcium oxalate crystals either as whewellite or weddellite. These take the form of individual single or twinned prismatic crystals, druses (approximately radial aggregates) and raphides (needle-shaped crystals) according to species and location within the plant (Pobeguin, 1943; Arnott & Pautard, 1970; Franceschi & Horner, 1980; Horner & Wagner, 1995; Franceschi & Nakata, 2005).

Calcium oxalate can dominate the dry weight of some plants. Among herbaceous and tree species, quantities are usually smaller but still significant. Leaves of most common deciduous trees, for example, contain large amounts of prismatic oxalate crystals armouring the veins (Fig. 21), as well as druse crystals (Fig. 22) in the parenchyma.

Calcium oxalate crystals are found in the soil within plant litter and live plant tissue, but they are rapidly broken down by soil processes (Brochier, 1996). Pseudomorphs of calcium oxalate phytoliths formed of calcium carbonate are commonly found in anthropogenic soils as a result of burning plants (ash). When plants are burned, calcium oxalate loses its hydrocarbon portion and forms CaO, which recarbonates from

atmospheric  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  to form  $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ . Despite the chemical change involved, this process does not cause the original calcium oxalate shapes to fragment, and perfect druse or prismatic crystal shapes (Fig. 23) are thus retained in the soil as pseudomorphs (Brochier, 1983, 2002; Canti, 2003; Cailleau et al., 2005).

# 6. Formations with Combinations of Calcareous Features

# 6.1 Palustrine Carbonates

Palustrine limestones result from episodic subaerial exposure and associated pedogenesis of lacustrine mud during the lake-level low-stands. Thus, palustrine carbonates are characterised by a range of sedimentary features of the primary lacustrine deposit and pedogenic features due to later transformations (Freytet, 1984). Reviews of these

palustrine facies and microfabrics can be found in Freytet (1973), Freytet and Plaziat (1982), Freytet and Verrecchia (2002), Alonso-Zarza (2003) and Verrecchia (2007). Lacustrine limestones may be varved, laminated or homogeneous, with remains of charophytes, gastropods and ostracods and algae, sometimes bioturbated (burrows). Brecciated layers formed by mechanical reworking may be intercalated, as detrital beds (Freytet, 1984; Freytet & Verrecchia, 2002).

Pedogenic modifications are due to desiccation processes, root and soil organism activity, redistribution of carbonate and iron within the soil and sediments and physical and chemical phenomena such as dissolution and cementation and alternately phreatic and vadose environments. Typical palustrine features include mottling, channels, zones with a granular microstructure, desiccation cracks, and horizontal, planar and circumgranular cracks, brecciation and nodule development, rhizoliths, coated grains, dissolution cavities with complex vadose carbonate coatings and internal sediment infillings,

laminar structure, Microcodium and early and late diagenetic crystals or crystal intergrowths (Freytet, 1973, 1984; Freytet & Plaziat, 1982; Alonso-Zarza et al., 1992b; Platt & Wright, 1992; Wright & Platt, 1995; Verrecchia, 2007).

# 6.2 Calcrete Profiles

The formation of thick calccrete profiles is the result of prolonged carbonate accumulation that goes through different stages of development. The concept of morphogenetic carbonate stages, whereby progressively older geomorphic surfaces have associated soils with progressively more developed carbonate stages, was introduced by Gile et al. (1966). Features of these soils include Stage I filaments and pebble coatings, Stage II nodules and interpebble fillings, Stage III calcic horizons with carbonate-plugged zones and Stage IV laminar layers overlying plugged horizons. Stage V calcretes, with cemented pisoliths and laminae, and Stage VI calcretes, with multiple generations of recemented breccia, pisoliths and laminae, were later introduced by Machette (1985). Recently, the features described by Gile et al. (1966) have been revised by Zamanian et al. (2016), who invoked a more important role of the groundwater during late stages of calcrete development. Itkin et al. (2016) consider the potential role of human activities in the formation of calcretes associated with anthropogenic soils and sediments.

The morphological classification system of Netterberg (1980) and Goudie (1983), modified by Wright and Tucker (1991), is also widely used. However, the formation of a calccrete profile is often more complex than a single sequence of stages for calccrete profile development. In some situations, one single stage may include several phases of erosion, soil formation and sedimentary processes. These interacting processes may be highlighted by the thin section analysis and the observation of elementary microfacies (Verrecchia, 1987, 2002; Verrecchia & Freytet, 1987). Indeed, calccrete profiles often include many of the carbonate features described in this chapter, with various degrees of development and in various combinations (Zhou & Chafetz, 2009; Pfeiffer et al., 2012; Kaplan et al., 2013; Khalaf & Al-Zamel, 2016).

Such massive terrestrial carbonates often contain as much carbon as Histosols, but as inorganic carbon rather than organic carbon (see Zamanian et al., 2016). Whether these massive carbonate horizons sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide depends on the source of calcium (Verrecchia et al., 2006; Cailleau et al., 2011), whose identification can be supported by thin section and SEM studies, for instance focusing on Ca-silicate weathering. If calcium is derived directly from silicates, carbonates sequester  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ , in contrast to calcium derived from preexisting carbonates (Monger et al., 2015).

# 7. Conclusions

The precipitation and the accumulation of calcium carbonate in soils and regoliths are very complex phenomena. As they are linked to the interaction among the lithosphere, the biosphere and the atmosphere, pedogenic carbonate may be important proxies of palaeoenvironmental changes.

Even if controversies still exist on the genesis of carbonate features, the study of the morphological expression and hierarchical organisation of calcitic pedofeatures in thin sections allows climatic, geochemical and biological influences on the precipitation of carbonate in soils to be partially deciphered. With the contribution of submicroscopic techniques, progress has been made in the understanding of the relationships between the biological activity and the precipitation of carbonate, and many calcitic features seem to be linked to biological processes, in a direct or indirect manner.

For complex calcic and petrocalic horizons, micromorphology also highlights the processes, which affect the primary accumulation of carbonate through time (Brasier, 2011). Carbonates may represent a highly active phase, undergoing intense transformation such as recrystallisation, dissolution and secondary precipitation. For these types of ancient carbonate horizons, future studies have to be performed to distinguish the active traits from inherited ones.

# 1. Introduction

Gypsic features in soils and sediments are composed of gypsum  $(\mathrm{Ca(SO_4)}\cdot 2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O})$ , a mineral with rather low solubility  $(2.6\mathrm{g / L})$ , or they are at least related to gypsum formation. Gypsum is formed when  $\mathrm{Ca^{2 + }}$  and  $\mathrm{SO}_4^{2 - }$  concentrations in the soil are high. These ions can come from the dissolution of calcium sulphates contained in rocks in the

catchment, but they can also be separately derived from the alteration of limestone, carbonates of biological origin, sulphide-bearing formations. After the development of gypsum crystals in soils and sediments, they can be transported by wind, producing eolian gypsiferous or gypseous parent materials.

Bulk determination of total gypsum content, necessary for soil behaviour forecasting, may be insufficient for genetic interpretations (Artieda et al., 2006), for instance, in areas with gypsiferous parent materials where a distinction between pedogenic and lithogenic gypsum is important (Carter & Inskeep, 1988; Stoops & Poch, 1994). Micromorphological studies can help in understanding the distribution and genesis of gypsic features, including those that are not recognised in the field.

For information on the worldwide distribution of gypsiferous soils, and on their characteristics, the reader is referred to general reviews (e.g., Watson, 1983; FAO, 1990; Herrero & Boixadera, 2002; Herrero et al., 2009). Gypsum, both inherited and pedogenic, is most abundant in soils under arid or semiarid climates, because evaporative concentration is generally required for its formation and because it is easily leached in humid climates. Under extreme hot, dry conditions gypsum can transform to bassanite  $(\mathrm{Ca(SO_4)}\cdot 0.5\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O})$  or anhydrite  $(\mathrm{Ca(SO_4)})$  (see Mees & Tursina, 2010, 2018). Gypsum also occurs in acid sulphate soils, whose micromorphological characteristics are discussed elsewhere (Mees & Stoops, 2010, 2018).

A summary of their characteristics is given in Table 1. Other habits have also been reported, such as prismatic pseudohexagonal, with  $\{010\}$ ,  $\{111\}$ ,  $\{\overline{1}11\}$  and  $\{120\}$

# 2. Crystal Morphology

# 2.1 Occurrences in Nature

In thin sections, gypsum is easily recognised by its first-order grey interference colours, well-expressed cleavage parallel to (010), low negative relief ( $n$  1.520-1.529) and biaxial positive sign. Cleavage and optical sign are helpful to distinguish gypsum from quartz.

The crystal morphology of gypsum is highly variable and has been described using various terms. Descriptions are based on observations at different scales, using different techniques, and they partly involve interpretation of 3D shapes based on 2D cross sections. Common habits of gypsum in soils and sediments of arid and semiarid regions are prismatic, tabular, hemi-bipyramidal, lenticular and acicular. A summary of their characteristics is given in Table 1. Other habits have also been reported, such as prismatic pseudohexagonal, with  $\{010\}$ ,  $\{111\}$ ,  $\{\overline{1}11\}$  and  $\{120\}$  forms (Jafarzadeh & Burnham, 1992). The pseudohexagonal aspect of non-prismatic gypsum crystals in cross sections parallel to the plane of flattening is commonly indicated in the descriptive terms that are used (e.g., Buck & Van Hoesen, 2002).

Lenticular gypsum represents the most common morphology of gypsum in soils and has been described by many authors (e.g., Barzanji & Stoops, 1974; Watson, 1979; Stoops & Ilaiwi, 1981; Allen, 1985; Herrero & Porta, 1987; Pankova & Yamnova, 1987; Arricibita et al., 1988; Benayas et al., 1988; Carter & Inskeep, 1988; Halitim, 1988; Porta & Herrero, 1988; Eswaran & Zi-Tong, 1991; Herrero, 1991; Jafarzadeh & Burnham, 1992; Poch, 1992; Amit & Yaalon, 1996; Artieda, 1996, 2004; Chen, 1997; Poch et al., 1998; Buck & Van Hoesen, 2002; Buck et al., 2006). Some authors suggest that a lenticular morphology derives from a prismatic crystal habit, whereby the preferential development of the  $\{\overline{1}03\}$  face results in a lenticular shape (Mandado & Tena, 1989; Cody, 1991). Other authors consider gypsum lenses as hemi-bipyramidal or pseudohexagonal crystals with curved faces and rounded edges (Siesser & Rogers, 1976; Logan, 1987). Lenticular gypsum occurs as single crystals or as crystal intergrowths, as in the case of desert roses. They may also occur as massive crystallisations.

Acicular crystals are relatively rare. Some authors consider that the confining space is one of the controlling factors for the development of this crystal habit, indicating that when the crystal grows under confining pressure, as it does in the soil matrix, this would favour acicular or tabular habits (e.g., Eswaran & Zi-Tong, 1991). Watson (1985, 1989) mentions the presence of acicular gypsum in subsurface crusts, indicating an origin by displacive crystallisation. Likewise, Verboom et al. (2003) attribute the formation of fibrous gypsum pendants to downward displacive crystallisation, controlled by preferential flows through highly porous media or by hydration/dehydration processes. On the contrary, Jafarzadeh and Burnham (1992) consider that for acicular gypsum, the space to extend in length may be the key factor, rather than any type of confinement.

Fibrous gypsum occurs mainly in geological formations, as part of extensional veins (e.g., Testa & Lugli, 2000). Fibrous gypsum in soils is generally interpreted as inherited

from parent material (Nettleton et al., 1982; Porta, 1998; Cantón et al., 2001). Nevertheless, fibrous gypsum has been described as pedogenic precipitates in some studies (Worrall, 1957; Labib, 1970; El-Sayed, 1993), and a fibrous texture is also recognised for pendants (Verboom et al., 2003; Lebedeva & Konyshkova, 2011; Lebedeva et al., 2014).

# 2.2 Experimental Studies

Numerous studies on gypsum crystal formation have been published. Only those that are directly relevant for soil environments are discussed here.

Cody and Shanks (1974) studied the influence of  $\mathsf{pH}$ , temperature and growing media on gypsum crystallisation. They obtained elongated prismatic crystals growing in silica gel and tabular crystals in bentonite gel. Cody (1979) showed that lenticular gypsum is formed in the presence of organic matter (mangrove leaves), at high  $\mathsf{pH}$  and in conditions favouring slow growth. Organic matter in solution promoted a lower yield, a longer induction period and fewer crystals. This is in agreement with Porta (1986), who found that gypsum crystals growing in free solutions, both with and without sand, had prismatic and tabular habits, while those growing in the presence of cereal straw were lenticular. Cody and Cody (1988) explained the relationship between the lenticular crystal morphology and the presence of organic material by the inhibition of growth due to high-molecular weight organic complexes under alkaline  $\mathsf{pH}$ , which are fixed along {010} planes that include water molecules. In contrast, Jafarzadeh and Burnham (1992) produced lenticular crystals in sands without organic matter at  $\mathsf{pH}$  3.6. They observed that the first crystals to form in soils are small euhedral tabular or anhedral crystals, which subsequently develop a lenticular morphology in a wide range of conditions. In addition to lenticular crystal development, Cody and Cody (1988) also report the development of twinning in the presence of organic compounds. Harouaka et al. (2014) obtained small, twinned, flat tabular crystals at fast precipitation rates and both flat tabular crystals and longer needles at slower rates.

Kushnir (1980) considers the  $\mathrm{CaSO_4}$  ratio as the key factor for crystal morphology, whereby high ratios promote the development of lenticular crystals and low values favour prismatic forms. This has been related to bonds of  $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$  ions, lodged in  $\{\overline{1}11\}$  planes, with organic compounds, inhibiting the growth in this direction (Aref, 1998). High temperatures  $(60^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$  have also been found to promote lenticular habits, whereas lower temperatures  $(30^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$  promote prismatic habits, in the absence of organic matter (Cody, 1979; Cody & Cody, 1988).

A prismatic habit is promoted by rapid growth, because in those conditions the organic molecules do not have enough time to interact with the faces of the growing crystal (Cody, 1979). The growth of long prismatic crystals is also promoted by low pH, due to the adsorption of  $\mathrm{H^{+}}$  ions on  $\{010\}$  and  $\{110\}$  faces. It favours the growth perpendicular to  $\{111\}$  and  $\{\overline{1}03\}$  faces, parallel to the  $c$ -axis (Cody, 1979). The occurrence of elongated prismatic crystals in a context of pyrite oxidation (see Mees & Stoops, 2010, 2018)

is probably due to pH effects (Cody, 1979). Similarly, Barta et al. (1971) obtained acicular crystals in gels at  $\mathrm{pH} < 7$  and more tabular crystals at  $\mathrm{pH} > 8$ .

Salts (NaCl) in solution promote the growth of larger and fewer crystals, due to the higher solubility of gypsum (Zen, 1965) which leads to less nucleation. Monovalent ions favour the growth of larger and better prismatic crystals (Cody, 1979; Cody & Cody, 1988).

# 3. Groundmass

Gypsum that is part of the parent material should clearly be described as a groundmass component. This is, for instance, the case for remnants of gypsum rock, eolian gypsum sands and gypsiferous salt lake deposits. Other gypsum occurrences in soils are generally pedofeatures, formed by pedogenic processes. Nevertheless, from the descriptive point of view there are some situations in which all gypsum in a thin section could be considered as groundmass, especially when it forms the base material of the soil. One reason can be the difficulty to distinguish between inherited and pedogenic gypsum using standard microscopic techniques, especially for gypsum with a very small crystal size (Herrero & Porta, 2000; see also Carter & Inskeep, 1988) for non-microcrystalline gypsum). Bullock et al. (1985) recommend considering pedogenic micritic calcite within the groundmass as part of the micromass, which could also be applied for microcrystalline gypsum. A second reason can be the large total volume of pedogenic gypsum in many soils, whereby a description as groundmass material is in line with the procedure suggested for continuous pedogenic features such as laterite crusts (Bullock et al., 1985). A third reason is that, regardless of its origin, gypsum in gypsous materials is the base material of the soil, which determines its physical and chemical properties and its macro- and mesomorphological appearance. In view of these considerations, gypsum in gypsous horizons is considered as groundmass material in this chapter. However, a different approach is recommended in studies related to soil genesis, because the concept of pedofeatures has a connotation of pedogenic origin and because the pedofeature category of crystals and crystal intergrowths should apply without considering abundance (Mees, pers. comm.).

Gypsum can appear in soil materials of very different properties and origins, and therefore there is not a specific set of characteristics of the non-gypsic groundmass. In calcareous soils, the b-fabric is normally crystallitic micritic, but in non-calcareous materials it can also be stipple-speckled (Moghiseh & Heidari, 2012) or striated (Laya et al., 1993; Scalenghe et al., 2016). Granostriated b-fabrics related to gypsum crystals are sometimes observed, indicating pressures due to displacive crystal growth within the matrix. It is best shown in clayey, non-calcareous matrices, being masked in other cases. In clay-rich soils showing vertic features, gypsum crystals can be oriented parallel to porostriation along planar voids (Scalenghe et al., 2016). Another possible general feature is layering, in soils developed on parent materials with synsedimentary gypsum beds (e.g., Poch, 1992; Mees et al., 2012). Displacive growth of lenticular gypsum can disturb

the original orientation of sedimentary groundmass components (Basyoni & Aref, 2015), and it can shatter rock fragments in reg soils (Amit et al., 1993).

Gypseous horizons are considered to be the end points of the gypsumification process, which implies progressive precipitation of gypsum in the horizon from a soil solution saturated with respect to gypsum. Herrero et al. (1992) describe gypsum enrichment of a soil as displacive crystallisation, in combination with biological activity, giving rise to an 'isles fabric', which is characterised by non-gypsic 'isles' surrounded by lenticular gypsum occurrences (see Fig. 1A), which can appear as dense infillings (Lebedeva & Konyshkova, 2010, 2011). This fabric can also occur in horizons with xenotopic gypsum (Stoops, pers. comm.) and microcrystalline gypsum (Aznar et al., 2013). Barzanji and Stoops (1974) propose progressive enrichment of the groundmass by gypsum crystals consisting of the precipitation of gypsum in channels. It forms pore infillings that are later disrupted and incorporated into the groundmass by biological activity, which in turn creates new pore space for gypsum to precipitate as new pore infillings. The end point is a groundmass formed almost exclusively of gypsum crystals with a distinct vermicular microstructure. Reheis (1987) and Buck and Van Hoesen (2002) propose a mechanism of gypsumification in four stages, similar to the one of Gile et al. (1966) for calcareous soils. Toomanian et al. (2001) also find four stages of gypsumification, from loose crystal intercalations, infillings and nodules, gypsum pendants under gravels to fine-grained hypergypsic horizons or coarse-crystalline petrogypsic horizons, which are both firm continuous layers. The micromorphological classification of hypersiferous materials by Stoops and Poch (1994), based on morphological observations, indicates stages of gypsumification as well, from few infillings and coatings in pores, to massive accumulations, with fabrics from lenticular to microcrystalline or coarse-crystalline xenotopic. Despite these observations, some hypergypsic horizons are not necessarily

the result of a progressive enrichment with gypsum, for instance, when soil forms on gypsum rock or on gypsum-rich eolian or lacustrine deposits.

The groundmass of massive accumulations of gypsum has several typologies depending on the degree of cementation and crystal size. Four main types are distinguished: powdery gypsic materials, microcrystalline gypsum, rupture-resistant gypsic materials and eolian gypsic materials.

# 3.1 Powdery Gypsic Materials

Powdery gypsic materials (commonly  $>60\%$  gypsum) are generally apedal, with a roughly coarse monic c/f-related distribution pattern, although sometimes a very coarse prismatic structure due to vertical fissures is recognised in the field. Gypsic powdery materials are classified as 'hypergypsic lenticular' or 'hologypsic lenticular' subformations according to the proposal of Stoops and Poch (1994). The coarse material in the groundmass is composed mainly of sand-sized lenticular gypsum crystals. It may also consist of quartz grains and coarse gypsum crystals with various habits (Aref, 2003). The fine material mainly appears as part of the non-gypsic fraction, which occurs as 'isles' separated by the gypsum ('isles fabric'; Herrero et al., 1992) (Fig. 1A). Gypsum infillings and coatings are irregularly distributed and strongly reworked by faunal activity, which reorganises gypsum crystals in passage features with crescent patterns, according to the gypsification process proposed by Barzanji and Stoops (1974). Powdery gypsum is well documented for the so-called gazha soils in Russia and Uzbekistan (Pankova & Yamnova, 1987; Verba, 1990; Verba & Yamnova, 1997) (Fig. 1B), attributed to groundwater precipitation (Yamnova & Pankova, 2013) but also to physical weathering of gypsum rocks (Goryachkin et al., 2003).

# 3.2 Microcrystalline Gypsic Materials

Massive accumulations of microcrystalline gypsum are described in the field as having a flourlike consistency (Neher & Bailey, 1976; Heinze & Fiedler, 1984; Herrero, 1987), owing to the silt size  $(<20\mu \mathrm{m})$  of the gypsum crystals. They have a pinkish-white colour, and they are rupture-resistant when dry and friable when moist (Herrero et al., 2009). Due to their small size they can be best observed by SEM. In thin sections, they appear as faint yellow masses in plane-polarised light (Fig. 2B), with an almost undifferentiated b-fabric in cross-polarised light, showing only few clearly birefringent spots (Fig. 2A) (Porta & Herrero, 1988, 1990). SEM observations confirm a predominantly lenticular crystal habit (Fig. 2C). Similar materials have been described by Warren (1982), Pankova and Yamnova (1987), Watson (1988) and Amit and Yaalon (1996). Their microfabric corresponds to hypergypsic or hologypsic microcrystalline (Stoops & Poch, 1994).

Microcrystalline gypsum horizons are interpreted as being formed by in situ alteration of gypeous materials such as gypsum rock (Herrero, 1991; Artieda, 1996, 2013) or by transformation along the surface of pedogenic gypsum or petrogypsic horizons (Stoops & Ilaiwi, 1981). Massive accumulations can form by replacement of coarse-grained

gypsum by fine-grained gypsum, proceeding from grain boundaries, similar to micritisation in calccrete development (Aref, 2003). Microcrystalline gypsum forms by quick dissolution/reprecipitation processes, which would hinder ion migration to gypsum nucleation sites, thus promoting precipitation of multiple small crystals. Microcrystalline horizons have also been identified in terrace or alluvial fan deposits (Herrero et al., 1996; Lebedeva et al., 2015) and also as layers between limestone strata at the top of calcareous platforms (Artieda, 1996). These horizons are commonly found at such surface positions, because microcrystalline textures are more likely to develop in zones of high water potential gradient.

# 3.3 Rupture-Resistant Gypsic Materials

Rupture resistance (Soil Survey Staff, 1993) seems to be a better suited concept than cementation when applied to gypsiferous soils, as discussed by Herrero and Porta (2000) and

Herrero (2004). Rupture-resistant behaviour occurs when gypsum crystals interlock, giving rise to a xenotopic fabric, typical of some petrogypsic horizons (El-Sayed, 1993; Stoops & Poch, 1994), a characteristic reflected in the WRB classification (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015) and in the Russian system (arzyk horizon; Minashina & Khaknazarov, 1988). These horizons, composed of interlocking anhedral crystals (Fig. 3), can be extremely porous, with a crumb or sugarlike appearance in the field. They can also be either continuous or discontinuous, the latter with gypsum occurring in the form of pockets or pendants (Poch, 1992; Artieda, 1996; Toomanian et al., 2001; Hamdi-Aissa, 2002). Coarse-crystalline gypsum materials form the groundmass when gypsum precipitates at slow rates from shallow water bodies due to evaporation of sulphate-bearing waters (Yamnova & Pankova, 2013). Large lenticular gypsum crystals, with highly corroded boundaries, can be found 'floating' in a more fine-grained groundmass of microcrystalline or lenticular gypsum, resulting in a porphyrotopic fabric (Aref, 2003).

In the case of pendants, elongated anhedral crystals, perpendicular to the base of the gravel grains, interlock to form a dense fabric (Amit & Yaalon, 1996). Similar features have been described for compact horizons in palaeosols, characterised by elongated vertically oriented gypsum crystals forming a spongy mass, sometimes with stony inclusions varying in size (Gubin, 1984; Verba & Yamnova, 1997). These features are

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/1fb71a56-1d2f-42e3-acb6-03edfea71363/382bec057cc9e2facddf4141cd6b0ddaa32abd6bbb4ba8d01b115dc8775bf636.jpg)

similar to those of travertinic gypsum (Artieda, 1996) and to those in soils with gypsum threads (Toomanian et al., 2001). Travertinic gypsum is highly porous  $(\mathrm{up} > 50\%)$  and made up of gravel of various types, including gypsum fragments with clear dissolution features. Gypsum between these gravels occurs as inequigranular hypidiotopic mosaics, together with patches of microcrystalline lenticular gypsum and with lenticular or anhedral gypsum along the sides of the gravel particles (Artieda, 1996). Differences between hypergypsic and petrogypsic horizons in the same profile are discussed by Herrero et al. (2009).

Other occurrences described by some authors as petrogypsic horizons have a microcrystalline gypsum fabric (e.g., Chen, 1997; Aref, 2003). This is not in disagreement with the hypothesis of interlocking of crystals as the cause of cementation, because the small crystal size does not allow direct observation of crystal boundaries.

# 3.4 Aeolian Gypsic Materials

Aeolian gypsumarenites are commonly characterised by mixtures of gypsum crystals and rounded clay aggregates (Fig. 4; see also Mees et al., 2012). They are the result of reworking of loose gypsum deposits that can become disrupted by salt growth (Bowler, 1976, 1983; Watson, 1983; Warren, 1986; Khalaf et al., 2014). They may occur as laminated deposits with alternating layers of lenticular crystals (Magee, 1991) and also as uniform sand consisting of slightly rounded gypsum crystals. Warren (1982) ascribes the lenticular crystal habit to partial dissolution of wind-blown prismatic precursors. In these arid environments, gypsum behaves more as a clast than as a soluble material. Aeolian gypsum deposits with associated palaeosols can be preserved in the rock record and used to interpret palaeoenvironments (Hamdi-Aissa et al., 2002; Lawton & Buck,

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/1fb71a56-1d2f-42e3-acb6-03edfea71363/c85b1a9679ed36827109a4087e27b4ef54b0f872de1a15f43546a2926bb268c0.jpg)

2006; Khalaf et al., 2014). Possible confusion with deposits formed by water sorting along the margins of sabkhas (Stoops & Ilaiwi, 1981) should be kept in mind.

Gypsiferous dust from terrestrial sources (Amit et al., 1993; El-Sayed, 1993; Buck & Van Hoesen, 2002; Buck et al., 2011; Boixadera et al., 2015), as well as marine aerosols and sulphur-rich volcanic ashes (Podwojewski, 1994), has been claimed as the origin of pedogenic gypsum in several environments.

# 4. Pedofeatures

Gypsic pedofeatures are morphologically classified as intrusive (Stoops, 2003) because the amount of incorporated groundmass material is generally very small. Gypsic pedofeatures include infillings, coatings, nodules, and crystals and crystal intergrowths. These types are commonly found together in the same horizon. Their shape in various 2D cross sections in a single sample generally allows identification of their 3D morphology. Various terms have been used for some gypsic pedofeatures, which complicate comparisons between studies.

All variants of gypsum pedofeatures may be found in soils affected by fluctuations of the groundwater table (Yamnova, 1990; Verba, 1996; Yamnova & Pankova, 2013) but also in relation to the depth of the wetting front in a leaching environment (Boixadera et al., 2015). The crystal morphology seems to be related to the distance from the water table, in the sense of increasing crystal size, from microcrystalline gypsum at the top to coarse-grained closer to the water table (Pankova & Yamnova, 1980, 1987; Minashina & Khaknazarov, 1988; Verba, 1990). In the zone of complete water saturation, the largest gypsum crystals are formed, without dissolution features and with indications of enlargement of crystals formed during an earlier growth stage. They occur as infillings in almost all large voids, resulting in dense complete infillings that plug all pores (Lim et al., 1975). In contrast, gypsum crystals are larger and more abundant in the upper part of some Vertisol profiles than in lower parts (Podwojewski, 1995).

# 4.1 Infillings and Coatings

Infillings and coatings are clearly pedogenic since they are accumulations in pores or around coarse grains or rock fragments. Commonly, the presence of gypsum-saturated groundwater, under a non-percolating soil water regime, creates the conditions for precipitation of gypsum in macropores and the formation of these pedofeatures.

Infillings are normally composed of lenticular crystals, which can eventually form mosaic intergrowths. Infillings composed of non-lenticular crystals have been observed by Mees (1999) and Mees and De Dapper (2005). The infillings may be dense complete (Fig. 5A), dense incomplete (Fig. 5B), loose continuous or loose discontinuous (Fig. 5C). Some of these types of infillings may occur in root channels (Aref, 2003). The constituent crystals of dense infillings can be perpendicular to the pore walls (Brock-Hon et al.,

2012). Structures with a crescent fabric, described earlier as a groundmass feature, are in fact infillings, formed by biological activity (Fig. 5D).

Miedema et al. (1974) use the term 'crystal tubes' for gypsum in channels, based on terminology of Brewer (1964). Caldwell (1976), Jacobson et al. (1988) and Magee (1991) use similar terms for the same features. They have also been described as 'vermiform gypsum' (e.g., Porta & Herrero, 1988; Herrero et al., 1992; Artieda, 1996; Poch et al., 1998; Porta, 1998). Other authors use 'pseudomycelia' (Stoops & Ilaiwi, 1981), which might in fact be best confined to calcium carbonate accumulations (Porta & Herrero, 1988).

Gypsum coatings are much more rare than infillings. Aznar et al. (2013) describe coatings of lenticular gypsum that are interpreted as recrystallisation, along pores, of gypsum that was part of the parent material. Coatings of hypidiotopic and xenotopic gypsum along pore walls have also been reported by Boixadera et al. (2015), Lebedeva and Konyushkova (2016), Pérez-Lambán et al. (2016) and Scalenghe et al. (2016). Dultz and Kuhn (2005) attribute a biological origin to gypsum coatings associated with roots, where they show an increase in crystal size with distance from the root, together with a change in crystal morphology from equant to tabular and lenticular. In other cases the reverse trend is observed, as for gypsum rhyzoliths in Mediterranean loesslike

materials (Boixadera, pers. comm.), corresponding to microcrystalline gypsum infillings with associated hypocoatings composed of coarser lenticular gypsum (Fig. 6A to C). Ryzoliths described by other authors (Khechai & Daoud, 2016) consist of impregnative hypocoatings along root channels in sandy materials. The formation of gypsum coatings around roots can be rather fast, as observed for Caspian lowland soils (Fig. 6D; Lebedeva & Konyushkova, 2010). Fast growth is also apparent for gypsum crystals precipitated in roots of nursery-grown pine seedlings (Carey et al., 2002). Coatings in pores other than those occupied by roots consist of lenticular gypsum, where no root action is assumed to influence the crystallisation process, although being pores they can act as a preferential precipitation site (Fig. 7A). Lebedeva et al. (2015) describe gypsum coatings covered by silty coatings around vesicles in topsoils of extremely arid, saline soils in Kazakhstan, but their genesis is not clear.

Thin gypsum crusts covering the soil surface can be considered as a type of coating. Aref et al. (2014) describe gypsum crusts in sebkhas that are composed of elongated prismatic gypsum crystals and swallowtail twins growing perpendicular to microbial laminae. A relationship between cyanobacteria and gypsum precipitation in saline soil crusts was suggested by Canfora et al. (2016).

Another type of coating consists of pedogenic gypsum along the sides of gypsum rock fragments. These fragments sometimes show dissolution features along the top and gypsum coatings along the base (Fig. 7B). Gypsum coatings without a fixed orientation have also been observed. Pendants are a relatively common type of coating, described in an earlier section. Khademi and Mermut (2003) and Lebedeva et al. (2015) describe large pendants, composed of randomly oriented lenticular and equant crystals that formed partly in channels and planar voids, produced by downward movement of water.

# 4.2 Nodules

Gypsum nodules are probably formed by gypsum precipitation from a single point and can be polyphasic. Processes of dissolution-precipitation affecting a gypsic parent material can also produce nodules. The constituent crystals of nodules show a variety of fabrics, but a lenticular hypidiotopic fabric is most widespread (Fig. 8). Buck and Van Hoesen (2002) describe small round aggregates composed of small  $(0.5 - 3\mathrm{mm})$  gypsum crystals of different habits, initially assumed to have been produced by actinomycetes. In a later study, it was found that these pedofeatures can form without any biological interaction (Buck et al., 2006; see also Verba & Yamnova, 1997; Yamnova & Golovanov, 2010a). Microcrystalline gypsum nodules (Fig. 2D), formed by recrystallisation, have been described for soils on gypsum-rich parent materials (Aznar et al., 2013). Nodules composed of fanlike or rosettelike aggregates of lenticular gypsum crystals have been described for gypeous palaeosols (Pérez-Lambán et al., 2016), Technosols (Heidari & Asadi, 2015) and Vertisols (Podwojewski, 1994).

# 4.3 Crystals and Crystal Intergrowths

In the groundmass of gypeous soils it is common to find scattered gypsum crystals, with sizes between  $20\mu \mathrm{m}$  and some millimetres with a variety of crystal morphologies. According to Mees et al. (2012), synsedimentary gypsum in ephemeral saline lake

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/1fb71a56-1d2f-42e3-acb6-03edfea71363/bcb0977418f0265226648b4314dd430948ca3374e1f60b5dfdabe449c74e0846.jpg)

deposits can be distinguished from diagenetic gypsum by layered fabrics with variations in gypsum crystal morphology, size and/or abundance, often with horizontal alignment and with occasional occurrences of grading, without any indications of clastic reworking. Other features include reverse grading and vertical changes in crystal morphology. The same authors indicate that when the layered structure is missing, the occurrence of non-lenticular habits can be a criterion for the recognition of synsedimentary gypsum.

The most common crystal habit of gypsum in the groundmass of soils is lenticular, a habit that has also been recognised to develop subaqueously in salt lake basins (Mees et al., 2012). Occurrences that formed within the groundmass often contain groundmass-derived impurities, often as thin bands (dust lines) that are either parallel to the crystal faces or not, corresponding to earlier growth stages.

These isolated crystals form not only by in situ crystallisation from gypsum-saturated water but also by disruption of infillings and coatings by animal activity or other processes, incorporating them into the groundmass (Stoops et al., 1978). In some cases, the crystals grow at the expense of gypsum rock fragments, which act as nuclei. These overgrowths are generally in optical continuity with the fragment, which can be partly lined by impurities (Fig. 9A). Plate-shaped fragments can be bent by the pressure exerted between crystals that develop along its surface (Fig. 9B).

Zonation within gypsum crystals may be used as a record of previous growth stages. It can develop in dry or ephemeral saline lake environments, where seasonal variations in groundwater level promote discontinuous growth of the crystals. Mees (1999) and Mees et al. (2012) observed non-lenticular growth stages within lenticular gypsum, which show lateral extension in directions within the plane of flattening from tabular to lenticular habits. These are interpreted as a record of variations of environmental conditions during gypsum growth.

Very coarse crystals or crystal intergrowths (up to  $50~\mathrm{cm}$ ) are described by various field terms, including desert roses. Their formation is related to conditions with an oscillating groundwater table, present-day or relict, whereby gypsum crystallises at or just above the water table (Watson, 1985; Samy & Metwally, 2012). Their occurrence has also been related to waterlogging in other studies (Tolchel'nikov, 1962; Stoops & Ilaiwi, 1981; Pankova & Yamnova, 1987). In extreme aridic desert soils of Mongolia starlike arrangements (roses) of lenticular crystals have been described as a result of exchange reactions (Lebedeva et al., 2009).

Depending on the texture of the host material, these coarse crystals may show a poikilotopic fabric, with important amounts of sand and host sediment inclusions (Masson, 1955; Tolchel'nikov, 1962; Watson, 1985; Aref, 2003; Fitzpatrick et al., 2014; Khalaf et al., 2014). Twinning, both swallow-tail and other types, has also been reported (Carenas et al., 1982; Aref et al., 2014; Basyoni & Aref, 2015) and might be most common in saline environments.

# 5. Other Features Common in Soils With Gypsum

# 5.1 Dissolution Features

Dissolution features can characterise gypsum in irrigated soils. Decomposition, preservation and development of gypsum crystals in such soils have been studied not only for virgin and reclaimed soils (Gagarina et al., 1988; Gracheva et al., 1988; Gubin & Kovda, 1988, Verba et al., 1995; Lebedeva & Konyshkova, 2011) but also in laboratory experiments (Ramazanov & Lim, 1981; Halitim & Robert, 1987; Verba & Deviatykh, 1992). Irrigation-induced dissolution of gypsum in the upper part of gypsum horizons can occur simultaneously with illuviation of carbonates or clay, so that gypsum crystals become coated and their further dissolution is hindered (Minashina, 1964, 1973). This phenomenon has been observed in various studies (Lim et al., 1975; Yamnova, 1995, 1996; Verba & Yamnova, 1997).

Under furrow irrigation, small gypsum crystals in the topsoil are dissolved, and when irrigation is long lasting the larger lenticular crystals are dissolved as well (Ramazanov & Lim, 1981; Verba et al., 1995; Verba & Yamnova, 1997). Corrosion of the crystals is revealed by SEM observations: the outer faces become fissured, and the crystals undergo gradual decay along cleavage planes (Fig. 10). The crystals also become rounded. In experiments with monoliths percolated by large volumes of water, the initially compact gypsic horizons became porous and friable, and secondary tabular crystals were formed in voids in all subsurface horizons (Verba & Deviatykh, 1992). Alternative dissolution and reprecipitation under contrasted rainfall regimes as in Mediterranean climates leads to neoformation of lenticular gypsum crystals on lithogenic gypsum (Bellanca & Neri, 1993; Laya et al., 1993; Pérez-Lambán et al., 2016).

In an SEM study of diagenesis of gypsum sands, Schenk and Fryberger (1988) found that gypsum dissolution in the capillary fringe and below the watertable creates

crystallographically controlled elongate, prismatic etch pits on the surface of gypsum grains.

Void pseudomorphs after gypsum have been used as palaeoclimatic indicators of changes from arid to more humid conditions (Mestdagh et al., 1999) or of changes in drainage conditions (Junyent et al., 2012). Depending on the original mode of occurrence, they can be starlike (Mestdagh et al., 1999) or lenticular (Hamdi-Aissa, 2002). These mouldic voids have been described for the upper part of gypsic horizons (Verba & Yamnova, 1997; Gagarina, 2004) (Fig. 11A), as well as for surface horizons (Poch et al., 2004, 2009). When the groundmass is not calcitic, porostriation may be visible along the sides of these lenticular voids (Fig. 11B).

Microtomography has shown the possibility to study the gypsum leaching stages and evolution of porosity in 3D (Yamnova & Abrosimov, 2013).

# 5.2 Calcite and Other Pseudomorphs

Micritic or microsparitic calcite pseudomorphs after gypsum are quite frequent in soils from arid and semiarid areas (Feofarova, 1956; Yarilova, 1958; Carter & Inskeep, 1988; Gumuzzio & Casas, 1988; Sullivan, 1990; Stoops & Delvigne, 1990; Gerasimova et al., 1996; Verba & Yamnova, 1997; Mestdagh et al., 1999; Hamdi-Aissa, 2002; Artieda, 2004; Golovanov et al., 2005; Artieda et al., 2012; Yamnova, 2016) (Fig. 12). They are interpreted

as indicators of a more arid climate in the past, followed by more humid conditions. High biological activity (higher  $\mathrm{pCO}_2$ ) have been assumed to promote dissolution of gypsum and substitution by calcite. The process normally progresses from the sides of the crystal and along cleavage planes.

Sullivan (1990) considers two possible mechanisms for the formation of these pseudomorphs: (i) dissolution of gypsum followed by calcite precipitation in the void pseudomorph, and (ii) replacement of gypsum by calcite. The former could explain occurrences of pseudomorphs in the groundmass, with the voids acting as moulds, but

not occurrences as loose infillings in pores. The second mechanism is supported by the occurrence of partially replaced crystals (Thompson et al., 1991; Stoops, 2003).

Replacement of gypsum by a more soluble mineral, such as halite, has also been proposed (Hussain & Warren, 1989). Pseudomorphs reported for pre-Quaternary deposits, including quartz pseudomorphs after lenticular gypsum (e.g., El Khoriby, 2005), are generally not pedogenic.

# 6. Discussion and Conclusions

The most widely used soil classification systems, Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 2014) and WRB (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015), define gypsum and petrogypsic horizons on the basis of the gypsum content, and both systems require 'secondary visible gypsum' to be greater than  $1\%$  by volume. The WRB system also lists micromorphological characteristics of groundmass, micromass, microstructure and nodules for the petrogypsic horizon. This enumeration cannot be exhaustive because new forms are likely to be found as soil science advances.

When reading the definitions of gypsum and petrogypsic horizons of Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 1999), some researchers may get the erroneous idea that the mere increase in gypsum content leads to cementation. In WRB (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015), the petrogypsic horizon does not require a higher gypsum content than the gypsum horizon, but it is described as having a compacted microstructure with only a few cavities, with a matrix composed of densely packed lenticular gypsum crystals mixed with a small amount of detrital material. However, depending on the host material and other factors, enrichment with gypsum may cause either disaggregation of the original material or an increase of its cohesion (Plet-Lajoux et al., 1971; Artieda, 1996, 2004). Indeed, although most hypergypsic horizons have a high rupture resistance when dry, the criteria for cementation are not fulfilled, because they are formed by individual crystals. Gypsum micromorphology may also be applied to soil mapping and soil classification, as different micromorphological features correspond to different soil types (Yamnova & Golovanov, 2010b; Golovanov & Yamnova 2013).

In studies of soil genesis, micromorphology is a powerful tool for determining a pedogenic origin for gypsum, despite the difficulties pointed out in this chapter. In addition, micromorphology can also help to understand and predict the behaviour of soils containing gypsum for agricultural, environmental and civil engineering land uses, as well as in geoarcheology.

# 1. Introduction

In this chapter, the significance of micromorphological features of soluble salt occurrences in soil environments is discussed. It is largely confined to evaporite minerals in soils of arid regions, exclusive of gypsum (see Poch et al., 2018). Sulphate minerals that formed in a context of sulphide oxidation are treated elsewhere (Mees & Stoops, 2018). The morphology, type of aggregation and mode of occurrence are discussed for various mineral species, listed in Table 1. This table includes some information about optical properties as an aid for mineral identification in thin sections, but for more detailed information the reader is referred to other publications (e.g., Braitsch, 1971; Arnold, 1984; Fleischer et al., 1984).

The micromorphological study of salt minerals in soils can be complicated by a number of specific problems that are not encountered for most other soil materials. Firstly, salt minerals may crystallise during drying of moist samples (e.g., Hanna & Stoops, 1976; Kooistra, 1983), which is generally required for thin section preparation. Secondly, soils containing hydrated salts can become unstable during transport, storage or further handling (e.g., Driessen & Schoorl, 1973; Tursina & Yamnova, 1987; Vizcayno et al., 1995). Dehydration during SEM analysis, due to vacuum conditions or interaction with the electron beam, is one example of this problem (Shayan & Lancucki, 1984; Doner & Lynn, 1989), which can be avoided by using ESEM equipment (e.g., Rodriguez-Navarro & Doehne, 1999). Thirdly, partial or complete dissolution of salts can occur during thin section preparation, either during impregnation (Hanna & Stoops, 1976; Stoops et al., 1978; Kooistra, 1983; Courty et al., 1989; Stoops & Delvigne, 1990) or at a later stage during cutting or grinding (Eswaran et al., 1983; Allen, 1985). Despite these practical problems, micromorphological techniques have been successfully applied in various studies of salt-affected soils.

In this chapter, the three soluble salts for which most micromorphological data are available are first discussed (halite, thénardite, blödite), illustrating various interpretations that have been given to microscopic and submicroscopic features of salt occurrences in soils. This is followed by paragraphs about other highly soluble salts (chlorides, sulphates, carbonates, nitrates), about bassanite and anhydrite, and about poorly soluble sulphate minerals (celestine, kalistrontite, baryte). Finally, mineral assemblages are briefly discussed.

The first to describe the presence of salts (halite) in soil thin sections was probably Valerien Agafonoff (Agafonoff, 1935/1936), whose pioneering work on soil micromorphology deserves much wider recognition. Next came the work of Iraida Feofarova in

Russia, which included the study of salt minerals in density separates (Feofarova, 1958). Other early investigations, using thin section and SEM observations, were done in the 1970s and early 1980s, in Wageningen (e.g., Driessen, 1970; Vergouwen, 1981a), Bondy (Cheverry et al., 1972), Ghent (e.g., Stoops, 1974; Eswaran et al., 1980) and Moscow (e.g., Tursina et al., 1980; Shoba et al., 1983). The petrographical study of bassanite and anhydrite in soil-related environments became important around the time of the discovery of anhydrite in recent sabkha deposits (e.g., Kinsman, 1966). The earliest micromorphological descriptions of the poorly soluble sulphates that are covered by this review date from the 1970s (e.g., Lynn et al., 1971; Barzanji & Stoops, 1974), but they have only more recently been the subject of specific investigations.

# 2. Halite

Halite in soils occurs mainly as coatings or cements composed of anhedral crystals, which is observed both in thin sections (Tursina et al., 1980; Tursina & Yamnova, 1987; Shahid & Jenkins, 1994; Mees, 2003; Smith et al., 2004; Mees & Singer, 2006) and in SEM images (Driessen, 1970; Eswaran & Carrera, 1980; Eswaran et al., 1980, 1983; Vergouwen, 1981a; Eswaran, 1984; Gerasimova et al., 1996) (Fig. 1A). The general absence of well-developed crystal faces has been related to the strongly hygroscopic nature of halite, resulting in partial dissolution following the absorption of water (Eswaran & Carrera, 1980; Eswaran et al., 1980); this aspect of halite behaviour can be investigated using ESEM and low-temperature SEM (cf. Wierzchos et al., 2012). A lack of euhedral forms can be expected for occurrences of highly soluble salts unless they formed very recently (e.g., Buck et al., 2006), but xenotopic fabrics are clearly exceptionally common for halite in soils.

Euhedral to subhedral cubic crystals are largely confined to surface crusts or efflorescences (Eswaran et al., 1980; Vergouwen, 1981a; Herrero Isern et al., 1989; Mees & Stoops, 1991; Vizcayno et al., 1995; Joeckel & Ang Clement, 1999; Gore et al., 2000; Chernousenko et al., 2003; Mees & Singer, 2006; Buck et al., 2011) (Fig. 1B and C). These halite crystals generally formed from brines that covered the surface. However, cubic halite crystals have also been described as forming a meniscus cement in surface crusts (Pueyo Mur, 1978/1979, 1980). In salt lake studies, thick accumulations of cubic crystals, transformed to beds of interlocking equant crystals during diagenesis, have been interpreted as subarial precipitates, formed by capillary evaporation of groundwater (Bobst et al., 2001; Lowenstein et al., 2003).

Subsurface occurrences of euhedral cubic crystals are only rarely reported (Gibson et al., 1983; Amit & Yaalon, 1996; Joeckel & Ang Clement, 1999; Van Hoesen et al., 2001; Schiefelbein et al., 2002; Buck et al., 2006; Moghiseh & Heidari, 2012). They include occurrences of skeletal cubic crystals, interpreted to indicate a high degree of supersaturation (Buck et al., 2006; see also Eswaran & Drees, 2004). Another example are subhedral cubic crystals that formed within the groundmass by displacive and

partly incorporative growth (Hussain &Warren, 1989; Amit & Yaalon, 1996). Occurrences of halite crystals in the groundmass are rare, because of the high solubility of the mineral.

A subordinate but common crystal habit of halite in soils is a fibrous form (see Kooistra, 1983). The crystals are perfectly straight or curved, elongated parallel to one of the crystallographic axes. Halite of this type mainly forms along or near the soil surface, where it develops as parallel fibres, perpendicular to the surface (Hanna & Stoops, 1976; Eswaran et al., 1980; Bullock et al., 1985). Random orientations (Joeckel & Ang Clement, 1999), subsurface occurrences (Hanna & Stoops, 1976; Yamnova, 2016) and fibrous cements in sedimentary gypsum crusts (Pueyo Mur, 1978/1979) have also been described. The development of fibrous forms of halite in soil environments has been related to fast drying (Eswaran et al., 1980), capillary evaporation (Joeckel & Ang Clement, 1999) and the continual localised upward movement of soil solutions (von Hodenberg & Miotke, 1983). Fibrous halite perpendicular to a surface is also common in efflorescences on

building materials (e.g., Arnold & Kueng, 1985). In this context, it is interpreted to form in conditions with low water content of the covered material, low rates of water supply from the substrate and low evaporation rates (Arnold & Zehnder, 1985).

Shorter prismatic forms (Eswaran et al., 1980) seem to represent an intermediate stage in the development of halite fibres. Another related form is elongated crystals occurring as radial aggregates (Gore et al., 2000).

Features related to the dissolution of halite, other than xenotopic fabrics, include the presence of rounded cavities (Tursina et al., 1980; Chernousoenko et al., 2003). Joeckel and Ang Clement (1999) describe more or less cubic hollows in the centre of crystal faces as dissolution features (see also Taher & Abdel-Motelib, 2015), related to the hygroscopic nature of the mineral or to contact with dilute solutions derived from the surface. Other possible examples are pitted surfaces (Gore et al., 2000) and grooves parallel to the longitudinal axis of fibrous crystals (Joeckel & Ang Clement, 1999). Halite casts include angular indentations along the base of silty intercalations in mudstone, recording a period of near-surface displacive halite growth followed by associated halite dissolution and deposition of coarse-grained sediments during flooding (Eriksson et al., 2005).

Other features displayed by halite crystals are the presence of fluid inclusions, which is indicative of fast growth (Fig. 1C and D), and a 'stair-step' pattern along the underside of a surface crust, which has been attributed to growth rather than dissolution (Joeckel & Ang Clement, 1999). A central tubular cavity was observed for elongated halite crystals by von Hodenberg and Miotke (1983), who suggest that it acted as a capillary during crystal growth.

Partial or complete replacement of lenticular gypsum crystals by halite has been described by Hussain and Warren (1989), without commenting on the processes that would explain this relationship between unrelated phases. An association of halite with remains of roots has also been reported (Tursina et al., 1980; Tursina & Yamnova, 1987; Young, 1987; Tovey & Dent, 2002), but the significance of this feature is not apparent. Canfora et al. (2016) imply that halite distribution in surface crusts can be determined by prior biogenic gypsum precipitation around cyanobacterial filaments.

The presence of xenotopic halite coatings has a sealing effect on the underlying soil material (Driessen, 1970; Vergouwen, 1981a; Vizcayno et al., 1995). This type of halite can also act as a cement that binds soil aggregates (Hanna & Stoops, 1976; Eswaran et al., 1980; Schroeder et al., 1984; Zhang & Wang, 1987; Shahid & Jenkins, 1994; Joeckel & Ang Clement, 1999), including vadoze meniscus cements between sand grains (McLaren, 2001). The type of aggregation may vary with salt mineral composition, whereby spheroidal shapes are recognised for halite-dominated materials and a vermiform morphology for thénardite-cemented aggregates (Tursina et al., 1980).

In contrast to cementation by halite, the development of elongated halite crystals may cause separation of soil aggregates (Smith et al., 2004). This includes the uplift of surface material, if deposition of eolian material following salt formation can be

excluded (Hanna & Stoops, 1976). Crystal size has been mentioned as a factor for the degree of disruption of soil material, with large halite crystals having a stronger effect than smaller thénardite crystals (Tursina et al., 1980), although various other factors obviously also need to be considered (e.g., Rodriguez-Navarro & Doehne, 1999). A disruptive effect is implied for halite occurrences that are described as being displacive, formed within cracks in gravel-sized grains (Amit et al., 1993; Amit & Yaalon, 1996) or along cleavage planes and other structures in shales (Aref et al., 2002). In other studies, no disruptive effect of halite growth is observed, whereas a close association between halite crystals and altered quartz grain surfaces is interpreted to suggest that the main effect of the presence of salts is an increase of quartz dissolution rates (Young, 1987).

# 3. Thénardite and Mirabilite

Thénardite has been frequently observed during micromorphological investigations of saline soils. The most commonly reported crystal habit for this mineral is acicular or elongated prismatic (Driessen, 1970; Driessen & Schoorl, 1973; Stoops, 1974; Stoops et al., 1978; Pueyo Mur, 1978/1979; Eswaran & Carrera, 1980; Tursina et al., 1980; Tursina, 1981; Vergouwen, 1981a; Shoba et al., 1983; Bullock et al., 1985; Tursina & Yamnova, 1987; FitzPatrick, 1993; Shahid & Jenkins, 1994; Vizcayno et al., 1995; Gore et al., 2000; Mees, 2003; Buck et al., 2004; Hamdi-Aissa et al., 2004; Joeckel & Ang Clement, 2005; Van Ranst et al., 2008; Shahid, 2013) (Fig. 2A). The second-most common form is more or less equant bipyramidal, with lozenge-shaped cross-sections (Vergouwen, 1981a; Mees & Stoops, 1991; Shahid & Jenkins, 1994; Singer et al., 1999; Mees, 2003; Joeckel & Ang Clement, 2005; Van Ranst et al., 2008; Buck et al., 2011) (see Figs. 2D and 9A). Elongated crystals, with roughly lenticular (Mees & Stoops, 1991; Vizcayno et al., 1995), lath-shaped (Shahid & Jenkins, 1994) or irregular forms (FitzPatrick, 1993), have also been described. Plate-shaped crystal habits (Gibson et al., 1983; Joeckel & Ang Clement, 2005; Wentworth et al., 2005) seem to represent an aberrant morphology.

Stoops and Delvigne (1990) relate the development of acicular thénardite to crystal growth during fast evaporation in pores and the formation of lenticular crystals to slow evaporation within the groundmass. Similarly, Vizcayno et al. (1995) invoke a difference in speed of crystal growth for lenticular crystals and radial intergrowths of acicular crystals, without referring to the place where they form. Equant crystals with lozenge-shaped cross-sections do seem to represent the equilibrium form that also characterises subaqueous precipitates in salt lakes (e.g., Mees, 1999b).

Mirabilite has been described by a few authors using SEM analysis, reporting equant, lath-shaped and tabular crystal habits (Eswaran & Carrera, 1980; Shahid & Jenkins, 1994; Buck et al., 2004, 2011; Bisson et al, 2015). However, these observations might in most cases pertain to thénardite that formed by dehydration of mirabilite, in view of the instability of the hydrated form, for example under vacuum conditions during SEM

investigations or during impregnation for thin section preparation (e.g., Gumuzzio et al., 1982; Stoops & Delvigne, 1990; Vizcayno et al., 1995).

Thénardite formed by dehydration of mirabilite has been studied by several authors (Pueyo Mur, 1978/1979, 1980; Tursina, 1980, 1981; Tursina et al., 1980; Tursina & Yamnova, 1987; Vizcayno et al., 1995; Lebedeva-Verba et al., 2004). A difference in size and crystal habit between thénardite that formed directly from soil solutions (acicular) and thénardite formed following dehydration of mirabilite (tabular) has been reported (Tursina et al, 1980; Tursina, 2002). Pseudomorphic aggregates after large mirabilite crystals studied by Pueyo Mur (1978/1979) are composed of bipyramidal thénardite crystals that are larger in the interior than in outer parts of the same pseudomorph, and they also include groups of acicular thénardite crystals along voids in the interior. In the same study, the dehydration of fine-grained mirabilite was found to involve both pseudomorphic replacement and the growth of acicular thénardite crystals perpendicular to the surface of the affected grains.

Modes of occurrence of thénardite in soils include coatings (Tursina, 1981; Tursina & Yamnova, 1987; Mees, 2003; Mees & Singer, 2006), formed by evaporation of water contained in the peds or covering the ped surface as a thin film (Mees, 2003). The fabric of these coatings varies with depth, ranging from coatings with a constant optical orientation that represent large skeletal crystals (Fig. 2B) to coatings composed of parallel elongated crystals (Fig. 2C), recording strong vertical variations in nucleation behaviour within the same profile (Mees, 2003). Fibrous coatings also seem to have been observed during SEM studies (Gerasimova et al., 1996; Joeckel & Ang Clement, 2005). Radial aggregates of acicular crystals along the sides of pores (Stoops, 1974; Stoops et al., 1978; Eswaran & Carrera, 1980) represent a type of discontinuous coating. Another mode of occurrence is represented by loose continuous infillings composed of euhedral to subhedral crystals (Cheverry et al., 1972; Eswaran & Carrera, 1980; Tursina & Yamnova, 1987; Mees, 2003), formed in brine-filled macropores (Mees, 2003) (Fig. 2D). They can be associated with coatings or hypocoatings with a xenotopic fabric, formed by evaporation of solutions contained in the groundmass (Mees, 2003) (Fig. 2D).

Thénardite nodules include dense microcrystalline aggregates with a xenotopic fabric (Mees & Stoops, 1991) and aggregates of loosely packed crystals of thénardite and associated other minerals (Eswaran & Carrera, 1980). Some nodules are microcrystalline aggregates that are pseudomorphic after mirabilite crystals (e.g., Vizcayno et al., 1995).

Special features of thénardite occurrences in soils include an association with plant remains (Tursina et al., 1980; Tursina, 1981; Shoba et al., 1983), indications for local dissolution and reprecipitation (Gumuzzio & Casas, 1988) and the occurrence of granostriation related to the growth of mirabilite crystals (Tursina et al., 1980). Thénardite aggregates can be covered by clay, which hinders the recognition of the salts if no thin sections are used (Tursina, 1981). Driessen and Schoorl (1973) mention thénardite crystals in surface crusts showing damage caused by eolian processes or trampling.

# 4. Blödite

Blödite crystals in soils are typically elongated, with a rod-like, lath-shaped or tabular morphology (Driessen, 1970; Driessen & Schoorl, 1973; Pueyo Mur, 1978/1979; Eswaran & Carrera, 1980; Vergouwen, 1981a; Vizcayno et al., 1995; Singer et al., 1999; Van Hoesen et al., 2001; Buck et al., 2011). Equant polyhedral forms are rarer in soil environments (Feofarova, 1958; Gibson et al., 1983; von Hodenberg & Miotke, 1983; Wentworth et al., 2005; Mees & Singer, 2006). Those equant forms are characteristic of subaqueous precipitates (e.g., Mees, 1999b), which include surface crusts (Mees & Singer, 2006). Buck et al. (2006) recognise various forms in surface horizons, contributing to their view that crystal habits are most diverse at levels where conditions are most variable. As aggregate type, radial intergrowths have been reported in several studies (Pueyo Mur, 1980; Vizcayno et al., 1995; Mees & Singer, 2006; Mees et al., 2011) (Fig. 3A). A related type of

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/42d31fdc-22a8-45b8-9198-5bcb4cc4ed8d/6af5a2a5ba5c3261ef5d23fba341dfcc9938fc4aa4657e4c214674b9d985bdaf.jpg)

occurrence are fan-like aggregates with upward or downward widening (Mees et al., 2011; Rodríguez-Ochoa et al., 2012), recording poor nucleation followed by growth in a direction controlled by brine availability (Mees et al., 2011) (Fig. 3B). Other examples of aggregate types are groups of parallel crystals (Pueyo Mur, 1978/1979) and small round aggregates of randomly oriented crystals (Buck et al., 2006).

Blödite-dominated salt crusts are composed of overlapping or intergrown crystals, suggesting that they have a strong sealing effect on the underlying soil (Driessen, 1970; Driessen & Schoorl, 1973; Eswaran & Carrera, 1980). In contrast, Vergouwen (1981a) reports a high total porosity for blödite-rich crusts, composed of loosely stacked crystals. Driessen (1970) recognised the presence of blödite coatings in pores within a blödite-dominated crust, which further reduces its porosity. A second generation of blödite in pores was also recognised by Eswaran and Carrera (1980), who mention a difference in morphology between these crystals and those that form the bulk of the crust, relating this difference to the availability of space.

Another type of blödite occurrence in salt efflorescences is a xenotopic cement (Vizcayno et al., 1995) (see Fig. 1B). Eswaran and Carrera (1980) illustrate the occurrence of small etch pits as dissolution features. A highly irregular surface morphology of a blödite intergrowth has been attributed to repeated dissolution and reprecipitation (Van Hoesen et al., 2001). The development of subhedral forms and of foliated crystals or aggregates, as opposed to individual or radially intergrown prismatic crystals, has been related to rapid crystallisation (Vizcayno et al., 1995). Similar conditions have been invoked to explain the formation of small round aggregates in surface crusts (Buck et al., 2006).

Blödite crystals in contact with the groundmass may contain bands with sediment inclusions, recording successive growth stages (Vizcayno et al., 1995; Mees et al., 2011).

In the soil beneath a salt crust, blödite can occur as xenotopic coatings (Mees et al., 2011), but also as impregnative nodules and hypocoatings (Vizcayno et al., 1995). A related occurrence is represented by xenotopic blödite with high concentration of groundmass material as inclusion, along the base of thénardite coatings (Mees & Singer, 2006).

# 5. Other Highly Soluble Salt Minerals

# 5.1 Chlorides

Thin section and SEM observations for halides other than halite are rare and generally inconclusive. Sylvania is difficult to distinguish from (associated) halite on the basis of crystal morphology alone, but the significantly lower refractive index of sylvite allows a distinction between both minerals. Cubic forms (Yechieli & Ronen, 1997; Gore et al., 2000), as well as a lath-like morphology (Gore et al., 2000), have been reported for sylvania in salt efflorescences, based on SEM observations. Yechieli and Ronen (1997) illustrate occurrences of bischofite and carnallite that appear to be xenotopic, but they also mention a partly euhedral morphology as an indication for mineral authigenesis. A possible bischofite occurrence, with octahedral aspect of euhedral crystals, is also reported by Bisson et al. (2015). Wongpokhom et al. (2008) illustrate an assumed calcium chloride feature. Eswaran et al. (1980) tentatively identify lath-shaped crystals associated with halite as carnallite. Kainite has been identified as equant to short prismatic crystals associated with halite in the uppermost part of a salt crust (Mees & Singer, 2006) (see Fig. 1C) and possibly as pseudohexagonal crystals in a surface crust (Buck et al., 2006).

# 5.2 Sulphates

# 5.2.1 Aphthitalite

The morphology of two reported aphthitalite occurrences in salt efflorescences is poorly documented (Frenzel, 1963; Vergouwen, 1981a). Aphthitalite is also recognised as small euhedral equant crystals in the upper part of a thin halite crust, formed from brines that covered the surface (Fig. 4A).

# 5.2.2 Burkeite

The morphology of burkeite in soil environments ranges from equant and short prismatic (Mees & Stoops, 1991) to lath- and plate-shaped (Vergouwen, 1979, 1981a; Vizcayno et al., 1995). In a salt crust from Peru (Mees & Stoops, 1991), it occurs both as coatings and infillings and as pseudomorphs after thénardite crystals, indicating late-stage development. The coatings formed preferentially along the upper side of pores, which is related to the downward movement of solutions, in agreement with other micromorphological characteristics of the crust.

# 5.2.3 Eugsterite

Eugsterite crystals are invariably acicular (Vergouwen, 1981a, 1981b; Mees & Stoops, 1991; Buck et al., 2006; Mees & Singer, 2006). These crystals partly occur in the form of radial aggregates (Mees & Singer, 2006; Mees et al., 2011) (Fig. 4B). In SEM-EDS studies, eugsterite can be difficult to distinguish from acicular forms of compositionally related glauberite (Buck et al., 2011; Bisson et al., 2015).

# 5.2.4 Glauberite

Glauberite typically forms thick tabular crystals in salt lake deposits (e.g., Mees, 1999b; Mees et al., 2011). The same crystal habit is recognised for secondary glauberite appearing within moulds of larger synsedimentary glauberite crystals (Mees, 1998). Other occurrences reported in the same study are xenotopic, including glauberite intergrowths surrounding gypsum crystals that were partly transformed to bassanite and anhydrite (see Fig. 5A). In soils, glauberite crystals can have the same tabular shape as

they do in salt lake deposits (see Fig. 4B), but they can also be plate-shaped (Shahid & Jenkins, 1994), equant (Schiefelbein et al., 2002) or acicular (Feofarova, 1958; Pueyo Mur, 1980; Tursina et al., 1980; Hamdi-Aissa et al., 2004; Shahid, 2013). Tursina and Yamnova (1987) report acicular to equant forms. Benayas et al. (1992) tentatively identify spherulites in pores as glauberite aggregates. Lebedeva-Verba et al. (2004) mention the occurrence of glauberite around thénardite crystals, but it is not clear whether the identification of these and other reported minerals (polyhalite, trona) was confirmed by other methods.

# 5.2.5 Magnesium Sulphates

Hexahydrite, epsomite, kieserite and starkeyite are the only magnesium sulphates for which micromorphological observations have been reported. Hexahydrite crystals

generally have a tabular pseudohexagonal form, as observed in SEM images (Stoops et al., 1978; Eswaran & Carrera, 1980; Vergouwen, 1981a; Van Hoesen et al., 2001; Hamdi-Aissa et al., 2004; Buck et al., 2006). In a subaqueously deposited blödite-dominated crust, hexahydrite occurs as partly fibrous aggregates that formed in part by transformation of blödite (Mees & Singer, 2006). Buck et al. (2011) report an occurrence of massive fine-grained hexahydrite affected by cracking due to dehydration. Ducloux et al. (1994) describe acicular and lath-shaped crystals, showing parallel alignment in some parts, identified as either hexahydrite or epsomite. EPSomite should be expected to become unstable after sampling or during SEM analysis. EPSomite crystals have been described as lath-shaped (Gore et al., 2000), prismatic (Lebedeva & Konyushkova, 2011) and anhedral (Shayan & Lancucki, 1984). Lebedeva and Konyushkova (2011) report a possible occurrence of tabular kieserite crystals. An efflorescence from Congo contains microcrystalline iron-rich starkeyite aggregates with a mosaic-like texture, but this mineral may have formed by dehydration after sampling (Van Tassel, 1958).

# 5.2.6 Kogarkoite

Kogarkoite has been reported for fluorine-rich environments, as tabular (Darragi et al., 1983) or bipyramidal (Van Ranst et al., 2008) pseudohexagonal crystals.

# 5.2.7 Konyaite

Konyaite occurs as elongated plate-shaped crystals with a pseudohexagonal form (Shayan & Lancucki, 1984). In another study, konyaite was observed to form rounded aggregates of plate-shaped crystals (Ducloux et al., 1994).

# 5.2.8 Syngenite

Syngenite has been reported to occur as acicular to tabular crystals in a salt efflorescence on a rock face (Frenzel, 1963). In a similar context, acicular syngenite forms the upper part of a salt crust on sandstone, whereby syngenite is assumed to have formed from solutions that ascended through the lower part of the crust, composed of gypsum (Schweigstillova et al., 2005). In soil environments, syngenite has been recognised as predominantly elongated crystals along the sides of gypsum crystals (Fig. 4C) and glauberite crystals (Timimoun, Algeria; Mees, unpublished data), formed by an interaction of those minerals with concentrated potassium-rich brines.

# 5.3 Sodium Carbonates

Trona generally has an acicular or lath-shaped crystal habit (Vergouwen, 1981a; Bullock et al., 1985; Mees & Stoops, 1991; FitzPatrick, 1993; Shahid & Jenkins, 1994; Vizcayno et al., 1995; Owen et al., 2008; Taher & Abdel-Motelib, 2015). This morphology, as well as the random to radial arrangement of the crystals, contributes to a high porosity of trona efflorescences (Vergouwen, 1981a). Skeletal trona crystals are assumed to have formed by rapid crystal growth (Datta et al., 2002; see also Jones & Renaut, 1996).

The morphology of nahcolite and natron has hardly been documented for soil environments (Shahid & Jenkins, 1994; Smith et al., 2004). Small pirssonite crystals have been recognised as possible pseudomorphic and non-pseudomorphic replacement products of calcium carbonates (Mees & Stoops, 1991). Pedogenic gaylussite has been described as occurring in the form of large elongated subhedral crystals with ground-mass material as inclusion (Mees & Stoops, 1990; see also Rodríguez-Ochoa et al., 2012). Gaylussite, together with trona, is also mentioned as a component observed for crusts from the Lake Chad area (Cheverry et al., 1972).

# 5.4 Nitrates

Little information is available on nitrate mineral occurrences in soil environments. Thin section observations of complex nitrate ores (e.g., Searl & Rankin, 1993; Pueyo et al., 1998; Collao et al., 2002), as well as descriptions of the morphology of specific minerals (e.g., Ericksen & Mrose, 1970; Mrose et al., 1970), are available for the Chilean nitrate deposits, but the pedogenic nature of these formations is not always apparent. The four nitrate minerals that have been reported for this type of setting are niter, nitratine, humberstonite and darapskite. Figure 4D shows an occurrence of microcrystalline humberstonite aggregates in a surface crust from a sabkha environment.

# 6. Bassanite and Anhydrite

The presence of bassanite and anhydrite is not uncommon at or near the land surface in arid regions. They include occurrences in near-surface settings that are not explicitly identified as soil environments but which show relevant micromorphological features. It should be kept in mind that bassanite in thin sections can be an artifact of heating during thin section preparation (Agafonoff, 1935/1936; Milton, 1942; Parfenova & Yarilova, 1965, 1977; Artiedo Cabello, 1996), which is a possibility that has been mentioned for bassanite occurrences in soil samples by several authors (Bullock et al, 1985; Stoops & Delvigne, 1990; FitzPatrick, 1993; Porta, 1998). The instability of gypsum or bassanite may also account for the lack of correspondence between XRD results and thin section or SEM observations (e.g., Miller et al., 1989).

Bassanite and anhydrite in soils mainly form by dehydration of gypsum. This process is recognised by the occurrence of these minerals along the sides of gypsum crystals, representing a pellicular alteration pattern (Fig. 5A). Bassanite-anhydrite successions away from the gypsum core suggest that bassanite is an intermediate phase in the transformation of gypsum to anhydrite (Moiola & Glover, 1965; Arakel, 1980; Mees, 1998) (Fig. 5A). The dehydration products of gypsum are generally composed of parallel fibres (Stoops et al., 1978; Simón et al., 1980; Eswaran et al., 1983; Smykatz-Kloss et al., 1985; Moghiseh & Heidari, 2012; Khalaf et al., 2014; Basyoni & Aref, 2015), parallel to the (010) cleavage direction of gypsum (Hunt et al., 1966; Stoops & Delvigne, 1990) (Fig. 5A), which is described as perpendicular to the long axis of

lenticular crystals by some authors (Dronkert, 1977; Gunatilaka et al., 1980; Tursina & Yamnova, 1987). The fibre axis is in fact parallel to a specific crystallographic orientation within the gypsum, whereby the alignment of calcium and sulphate ions is preserved in the dehydration products (Moiola & Glover, 1965; Mees, 1998). This type of topotactic replacement is also recognised for bassanite developed around sand grains that are enclosed in a gypsum crust with a poikilotopic fabric (Mees & Stoops, 2003). Another type of topotactic replacement of gypsum is represented by omongwaite formation, through interaction of gypsum crystals with highly saline solutions, resulting in surface deposits that are preserved when covered by gypsum overgrowths (Mees et al., 2008) (Fig. 5B).

The possibility of replacement of gypsum by bassanite or anhydrite through a dissolution-reprecipitation process at a non-molecular scale is suggested for some occurrences by an apparent absence of fibrous textures (Arakel, 1980; Hamdi-Aissa, 2002; Hamdi-Aissa et al., 2004) and by the development of randomly oriented or radiating bassanite/anhydrite crystals (Aref et al., 1997; Aref, 1998; Mees & De Dapper, 2005). Dissolution-reprecipitation replacement is also inferred from associations between anhydrite occurrences and dissolution features along gypsum surfaces (Shearman, 1985; Gunatilaka, 1990).

The replacement of gypsum crystals by bassanite or anhydrite can result in the formation of perfectly pseudomorphic aggregates (Bush, 1973; Gunatilaka et al, 1980; Bullock et al., 1985; Stoops & Delvigne, 1990; FitzPatrick, 1993; Golovanov et al., 2005; Yamnova & Pankova, 2013), which may enclose small corroded gypsum remnants (Arakel, 1980). Pseudomorphism has also been suggested for lamellar bassanite, assumed to have formed at high salinities in frozen ground, by dehydration of cryogenic gypsum with prominent cleavage (Vogt & Larqué, 2002). SEM observations suggest that pseudomorphic anhydrite aggregates are susceptible to collapse (Gunatilaka, 1990). Similarly, the fine crystal size and loose consistency of anhydrite aggregates have been cited to explain the scarcity of pseudomorphs by Butler (1970), who also refers to the limited coherence of the sediment enclosing the original gypsum crystals. In the same study, thin section observations of samples with pseudomorphs after lenticular gypsum crystals reveal the presence of associated moulds of those crystals, with varying degrees of infilling by anhydrite, indicating a difference in timing between gypsum dissolution and anhydrite formation.

Further anhydrite growth following pseudomorphic replacement, requiring the addition of  $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$  and  $\mathrm{SO}_4^{2-}$  ions from other sources, results in the formation of aggregates with a more irregular outline and ultimately in the development of nodules that can no longer be recognised as pseudomorphic features (Bush, 1973; Shearman, 1978). These nodules are composed of cleavage fragments, formed by the growth of lath-shaped crystals in a confined space, which results in breakage (Shearman, 1978). The continued growth of the fine-grained anhydrite nodules requires conditions or processes favouring nucleation rather than enlargement of existing crystals (Shearman, 1978).

In contrast to these models relating bassanite and anhydrite formation to dehydration of gypsum, direct precipitation of these minerals from solution has also been proposed for some occurrences. It has been invoked for anhydrite nodules by Kinsman (1966), referring to the absence of pseudomorphic aggregates and of partially replaced gypsum crystals (see also Wilson et al., 2013), and to the difference between gypsum crystals and anhydrite nodules in amount of groundmass material occurring as inclusion. In the study by Kinsman (1966), randomly oriented single anhydrite crystals and small aggregates, occurring in the groundmass away from gypsum crystals, are interpreted as representing the initial stage of anhydrite nodule development. Lack of enclosed groundmass material and co-occurrence with unaltered gypsum are also invoked by Basyoni & Aref (2015) to argue an authigenic origin of anhydrite nodules, which show parallel alignment of plate-shaped crystals along the sides as peculiar feature. Formation of bassanite as direct precipitate has been proposed for radial aggregates and clusters of randomly oriented euhedral crystals, citing micromorphological evidence for a role of high salinity and the presence of organic compounds (Khalaf et al., 2014).

Most descriptions of anhydrite and bassanite concern occurrences as crystals or nodules within the groundmass. Both minerals have also been observed as aggregates in pores (Bullock et al., 1985; Tursina & Yamnova, 1987; Shahid & Jenkins, 1994; Mees & De Dapper, 2005), where they are probably derived from a gypsum precursor (Mees & De Dapper, 2005) (Fig. 5C).

Hydration of the dehydration products around gypsum crystals can result in the development of non-topotactic microcrystalline gypsum coatings (Mees & Singer, 2006). Topotactic replacement accounts for the presence of secondary gypsum along the sides of sand grains surrounded by bassanite, enclosed in poikilotopic gypsum with the same optical orientation as the secondary gypsum (Mees & Stoops, 2003). The presence of parallel-oriented bassanite/anhydrite inclusions in gypsum crystals, related to repeated dehydration and hydration (Dronkert, 1977; Mees & De Dapper, 2005), most likely involves epitaxial gypsum growth on the gypsum core (Fig. 5D). The development of gypsum crystals enclosing small, randomly oriented and distributed anhydrite crystals, interpreted as a feature formed by dehydration (Aref, 2003), may also have involved a rehydration stage. Bassanite along the contact between gypsum crystals can be protected from hydration by the development of gypsum overgrowths (Mees & De Dapper, 2005).

Features described as rehydration products of anhydrite include lath-shaped gypsum crystals, interpreted as having formed by hydration of lath-shaped fragments of complete pseudomorphs that formed by topotactic replacement of gypsum (Gunatilaka et al, 1980; Gunatilaka, 1990). These secondary gypsum crystals can show parallel alignment, which is deformed around remaining anhydrite crystals and nodules, representing a texture that has been related to liquefaction (Gunatilaka et al, 1980; Gunatilaka, 1990). Experimental studies indicate that textural features of hydration products have an impact on the geotechnical properties of soils with calcium sulphate minerals (Azam et al., 1998; Azam, 2003).

The microcrystalline nature of the dehydration products has been seen as an indication that their formation and rehydration contributes to the development of fine-grained gypcrete on gypsum deposits (Chen, 1997). Dehydration has also been assumed to have caused the development of a spongy microstructure in surface crusts (Hamdi-Aissa, 2002; Hamdi-Aissa et al., 2004), but the mechanism behind this change is not apparent.

Anhydrite nodules that formed in near-surface environments can be preserved in the rock record, but their recognition is complicated by possible confusion with nodules that formed in other conditions (e.g., Machel & Burton, 1991). The nodules are partly preserved as quartz nodules, characterised by a length-slow fibrous quartz composition and the occurrence of small calcium sulphate inclusions (e.g., Siedlecka, 1972; Chowns & Elkins, 1974; Tucker, 1976).

# 7.1 Celestine

Celestine appears to be common in highly gypsiferous soils (Stoops et al., 1978; Eswaran & Zi-Tong, 1991), although relatively few published reports are available. The crystal morphology of celestine in soil environments is always elongated prismatic, with a lozenge-shaped cross-section and with pyramidal terminations composed of two or four crystal faces (e.g., Evans & Shearman, 1964; Barzanji & Stoops, 1974; Stoops et al., 1978; McFadden et al., 1987; Stoops, 2003) (Fig. 6A). Weathering can result in the development of parallel grooves on crystal faces (Stoops et al., 1978), and it can also account for the grooves and associated sawtooth patterns illustrated by Benayas et al. (1992).

Celestine crystals generally occur in groups, formed within the groundmass (e.g., Barzanji & Stoops, 1974; Bullock et al., 1985; Stoops & Delvigne, 1990; Rodríguez-Ochoa et al., 2012; Boixadera et al., 2015) or as infillings of pores (Stoops et al., 1978; Eswaran & Zi-Tong, 1991; Khormali, 2005) (Fig. 6B). The latter are most clearly authigenic, but the

common euhedral forms, good sorting and clustering of crystals are also indications of authigenesis (Herrero, 1991). Fan-like or radial orientation patterns (e.g., McFadden et al., 1987; El-Sayed, 2000) are another feature that has been cited as an indication of authigenic celestine formation (Barzanji & Stoops, 1974). Evans and Shearman (1964) recognised sheaf-like and more simple radiating aggregates as two distinct types of intergrowths, each associated with a specific type of gypsum, formed at different stages in the diagenesis of sabkha deposits.

The preferential occurrence of celestine in decalcified parts of the groundmass in some gypsiferous soils suggests that celestine formation is related to calcite dissolution (Barzanji & Stoops, 1974). The authors refer to associated calcite dissolution and gypsum formation, with higher strontium concentrations in carbonates than in gypsum, resulting in a local excess of Sr, in a  $\mathrm{SO}_4$ -rich environment. Herrero (1991) points out that this process is unlikely unless aragonite dissolution is involved and also found no systematic association between decalcification features and celestine occurrences in his study area. The possible role of aragonite was previously invoked by Evans and Shearman (1964), who refer to extensive dolomitisation of aragonite (and calcite) in their study area.

Hamdi-Aissa et al. (2004) describe celestine crystals occurring along the sides of gypsum crystals and as aggregates enclosed by gypsum, interpreted as an indication for co-precipitation of both minerals. Gypsum growth following celestine formation is illustrated by celestine crystals that are partly or completely enclosed by gypsum (Evans & Shearman, 1964; Barzanji & Stoops, 1974; Herrero, 1991; Stoops, 1998). Celestine occurrences within gypsum and associated anhydrite/bassanite shows that they are predictably unaffected by conditions resulting in dehydration and rehydration of calcium sulphate minerals (Hunt et al., 1966).

# 7.2 Kalistrontite

Kalistrontite occurs as microcrystalline nodules with a xenotopic fabric and as a thin discontinuous horizontal layer composed of euhedral to subhedral prismatic crystals, both developed along a lithological discontinuity below a dry lake bed (Mees, 1999a) (Fig. 7A). It encloses pedogenic lenticular gypsum crystals, demonstrating its pedogenic origin. The low solubility of kalistrontite is recorded by the presence of enclosed gypsum moulds, which are also present in the groundmass around the nodules (Fig. 7B).

# 7.3 Baryte

Baryte, which typically forms in hydromorphic conditions, displays two main types of crystal habit in soils, i.e., acicular or elongated prismatic (Lynn et al., 1971; Stoops & Zavaleta, 1978; Crum & Franzmeier, 1980; Fitzpatrick et al., 1992; Sullivan & Koppi, 1995; Wierzchos et al., 1995) (Fig. 8A) and tabular or plate-shaped with mainly hexagonal forms (Lynn et al., 1971; Stoops et al., 1978; Stoops & Zavaleta, 1978; Crum & Franzmeier, 1980; Carson et al., 1982; Dixon et al., 1982; Eswaran et al., 1983; Shoba et al., 1983;

Rognon et al., 1987; Darmody et al., 1989; Sullivan & Koppi, 1993; Eswaran & Drees, 2004). Variations in crystal habit within baryte aggregates have been noted, with tabular forms in the centre and elongated prismatic crystals in the outer parts (Stoops et al., 1978; Stoops & Zavaleta, 1978). Aggregates with fan-like and radial arrangements of the elongated or plate-shaped crystals have also been described (Shoba et al., 1983; Sullivan & Koppi, 1995; McCarthy & Plint, 2003; Cumba & Imbellone, 2004; Retallack & Kirby, 2007). The factors determining variations in crystal habit and aggregation of baryte in soil environments are unknown. Irregular forms of crystals have been related to dissolution (Sullivan & Koppi, 1995).

Euhedral morphologies of baryte in soils are an indication of authigenesis (Lynn et al., 1971; Stoops & Zavaleta, 1978). Another criterion for authigenic mineral formation is the occurrence of baryte crystals in pores (Stoops & Zavaleta, 1978; Darmody et al., 1989) (Fig. 8B and C), which has also been observed in several other studies (Lynn et al., 1971; Crum & Franzmeier, 1980; Eswaran et al., 1983; Bullock et al., 1985; Rognon et al., 1987; Sullivan & Koppi, 1995; Brock-Hon et al., 2012). Baryte occurring as nodules enclosing groundmass material is also clearly pedogenic (Retallack & Kirby, 2007; see also Jennings et al., 2015). Preferential precipitation of baryte in parts of the groundmass that are rich in fibrous clay minerals has been attributed to local moisture conditions (Brock-Hon et al., 2012). Baryte occurrences in association with other pedogenic materials, such as carbonates (Sullivan & Koppi, 1995; Brock-Hon et al., 2012), illuvial clay (Sullivan & Koppi, 1995; Clarke et al., 2016) and iron oxides (Lee & Gilkes, 2005), record differences in timing of their development (Fig. 8B to D). The presence of baryte in pores in an interval with fragments of clay coatings indicates recent baryte formation, relative to a period of clay illuviation and pedoturbation (Stoops & Zavaleta, 1978). Illuvial clay covering baryte occurrences in some parts is seen as an indication that baryte authigenesis is not a very recent short-lived process (Darmody et al., 1989).

Baryte pseudomorphs after lenticular gypsum crystals are microcrystalline aggregates with admixed micritic carbonates (Sullivan & Koppi, 1993). The replaced gypsum crystals occurred in pores, which excludes pseudomorphism by infilling of moulds formed by dissolution (Sullivan & Koppi, 1993).

An association of baryte with silicified or carbonaceous root remains has been reported in a few studies (Sullivan & Koppi, 1995; McCarthy & Plint, 1998, 2003). In several more recent publications, microscopic features are cited to argue mediation of baryte precipitation by microorganisms (Brock-Hon et al., 2012; Jennings & Driese, 2014; Jennings et al., 2015). Features of baryte occurrences whose significance is not clear include associations with spherulitic aragonite aggregates (Podwojewski, 1995) and halloysite (Brewer et al., 1983). Other examples are baryte occurrences in the centre of quartz spherulites in silcretes (Smith, 2005), baryte infillings of planar voids in manganese oxide nodules (Blackburn et al., 1975), and baryte pseudomorphs after whewellite

McKee and Brown (1977) illustrate the SEM morphology of the interior of a baryte nodule, characterised by a high microporosity and a random orientation of euhedral crystals, but this nodule is not explicitly identified as either authigenic or inherited.

# 8. Mineral Assemblages

Spatial relationships between salt mineral species, in surface crusts and subsurface horizons, can record a sequence of stages with differences in brine composition, environmental conditions or mode of mineral formation related to degree of water saturation. This can result in the consecutive formation of different minerals, with or without involving the replacement of a pre-existing phase.

Non-replacive successive mineral formation produces coatings or infillings which cover mineral occurrences that developed at an earlier stage. During SEM investigations, this type of successive mineral formation is mainly recognised by the presence of small crystals covering the surface of larger sub/euhedral crystals (e.g., blödite on thénardite and hexahydrite; Vergouwen, 1981a). Examples observed in thin sections include infillings with a different salt mineral composition than the groundmass (Cheverry et al., 1972), juxtaposed coatings of different minerals (e.g., halite on thénardite; Mees, 2003), crystals enclosed by coatings along the sides of peds (e.g., eugsterite enclosed by halite; Mees & Singer, 2006) and crystals covering another mineral without signs of alteration (Fig. 9A). Successive formation can also result in complete cementation by pervasive development of infillings, most commonly composed of halite, for example halite cementation of part of a blödite-dominated crust (Vizcayno et al., 1995) (see also Fig. 1B). Sequences of mineral formation may include a dissolution stage, which can result in the presence of crystals inside dissolution cavities (e.g., kainite in halite; Mees & Singer, 2006). A special case of cumulative

successive mineral formation is the development of layered surface crusts by subaqueous mineral formation (Mees & Stoops, 1991; Vizcayno et al., 1995; Mees & Singer, 2006).

Successive mineral formation involving replacement reactions has been recognised for various salt minerals. A common type of replacement reaction is the dehydration of hydrated minerals, as previously described for the  $\mathrm{Na - SO_4}$  and  $\mathrm{Ca - SO_4}$  systems.

A new mineral phase can also be produced by an interaction of a crystal with more concentrated solutions that involves the addition of elements. Examples of this type of replacement along the sides of a pre-existing phase include the transformation of gypsum to glauberite (Pueyo Mur, 1980), trona to burkeite (Vergouwen, 1981a), thénardite to eugsterite (Vergouwen, 1981a; Mees & Stoops, 1991), thénardite to blödite (Fig. 9B), gypsum to eugsterite (Rodríguez-Ochoa et al., 2012), and gypsum to syngenite (see Fig. 4C). Greater degrees of transformation have also been observed, resulting in complete or nearly complete pseudomorphic replacement, for example trona by burkeite (Vergouwen, 1981a) and thénardite by burkeite (Mees & Stoops, 1991). Replacement can take place during a period with subaqueous mineral formation (e.g., blödite by hexahydrite; Mees & Singer, 2006). It can also be followed by the development of overgrowths, which are in many cases composed of halite. This type of sequence is illustrated by halite enclosing thénardite crystals that are partly transformed to eugsterite (Mees & Stoops, 1991).

When paragenetic sequences are studied, the possibility of co-precipitation of certain minerals must be considered. Co-precipitation is recognised by an intimate association of two or more phases. Examples for which this process has been inferred include blödite-halite and halite-kainite associations (Vergouwen, 1981a; Mees & Singer, 2006).

Besides co-precipitation and replacive or non-replacive successive mineral formation, other events during the development of salt occurrences are recorded as well. In a salt crust from Peru, local redistribution of carbonates resulted in the development of trona-depleted thénardite-rich nodules, and salt distribution patterns in another crust are compatible with a period of leaching from the surface (Mees & Stoops, 1991). Cheverry et al. (1972) illustrate the presence of organic matter covering sodium carbonate crystals in a crust that was impregnated with organic compounds during a period of capillary evaporation, following the precipitation of trona and gaylussite from surface brines at an earlier stage.

# 9. Conclusions

Thin section studies of soil materials with soluble salts are still relatively few in number. SEM studies are more common but provide little information on some relevant aspects, such as the nature of internal features of crystals and aggregates. Many published micromorphological studies of salt occurrences are rather descriptive, with little attention for the significance of observed features.

The interpretation of variations in crystal habit and type of aggregation is hindered by a lack of experimental studies on possible controlling factors. Available results for gypsum growth, which has been intensively investigated, indicate that a great complexity should be expected. One consequence of the variable morphology of many salt minerals is that crystal shape can only be used with great care for mineral identification, which should be largely based on optical properties and supported by EDS analyses.

Micromorphology is more successful when it deals with modes of occurrence or with mineral assemblages, providing information that cannot be deduced from chemical data or XRD results. It allows a distinction between subaqueous crystal growth and mineral formation from subsurface brines, in various parts of a soil horizon (macropores, ped faces, groundmass). During the study of salt occurrences, the ephemeral nature of their presence, composition and fabric should be kept in mind.

# 1. Introduction

Phosphate finds its way into the soil by a number of pathways. It can be inherited from phosphate-rich parent materials, such as phosphorites and pegmatites (Table 1). In soils on other rock types, phosphate can be inherited as a minor constituent. The amount of total soil phosphorus in normal soil environments is low, with an average value of only  $0.05\%$  (Lindsay et al., 1989). Hydroxylapatite, referred to as apatite throughout this chapter, is the major phosphate mineral in soils. Under conditions of diagenesis, other phosphate minerals are produced, such as crandallite, montgomeryite, variscite and vivianite (see Table 1).

Petrographic and micromorphological analysis of soils and sediments have contributed significantly to the understanding of the origin and evolution of phosphate in soils and sediments. This is for example the case for environments with bog ore formation (Stoops, 1983; Landuydt, 1990; Kaczorek & Sommer, 2003) and for lake basins (Stamatakis & Koukouzas, 2001; Kaczorek & Sommer, 2003; Lücke & Brauer, 2004; Fagel et al., 2005; Sapota et al., 2006; Gamzikov & Marmulev, 2007). In studies of weathering profiles developed on marine phosphorites, bauxites, laterites, and carbonaceous and coal deposits, the microscopic study of soil phosphates has revealed a suite of Ca and Al

phosphate minerals and diagenetic pathways (Altschuler, 1973; Flicoteaux et al., 1977; Flicoteaux & Lucas, 1984; Nahon, 1991; Dill et al., 1991; Tiessen et al., 1996; Dill, 2001).

Although the mentioned occurrences unrelated to faunal activity are significant, animal inputs are considered to be the major source of soil phosphate (Altschuler, 1973; Flicoteaux & Lucas, 1984; Dill, 2001). The most obvious sources are guano (bird and bat guano), animal dung and coprolites. For example, extensive ornithogenic insular phosphate deposits are well known from throughout the world (Hutchinson, 1950; Wilson & Bain, 1976; Cullen, 1988; Gregory & Rodgers, 1989; Landis & Craw, 2003; Simas et al., 2006, 2007; Schaefer et al., 2008; Pereira et al., 2013; Villagran et al., 2013). Furthermore, anthropogenic inputs, like those of other vertebrates add P to the soil in the form of human waste, forming typical phosphatic anthropic horizons (Macphail et al., 1990, 2003; Schaefer et al., 2004). Micromorphological studies of archeological sediments and experimental strategies have demonstrated that phosphatic features can be the result of animal husbandry (e.g., stabling) and other agricultural and human activities (e.g., manuring, fertilising, waste deposition) (Bertran & Raynal, 1991; Macphail, 2000; Simpson et al., 2000; Schaefer et al., 2004; Goldberg & Macphail, 2006; Villagran et al., 2013). Even for stabiling, pens and byres, however, the major input of phosphate is not directly the original vegetal remains but their reprocessed, phosphate-rich contributions derived from animals (e.g., horses, cattle, goats and sheep; see e.g., Macphail et al., 2004). Modern chemical fertilisers are by no means the main anthropogenic input of phosphorus in soils today. A vast literature exists on the reaction of phosphate fertilisers with soils (see e.g., Bhujbal & Mistry, 1986; Lindsay et al., 1989; Beauchemin et al., 2003). However, due to the low amounts of reaction products the use of petrography is limited, with some notable exceptions (Lehr & Brown, 1958; Qureshi et al., 1978; Qureshi & Jenkins, 1987).

Micromorphological studies in cave environments represent some of the best sources of information on the accumulation and alteration of soil phosphate related to guano and anthropogenic inputs (Goldberg & Nathan, 1975; Schiegl et al., 1996; Karkanas et al., 1999, 2000, 2002; Weiner et al., 2002; Shahack-Gross et al., 2004). The alteration sequence of the phosphate minerals has been used to reconstruct the palaeochemical environment in the sediment and assess the integrity of the archeological material.

In this chapter we summarise available information about micromorphological features of phosphates in soils, regoliths and altered terrestrial sediments. Many of the studies in sediments do not follow a uniform micromorphological terminology, but we have tried to report micromorphological features using the terminology of Bullock et al. (1985) and Stoops (2003).

# 2. Phosphate Occurrences as Groundmass Components

# 2.1 Coarse Fraction

The most prominent groundmass phosphate mineral is apatite (Table 1), which is the most common phosphate mineral found in igneous and sedimentary rocks. Discrete

sand- or silt-size grains of apatite inherited from the parent rock are often found in soils. Apatite is very stable in calcareous soils but weathers easily in acidic soils and in areas of relatively intensive leaching (Walker & Syers, 1976; Retallack, 1990). In the initial stages of weathering, dissolution of apatite may lead to secondary phosphates often enriched in rare-earth elements; these mineralisations are formed along rims, edges and pits in primary apatite crystals (Banfield & Eggleton, 1989; Nedachi et al., 2005).

The second most frequent form of groundmass apatite is bone, which is common in the coarse fraction of archeological soils and sediments, and varies from whole bones to millimetre-size splinters. In thin sections, both spongy bone and cortical bone shows a ropy internal structure in cross-polarised light (XPL). Concentric layers of fibrous apatite surround voids called haversian canals, which typically appear as elliptical points in thin sections (Fig. 1A). Fish bone shows a mixture of lamellar and woven bone tissue, with clear lamellar organisation dominating in fish species with acellular bone (Fig. 1C and D) (Cohen et al., 2012). Interference colours of bone are low (first order grey) and commonly abnormal (dark brown/olive or blue) (Fig. 1B and D). However, the collagen and not the

bone mineral is responsible for the greater part of the birefringence of fresh bones. Hence, although apatite is optically uniaxial negative, the optical orientation observed for bone fragments (length fast or length slow) depends upon the preservation of the collagen (Watson, 1975). Recrystallisation of bone results in partial or total replacement of the ropy structure, with development of a mosaic-speckled b-fabric (with domains ca.  $50~{\mu\mathrm{m}}$  in diameter) (Fig. 1). In plane-polarised light (PPL), unaltered bone is typically yellow to yellowish brown, but upon heating it becomes locally blackish brown due to carbon accumulation (Hanson & Cain, 2007) and it loses its birefringence and histological structure. When heated above ca.  $650^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  (calcination) the bone shows bright white low order interference colours. Cracking is another feature associated with burning. Duration and temperature of heating have an impact on the degree of calcination but the final composition and structure of bone are influenced by temperature alone (Snoeck et al., 2014). The presence of bone, particularly burnt bone, is common in archeological soils and sediments. It is usually a reflection of human inputs (e.g., hunting, waste accumulation), although carnivore denning (e.g., hyenas) also produces high concentrations of bone fragments. In some cases, intense physical and chemical alteration of bone can produce nodular apatitic features that can hardly be identified as bone (e.g., Morras, 1983; Schaefer et al., 2004).

Apatite replacing plant ash (Fig. 2) is a common feature related to the alteration of anthropogenic combustion products by phosphate-rich solutions, most likely derived from decaying organic material such as guano. In this case, the commonly microlaminated calcitic ash is replaced by yellowish apatite with undifferentiated b-fabric. However, the general structure of the burnt layer, i.e., ashes overlying an organic/charcoal-rich or fire reddened substrate, can still be recognised. The use of micromorphological techniques is often the only way to prove that burning activities occurred in the past.

Leucophosphite and montgomeryite have been frequently found in severely altered anthropogenic combustion features (Schiegl et al., 1996; Karkanas et al., 1999, 2002). They usually occur as individual yellow, greenish or colourless spherulites, typically  $100 - 500\mu \mathrm{m}$  in diameter (Fig. 3) and as radiating acicular grains or nodules (see also Section 3) (Fig. 4). The features that relate them to the original ash are basically the same as described above for apatite-altered ash remains. The presence of these Al phosphate minerals in severely altered anthropogenic sediment indicates that apatite is not stable in this environment. Thus if bone had been present in the past, it has now been dissolved, altering the archeological record and posing problems in its interpretation (Karkanas et al., 2000).

accumulations of plate-shaped, needle-like and arrow-head crystals (Altschuler, 1973; Flicoteaux & Lucas, 1984; Nahon, 1991). They, thus form a groundmass with a crystallitic b-fabric. Detailed micromorphological studies have established a complex alteration pathway, with Al phosphates forming at the expense of apatite (Flicoteaux & Lucas, 1984). The phosphate mineral sequence is characterised by concentration of aluminium and leaching of calcium and sodium. The formation of a micromass with millisite or crandellite and then wavellite is due to leaching under conditions with permanent groundwater in a wet tropical climate (Flicoteaux & Lucas, 1984; Nahon, 1991). Undifferentiated assemblages of goethite, leucophosphite and strengite occur in the matrix and along pores in some ferruginous lateritic crusts (Tiessen et al., 1996). Phosphate minerals of the crandellite group have been also reported in other soils that

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/77459d86-2b97-4806-917b-a922ff32f88d/5834d9270656ad2a9d82662ed067f6763d731d58cecef9b1a13ebf51227e8609.jpg)

have undergone intensive leaching and weathering (Norrish, 1968; Adams et al., 1973; Dill et al., 1991). In weathered black shales, apatite forms macroscopically massive aggregates consisting of prismatic to acicular crystals, whereas crandallite appears in the form of fibrous rosettes and spherulites. In addition, Zn-rich turquoise  $(\mathrm{CuAl}_6(\mathrm{PO}_4)_4(\mathrm{OH})_8\cdot 4\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O})$  occasionally constitutes the massive cryptocrystalline matrix (Dill et al., 1991).

In weathered shell middens, secondary calcium phosphate phases form at interfaces between the phosphatic clayey micromass and unaltered bone and shells. The formation of this phosphate phase, most likely apatite, is associated with development of a microgranular structure. An illuvial origin is suggested for its formation, probably derived from alteration of overlying phosphate-rich materials such as wood ashes (Corrêa et al., 2013).

In cultivated soils, concentration of phosphate phases, presumably apatite, is observed associated with ped faces, probably related to surface addition of P-rich fertilisers (Qureshi & Jenkins, 1987). However, these concentrations are detected only by electron probe microanalysis and are not distinguished from the homogeneous clay-rich groundmass by optical microscopy.

Materials with a phosphate-dominated micromass display both undifferentiated and crystallitic b-fabrics. An undifferentiated b-fabric, in the absence of significant amounts of amorphous organometallic complexes, is an indication of the presence of apatite (Fig. 5). One of the best ways to resolve such ambiguous cases is the use of fluorescence microscopy (Altemüller & Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1990). Apatite is autofluorescent under blue light  $(450 - 500\mathrm{nm})$ , usually displaying yellow, orange-yellow or whitish colours (Fig. 6)

FIGURE 6 Apatite nodules (Ap) showing orange-yellow autofluorescence (BLF).

(Macphail et al., 2004; Goldberg & Macphail, 2006). Bright orange fine material in the form of concave meniscus-like bridges between coarse grains, in a chito-gefuric c/f-related distribution pattern, was observed for anthropogenic horizons with combustion features in sealing shelters. Based on UVL fluorescence characteristics, a phosphatic composition for the bright orange micromass was suggested. The phosphates could derive from seal remains (Villagran et al., 2013).

A number of phosphate minerals other than apatite are found both in materials from caves and soil environments. The most common are crandallite, leucophosphite, millisite, montgomeryite, strengite, taranakite, variscite, vivianite, and wavellite (Table 1). They often give a brownish, yellow, orange-yellow or grey tint to the groundmass. If confusion with other cryptocrystalline features (or amorphous or masked features) can be avoided, their presence is indicated by a groundmass with an undifferentiated b-fabric. Since all phosphate minerals are usually autofluorescent, microscopic study of fluorescence under blue light can be helpful to confirm their occurrence (Altemüller & Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1990) (Figs. 6 and 7). Nevertheless, aluminium complexes are also sometimes autofluorescent (Altemüller & Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1990; Goldberg & Macphail, 2006). In any case, it is not possible to unequivocally identify a specific phosphate mineral without the use of additional mineralogical identification techniques (e.g., XRD, FTIR, EDS, WDS). SEM studies accompanied by microprobe analysis, in particular, have proven to be invaluable in identifying some phosphate occurrences (Qureshi & Jenkins, 1987; Karkanas et al., 1999, 2000; Macphail & Goldberg, 2000, Thiry et al., 2006).

# 2.3 Guano Deposits

Guano is a by-product of animal excretion. Its characteristics depend on the type of animal and its feeding habits. Guano deposition is believed to be the most important agent of phosphate enrichment of cave deposits, some insular sediment and ornithogenic soils, producing a number of Al phosphate minerals as described below (Section 3) (Wilson & Bain, 1976; Karkanas et al, 2000, 2002; Shahack-Gross et al., 2004; Simas et al., 2007; Schaefer et al., 2008; Pereira et al., 2013; Bergadà et al., 2013).

Bird guano often has an undulating layered appearance (Hutchinson, 1950) and a spongy microstructure (Cullen, 1988) (Fig. 8). It consists of dark yellowish cryptocrystalline apatite (Fig. 9), with undifferentiated b-fabric. Microcrystalline struvite (Table 1) can be also a major constituent of fresh bird (gull) guano (Cullen, 1988; Pereira et al., 2013). It usually contains different types of inclusions, such as dissolved fine bone fragments, insect scales and plant remains, depending on the diet of the bird.

In contrast, fresh bat guano does not contain apatite. However, apatite is one of its first alteration products and occurs as groundmass material (Fig. 5), light yellow nodules (Fig. 9) or incomplete infillings of planar voids (Shahack-Gross et al., 2004; Bergadà et al., 2013). As in bird guano deposits, apatite is microcrystalline. Gypsum, chitin fragments and decayed amorphous fine plant residues are also associated with fresh bat guano. Zanin et al. (2005) observed tubular structures  $(10 - 20\mu \mathrm{m}$  in diameter) that they believe to be of microbial origin, interpreting these features as capsules of cyanobacterial filaments.

Ardealite, brushite, struvite and newberyite (Table 1) are other phosphate minerals that are related to guano (Shahack-Gross et al., 2004; Karkanas et al., 2002), but they are

FIGURE 9 Yellow cryptocrystalline apatite nodule in an altered guano deposit from Kebara Cave (Israel) (PPL). Note the curved and mammillated external surface (arrow).

rarely preserved in the sediment or soil record. Newberyite, in particular, has an acicular crystal habit and occurs as rosette-like aggregates; it has been reported in altered cave sediments from archeological sites (Karkanas et al., 2002).

The presence of recognisable guano crusts (Fig. 8) and other guano deposits indicates stable surface exposure with lack of sedimentation. Black crusts consisting of dark reddish yellow cryptocrystalline apatite are often formed in cave environments and mark periods of stabilisation and exposure of the sediment on the surface. The black colour is due to the presence of manganese and iron oxides and amorphous compounds related to the decay and mineralisation of organic matter. Microcrystalline apatite crusts have also been reported in stabling floors (Macphail et al., 2004), interbedded with layered plant fragments and fecal calcitic spherulites (Canti, 1998).

# 3. Phosphate Occurrences as Pedofeatures

Crystalline and amorphous phosphate pedofeatures include nodules, coatings, hypo-coatings and infillings. Since most of these features are difficult to identify using optical microscopy, supplementary SEM observations and elemental microanalyses are typically needed (Morras, 1978, 1987; Stoops, 1983; Karkanas et al., 1999; Simpson et al., 2000; Schaefer et al., 2004; Thiry et al., 2006; Simas et al., 2007) (see also Section 2.2). Amorphous and cryptocrystalline phosphate pedofeatures often exhibit features like a fine-banded, concentric or wavy internal fabric (Fig. 10) and mammillated boundaries (Figs. 7 and 9). Similar expressions are embodied by crandellite and leucophosphite spherulites (Fig. 3), radial aggregates of acicular montgomeryite (Fig. 4) and other non-equilibrium forms produced by rapid precipitation.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/77459d86-2b97-4806-917b-a922ff32f88d/43845b421e7cb8c009094de4ff7208a0643790763f6952c43f0efff61f023ff4.jpg)  
FIGURE 10 Orange cryptocrystalline crandellite nodule in a sample from Theopetra cave (Greece) (PPL). Note the convoluted wavy internal laminations (arrow).

Phosphate mineralogy can be used to infer the palaeochemical environment (Nriagu, 1976; Dill et al., 1991) and thus to assess the integrity of the archeological record and soil environment. The occurrence of Al-rich phosphates implies an acidic environment in which apatite was not stable. Under these conditions, bone apatite should have been dissolved (e.g., Berna et al., 2004), whereas other materials of interest, such as phytoliths and chert, are stable. This strategy would make possible to distinguish between environments where some of the primary constituents are absent because they were never incorporated in the archeological and soil record, as opposed to being absent or partially altered because they were subject to diagenesis (Weiner et al., 1993, 2002; Karkanas et al., 2000; Karkanas, 2010).

Excrement pedofeatures, such as carnivore coprolites, are often recognised in thin sections of samples from archeological sites (Horwitz & Goldberg, 1989; Fernandez Rodríguez et al., 1995; Goldberg et al., 2001; Allen et al., 2002). Hyena coprolites generally contain rounded fragments that are composed of microcrystalline apatite, with a pale yellow colour, dusty limpidity and almost undifferentiated b-fabric (Fig. 11). In many cases, partially dissolved bone fragments can be observed along with plant remains and phytoliths (see also Macphail & Goldberg, 2018). In addition, smooth voids such as vesicles, probably resulting from gastric gas, and elongated pores, presumably from decomposed hair/fur, can be observed. Finally, depending on the mineralogy of local soils, inclusions of sand- and silt-sized quartz can also be found. In archeological sites, the occurrence of carnivore coprolites is an indication that the site was temporarily abandoned and that bone assemblages as excavated may to a certain extent have non-human origins. Other types of phosphate excrement pedofeatures are reported by

Schaefer et al. (2004), who observed secondary complex Al-rich phosphates as infilling of channels, attributed to digestion of Ca phosphates by earthworms and other organisms.

Phosphate pedofeatures associated with guano occurrences include cryptocrystalline typic apatite nodules, found in insular arid soils associated with bird guano (Morras, 1978); similar features are recognised in anthropic sediments associated with animal dung and human waste (Fig. 12). Gregory and Rodgers (1989) report microlaminated crusts of microcrystalline apatite with a crescent internal fabric, associated with insular bird guano. In permafrost-affected ornithogenic soils formed by accumulation of penguin guano, nodular phosphate-rich features and phosphatised organo-mineral

aggregates are also observed (Simas et al., 2006, 2007; Schaefer et al., 2008). These granules are usually covered by coatings consisting of yellowish illuvial phosphates, which also occur as infillings of internal cracks. Leucophosphite, minyulite  $\mathrm{(KAl_2(PO_4)_2F\cdot 4H_2O)}$ , taranakite, and metavariscite have been documented in these soils, together with several amorphous phosphate compounds (Simas et al., 2006, 2007; Schaefer et al., 2008; Pereira et al., 2013). Taranakite microcrystalline surface crusts together with leucophosphite have been observed on phosphatised basalts associated with bird guano (Landis & Craw, 2003). Wilson & Bain (1976) also report leucophosphite in the form of hypocoatings (reaction rims) around phyllitic rock fragments in an ornithogenic soil profile.

In limestone and along the sides of coarse calcareous fragments, apatite is often found as yellowish hypocoatings (reaction rims) (Fig. 13). Their presence in limestone and karstic terrains is a good indicator of guano-related phosphate enrichment in active and eroded cave environments, where phosphate-rich solutions derived from the decay of organic matter react with the calcareous host material. On the other hand, in settings with calcareous materials, irregular yellowish nodules with undifferentiated b-fabric and low to moderate relief, enclosed by calcite accumulations, are indications of calcite replacing apatite (Fig. 14). Such features indicate a reversal of the geochemical environment and may be related to changes to a more humid climate favouring massive calcite precipitation in the form of speleothems, or to local hydrological changes enhancing flow of calcium-saturated waters, or to past human activities that interrupted the accumulation of guano.

Additional phosphatic pedofeatures in cave environments include taranakite occurrences in the form of typic nodules and incomplete infillings of platy and lenticular voids, formed in sediments affected by freeze-thaw activity (Karkanas, 2001). These occurrences are brownish and cryptocrystalline and characterised by shrinkage planar and curved voids (Figs. 7 and 15). A Ca-Fe phosphate phase approaching that of

It was found in the form of orange-brown coatings and infillings of voids, where it formed by translocation of phosphate colloids derived from the dissolution of bone apatite.

FIGURE 16 Vivianite nodule (arrow) with blue and brown colours within a yellow cryptocrystalline Fe-Ca phosphate groundmass in a sample from night soil deposits (Medieval St Julien, Tours, France) (PPL). Image by R. Macphail.

coatings of reddish yellow or colourless variscite or strengite have been also observed. In most cases, rhythmic precipitation is evident (Karkanas, unpublished data).

In water-logged sediments, iron-rich phosphates such as vivianite are found. These occurrences can be related to the presence of human waste (Fig. 16), animal waste and phosphate-rich iron slugs, and they are usually associated with crusts of manganese and iron (Bertran & Raynal, 1991; Gebhardt & Langohr, 1999; McGowan & Prangnell, 2006; Dill & Techmer, 2009). Vivianite is also found in lacustrine sediments, in the form of crystalline and alteromorphic nodules (Stamatakis & Koukouzas, 2001; Fogel et al., 2005; Sapota et al., 2006) or as layers (Lücke & Brauer, 2004). In addition, vivianite is frequently reported for bog ores (Fig. 17) (Stoops, 1983; Landuydt, 1990; Stoops & Delvigne, 1990; Kaczorek & Sommer, 2003; Gamzikov & Marmulev, 2007). It occurs as microcrystalline and coarser void infillings in former root channels and in decaying plant remains, as radial aggregates and nodules, as single crystals and in combination with siderite and iron oxides. Vivianite is predominant in the reduced zone of the lower horizons of bog ores, but its occurrence in compound coatings in the oxidised parts suggests temporary changes of redox potential, probably due to temporary higher water table levels (Stoops, 1983; Landuydt, 1990). Another relevant example is the formation of vivianite in lateritic iron crusts submitted to hydromorphic conditions (Lemos et al., 2007). It forms infillings and isolated crystals, and it replaces concentric iron nodules. The formation of vivianite is generally attributed to the activity of reducing bacteria (Dong et al., 2000; Lemos et al., 2007). Vivianite mineralisation has also been reported for water-logged ferricretes, in which it is associated with siderite or strengite. Cappings and crystal intergrowths, the latter consisting of acicular or plate-shaped crystals, are some of the forms that are found

in these environments. The origin of vivianite in ferricretes is attributed to parent material composition and to weathering of phosphate-rich iron slags (Dill & Techmer, 2009). Vivianite is easily identified in the field and in thin sections by its blue oxidation products (Fig. 17A). Weathering also transforms it to an optically isotropic, yellowish substance (Stoops & Delvigne 1990) (Fig. 17A and B) that in some cases seems to be santabarbaraite  $(\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}_{3}(\mathrm{PO}_{4})_{2}(\mathrm{OH})_{3}\cdot 5\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O})$  (Pratesi et al., 2003). In addition, vivianite can react with Ca-rich groundwater in conditions of increasing pH and Eh to produce mitridatite usually in the form of infillings (Stamatakis & Koukouzas, 2001).

Below lateritic profiles formed in argilophosphatic sediments, a second stage of alteration follows the development of the phosphate groundmass described above (Section 2.1). Laminated or compound layered coatings of cryptocrystalline Al-Ca phosphates, kaolinite and goethite are observed in voids (Flicoteaux & Lucas, 1984; Nahon, 1991). Macroscopic banded and pseudobrecciated structures resulting from pedological differentiation have been reported in the same soil environments. In thin sections, these structures have the form of nodular compound pedofeatures containing crystalline phosphate fragments (Nahon, 1991). Parron and Nahon (1980) have also reported the formation of alteromorphic nodules of crandellite after original apatite nodules in lateritic weathering of glauconitic quartzites. In weathered carbonaceous schists, crandellite and wavellite occur as layered coatings surrounding chert fragments, whereas variscite forms nodules within bedrock fractures (Dill et al., 1991). Most of the above features occur close to the soil surface and probably result from superficial weathering in conditions with non-permanent groundwater and with a drier climate than during the formation of the phosphate groundmass (Flicoteaux & Lucas, 1984; Dill et al., 1991; Dill, 2001).

In other environments, non-stochiometric apatite infillings have been reported in samples from a solodised Solonetz (Morras, 1987). Ca-Fe phosphate coatings and

infillings in an anthropic sediment have been interpreted as the result of fish bone decomposition and recrystallisation, based on micromorphological and instrumental microchemical analyses (Simpson et al., 2000). Additional crystal textural studies using microfocus synchrotron X-ray scattering has confirmed that these materials are of fish bone origin (Adderley et al., 2004). Groundwater cementation at a site with archeological deposits resulted in the development of juxtaposed convolute laminated (hypo)coatings and fillings of microcrystalline apatite (Thiry et al., 2006) and other phosphate minerals, observed in voids and around grains.

# 4. Conclusions

The identification of phosphate minerals under the microscope is not an easy task, mainly because they are mostly present in cryptocrystalline form, both as pedofeatures and as groundmass components. However, phosphates are typically autofluorescent in blue light and this can be a useful tool for their identification. SEM studies provide additional information on their submicroscopic structure, but their specific mineralogy can only be determined by instrumental mineralogical analysis.

Most of the information regarding the microscopy of phosphates comes from altered phosphorites and phosphate-rich laterites, cave environments and unique soil environments such as bog ores and ornithogenic soils. In most cases apatite is the common phosphate mineral, which with advancing diagenesis and decreasing pH is replaced first by Ca-Al phosphates and then by Al phosphates. In decalcified clay-rich sediments and soils, Al phosphates are formed directly. The development of a relatively coarse-crystalline phosphate groundmass is favoured by permanent groundwater, whereas more fine-grained features are formed by superficial alteration processes. Fe phosphates, such as vivianite and its alteration products, are particularly valuable to monitor redox changes in waterlogged sediments and soils.

The micromorphology of phosphates in normal soil environments is not well known, mainly because they constitute a minor, almost undetected, component. Most of the features seem to be derived from anthropogenic and biogenic inputs. Future studies should focus on this poorly known soil environments providing a more complete picture of the micromorphology of phosphates.

# 1. Introduction

Sulphidic sediments commonly occur in environments with reducing conditions, decaying organic matter and sufficient availability of iron and sulphur. These conditions are met in a wide range of coastal lowlands. They can also develop in certain continental

environments, where sulphide-bearing geological formations or mining-related materials are exposed to weathering.

The development of aerobic conditions, typically following natural emergence or artificial drainage, leads to oxidation of the sulphides. This results in acidification unless sufficient carbonate minerals are present to neutralise the sulphuric acid that is produced. In this manner, acid sulphate soils (cat clays) are formed, derived from sulphidic potential acid sulphate soils. As a result of widespread land reclamation in coastal lowlands, these types of soils occupy a considerable area of important agricultural regions worldwide, especially in the tropics. The high acidity and associated release of toxic metals, particularly aluminium, leads to serious problems in their agricultural use and management. Acid weathering in soils and other near-surface formations can also result in infrastructure damage, off-site surface water pollution and ecosystem deterioration.

In the World Reference Base for Soil Resources, sulphidic materials and thionic horizons are recognised, with acid sulphate soils appearing in several soil groups, classified with Thionic as suffix qualifier (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015). In Soil Taxonomy, the equivalent concepts are sulphidic materials and sulphuric horizons, and the soils mainly fit the requirements of Sulfaquents (potential acid sulphate soils) and Sulfaquepts (acid sulphate soils) (Soil Survey Staff, 1999, 2014).

# 2. Sulphidic Materials

It is commonly accepted that the following conditions are needed for pyrite formation in soils and sediments: (i) a source of iron (e.g., iron oxides, iron compounds absorbed at the surface of clay minerals); (ii) a source of sulphate ions (e.g., brackish or saline water); (iii) reducing conditions; (iv) the presence of sulphate-reducing bacteria; and (v) a source of energy for bacterial activity (organic matter). These requirements all contribute to various micromorphological characteristics of sulphidic materials. Pyrite either forms from solution or from amorphous or crystalline precursors, but no micromorphological evidence seems to be available for this issue.

Based on thin section observations, Pons (1964) distinguished three types of pyrite occurrences in acid sulphate soils: (i) primary pyrite, occurring as particles scattered in marine sediments without vegetation; (ii) secondary pyrite, formed in sediments with a vegetation cover before soil development, with pyrite associated with plant remains; and (iii) tertiary pyrite, formed when soils are inundated by brackish water rich in sulphate. The morphologies of secondary and tertiary pyrite are similar, and destruction of pyrite-hosting plant remains or pedoturbation can result in a dispersion of pyrite that renders a distinction between the three types impossible (Pons, 1964). Overall, the terminology and use of this classification are problematic. Van Dam and Pons (1973) propose a more genetically neutral classification, distinguishing pyrite occurrences (i) within the groundmass, (ii) associated with organic material, (iii) in pores, and (iv) as infillings of diatom or foraminifer remains.

# 2.1 Pyrite

Pyrite  $(\mathrm{FeS}_2)$  is by far the most common sulphide mineral in unconsolidated sediments and sulphidic soil materials. In thin sections, pyrite is opaque (Fig. 1A), with a characteristic brass-like metallic lustre in oblique incident light (OIL) (Fig. 1B). Associated organic material is often also opaque, but it shows a dark brown colour and/or a cellular fabric where the section is thinner and it remains black in OIL (Fig. 1B). In polished thin sections or blocks, studied with reflected light, pyrite is characterised by a strong light-yellow reflectance, using microscopic methods for sulphide mineral identification in ore deposits (e.g., Craig & Vaughan, 1995). In SEM studies, pyrite crystals always have an equant shape, with cubic, octahedral or dodecahedral habits (see below). In backscattered electron mode (BSE), they appear as bright particles, because of the high effective atomic number (e.g., Rabenhorst & Fanning, 1989). SEM imaging of uncovered thin sections shows a lower density of small pyrite crystals than thin section observations with transmitted or reflected light, because crystals below the surface of the specimen are not revealed (e.g., Rabenhorst & Haering, 1990; Bush & Sullivan, 1997a).

# 2.1.1 Pyrite Framboids

In soils and recent sediments, pyrite occurs mainly as framboids and much less commonly as isolated crystals. Framboids are more or less round aggregates of small crystals, which are typically well sorted (Fig. 2A and B). They are illustrated in many published reports dealing with soil-related occurrences, mainly by SEM images of undisturbed samples (Miedema et al., 1974; Arora et al., 1978; Moermann & Eswaran, 1978; Paramananthan et al., 1978; Pugh et al., 1981; Dent, 1986; Wada & Seisuwan, 1988; Rabenhorst & Fanning, 1989; Rabenhorst & Haering, 1990; Rabenhorst, 1990; Willett et al., 1992; Bush & Sullivan, 1997a, 1999; Fanning et al., 2002; Osterrieth et al., 2016). Framboids are also observed in thin sections, using incident light (van Dam & Pons, 1973; Eswaran & Joseph, 1974; Bullock et al., 1985; Dent, 1986; Stoops, 2003), transmitted

light (Rabenhorst & Haering, 1990; Rabenhorst, 1990; Rabenhorst & James, 1992) or BSE imaging (Rabenhorst & Haering, 1990; Fitzpatrick et al., 1992, 1993, 1996, 2008a; Poch et al., 2004, 2009). The size of framboids ranges from about 5 to  $50\mu \mathrm{m}$  and can vary considerably within a horizon (Arora et al., 1978). The size of individual crystals within framboids ranges from about 0.5 to  $8\mu \mathrm{m}$ . The ratio of crystal size to framboid diameter shows a considerable range (e.g., 1:6 to 1:40; Bush & Sullivan, 1999).

Pyrite crystals within the framboids are nearly exclusively octahedral (bipyramidal) (e.g., Eswaran & Joseph, 1974; Miedema et al., 1974; Rabenhorst & Haering, 1990; Bush & Sullivan, 1999; Fanning et al., 2002; Bush et al., 2004) (Fig. 2C). Several published SEM images show crystals with a combination of octahedral and hexahedral (cubic) forms (Arora et al., 1978; Pugh et al., 1981; Postma, 1982; Dent, 1986; Willett et al., 1992). Pentagonal dodecahedral (pyritohedral) crystals, which are common in geological formations, are sometimes mentioned for soils and recent sediments (Eswaran & Joseph, 1974; Rabenhorst & Fanning, 1989; Bush & Sullivan, 1997b, 1999; Dharmasri et al., 2004; Skwarnecki & Fitzpatrick, 2008), but no convincing illustrations seem to have been published. In some cases, these accounts might refer to combinations of the octahedral and hexahedral forms. Cubic forms, another common habit of pyrite in geological materials, are only rarely mentioned for framboids (Bush & Sullivan, 1999). In field experiments, promoting fast growth of pyrite framboids, crystal shapes that are less well developed than in natural settings are produced (Rabenhorst, 1990).

The organisation of the crystals in framboids is generally random, although regular patterns have been documented for non-soil-related materials (e.g., Rickard, 1970). Loose packing results in framboids with a rough surface, whereas tighter packing produces a smooth surface (Bush & Sullivan, 1999). Surface roughness can also be related to crystal habit, whereby framboids composed of octahedral crystals have a greater surface roughness than those composed of dodecahedral or rounded crystals (Bush & Sullivan, 1997a, 1999). Crystals that protrude from the framboids could represent continued growth of the aggregate by addition of crystals along the surface (Wada & Seisuwan, 1988).

Pyrite framboids occur both within the groundmass and in association with plant remains, commonly within the same horizon (e.g., Eswaran & Joseph, 1974; Moermann & Eswaran, 1978; Paramananthan et al., 1978; Willett et al., 1992; Bush & Sullivan, 1999). The framboids can be clustered (e.g., Eswaran & Joseph, 1974; Miedema et al., 1974; Poch et al., 2004, 2009) (see Fig. 2B), although this grouping is susceptible to being destroyed by pedoturbation in the upper part of the soil profile (Eswaran & Joseph, 1974). Occasionally, these clusters form coherent aggregates, termed 'polyframboids' (e.g., Arora et al., 1978; Dixon et al., 1982; Postma, 1982). Clustered framboids with interstitial amorphous iron sulphides in pores were described by Kooistra (1978, 1981).

The nature and formation of framboids is discussed in various papers dealing with settings that are largely unrelated to soil environments, whose review is beyond the scope of this chapter. With regard to the genesis of framboids, processes suggested in these papers include pseudomorphism after organic aggregates (e.g., Kalliokoski & Cathles, 1969; Rickard, 1970), development as infillings of spherical voids (Rickard, 1970), replacement of a greigite  $(\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}_{2}\mathrm{S}_{4})$  or iron monosulphide precursor (e.g., Sweeney & Kaplan, 1973; Sawlowicz, 1993; Wilkin & Barnes, 1997), and transformation of sulphur aggregates (Kribek, 1975). In a soil-related on-site experiment, framboids formed only in macropores, not in the clayey groundmass, which is explained by the greater availability of free sulphides, the more aerobic conditions compared with those

within the groundmass, and the possibility of growth in non-restricting open space (Rabenhorst, 1990). Similarly, Wada and Seisuwan (1988) suggest that framboids only form at levels where oxygen-bearing waters can penetrate. Pyriteframboid morphology may be an indicator of redox conditions (Wilkin et al., 1996), but this is not confirmed by a study of pyrite in salt marsh sediments (Roychoudhury et al., 2003). Prakongkep et al. (2012) describe an occurrence of sulphur aggregates as possible precursors of pyrite framboids.

Framboids can be coated with a thin film of organic material (e.g., Miedema et al., 1974; Wada & Seisuwan, 1988; Willett et al., 1992; Bush & Sullivan, 1997a, 1999), possibly derived from fungi (Bush & Sullivan, 1997a, 1999). Coatings composed of a mixture of clay and organic material have been recognised for macropores without root remains (Bush & Sullivan, 1997a, 1999). Both types of coatings probably retard the rate of oxidation (Bush & Sullivan, 1997a, 1999). As fine-grained aggregates, framboids are anyway more susceptible to fast oxidation than single crystals of a similar size (e.g., Pugh et al., 1981). Framboids in roots, discussed further in Section 2.3, can have a coating of iron monosulphides, which could increase the rate of oxidation (Bush & Sullivan, 1997a, 1999). Another type of degradation of framboids is dispersion of the constituent crystals, as a result of sediment transport (van Dam & Pons, 1973), wave action (Fitzpatrick et al., 1993, 2008a) or bioturbation (Fitzpatrick et al., 2008a). Coherence of undisturbed framboids may require cementation by iron sulphides (Arora et al., 1978).

# 2.1.2 Other Aspects of Pyrite Occurrences

Pyrite in soils and recent sediments partly occur as isolated crystals in the groundmass (Eswaran, 1967; Slager et al., 1970; van Dam & Pons, 1973; Eswaran & Joseph, 1974; Miedema et al., 1974; Fanning & Rabenhorst, 1990; Willett et al., 1992; Bush & Sullivan, 1997a, 1999). The shape of these isolated crystals has been described as spherical (Slager et al., 1970), cubic (Eswaran & Joseph, 1974) and octahedral (e.g., Miedema et al., 1974). The octahedral form is occasionally combined with small faces of the hexahedral form (van Breemen, 1976; Rabenhorst & Fanning, 1989; Shamshuddin et al., 2004; Burton et al., 2006; López-Buendía et al., 2007). In some profiles, isolated crystals in the groundmass are more common in deeper parts than at other depths (Pons, 1970; Eswaran & Joseph, 1974). This type of pyrite has been considered to be synsedimentary (van Dam & Pons, 1973; Eswaran & Joseph, 1974). Isolated pyrite crystals can also be derived from occurrences associated with plant remains, following the decomposition of organic material (Wada & Seisuwan, 1988). In other studies, the occurrence of isolated crystals rather than framboids has been related to relatively fast pyrite formation (e.g., Luther et al., 1982).

Another type of non-framboidal pyrite is represented by clusters of crystals associated with plant remains, with a greater crystal size than pyrite in framboids (Paramananthan et al., 1978; Willett et al., 1992; Roychoudhury et al., 2003). Bush and Sullivan (1997a, 1999) also mention non-framboidal clusters in the groundmass and

pyrite occurrences as coatings or infillings of macropores. Infillings of pores without associated organic material have been interpreted as synsedimentary precipitates (van Dam & Pons, 1973). However, infillings of this type can also develop later as diagenetic features (Rabenhorst, 1990), unrelated to the presence of organic material (Rabenhorst & James, 1992).

Associations between pyrite and plant remains, particularly roots, have commonly been reported. The pyrite crystals or framboids sometimes occupy the central hollow of the remains of roots or reeds (Slager et al., 1970; Miedema et al., 1974; Dent, 1986; Rabenhorst & Haering, 1990; Rabenhorst & James, 1992; FitzPatrick, 1993). They can also form within the cells of the plant remains (van Dam & Pons, 1973; Paramananthan et al., 1978; Eswaran & Shoba, 1983; Wada & Seisuwan, 1988), where the growth of pyrite can disrupt the tissue structure (van Dam & Pons, 1973). Pyrite occurrences in cells can be connected by filaments composed of pyrite, suggesting a relationship with fungal hyphae (Wada & Seisuwan, 1988). In some cases, pyrite occurs in larger voids within plant remains (Bouma et al., 1990; Fitzpatrick et al., 1993). Associations between organic material and pyrite without a restriction to specific parts of the plant remains have also been illustrated (Rabenhorst & Haering, 1990; Rabenhorst & James, 1992). A related feature is pyrite pseudomorphs after organic material (Kooistra, 1978), which is a fairly common diagenetic feature in the geological record. Wada and Seisuwan (1988) observed that the amount of pyrite associated with plant remains increases with increasing degree of decomposition, suggesting a relationship between decomposition and pyrite formation, but exceptions to this general rule indicate that both processes are not completely interdependent.

Eswaran (1967) observed the development of pyrite hypocoatings around plant remains in an initial stage, followed by impregnation of the remains and subsequently by decomposition of all organic matter, leaving pyrite occurrences as coatings or infillings of channels. Rabenhorst and Haering (1990) observed a preferential occurrence of pyrite in root channels and vugs within a mineral horizon, explained by a genetic relationship between pyrite formation and the presence of organic material, rather than by the slow diffusion of sulphates into the groundmass that would also explain the observed pyrite distribution pattern. In the overlying organic layer of the same soil profile, pyrite is closely associated with plant fragments but randomly distributed. Other examples of pyrite occurrences in organic layers have been described for continental environments (Stoops, 1983; Jakobsen, 1988; Gudmundsson & FitzPatrick, 2004). The presence of pyrite inside shells (van Dam & Pons, 1973; Miedema et al., 1974; Fanning & Rabenhorst, 1990; Bush & Sullivan, 1997a, 1999) has also been related to the decay of organic matter derived from the dying organism (Fanning & Rabenhorst, 1990).

Pyrite occurrences in palaeosols (e.g., Moermann & Eswaran, 1978; McSweeney & Fastovsky, 1987; Stoops, 1992; Joeckel, 1995; Wright et al., 1997) do not necessarily represent buried sulphidic soil materials, as their formation can be related to mineralisation during flooding or at a later stage.

# 2.2 Sulphides Other Than Pyrite

Marcasite  $(\mathrm{FeS}_2)$  is opaque in transmitted light and has an appearance similar to that of pyrite in OIL. In reflected light microscopy, the strong anisotropy of marcasite can allow a distinction with pyrite. In a rare study of marcasite in recent sediments, a platy crystal habit has been observed (Bush et al., 2004). In this study, the marcasite crystals are observed to cover the surface of pyrite framboids associated with organic material, and a marcasite-pyrite association is considered to be a proxy for freshwater to brackish depositional swamp environments. Pugh et al. (1981) illustrate spherical marcasite aggregates, with platy crystals (see Dixon et al., 1982), in lignite overburden, which represents an atypical setting.

Greigite  $(\mathrm{Fe}^{2 + }\mathrm{Fe}^{3 + }_{2}\mathrm{S}_{4})$  is unstable under ambient conditions and might require fast drying for its detection in micromorphological studies (Bush & Sullivan, 1997a, 1997b). It occurs as tabular to platy crystals (Bush & Sullivan, 1997a, 1997b; Burton et al., 2011), but subhedral cubic forms have also been reported for a possible greigite occurrence (Skwarnecki & Fitzpatrick, 2008). Burton et al. (2011) cite micromorphological evidence against a role of greigite as pyrite precursor.

Mackinawite  $(\mathrm{Fe,Ni})_{1 + x}\mathrm{S},x = 0 - 0.07)$  forms small convoluted plate-shaped crystals (Burton et al., 2006; see also Herbert et al., 1998). Unidentified iron monosulphides were described by Rabenhorst (1990), as hypocoatings surrounding iron-rich soil fragments placed in tidal marsh sediments. These features were only observed in thin sections stored in anaerobic conditions and are rapidly oxidised in contact with air. Boman et al. (2008) illustrate iron monosulphide occurrences with a composition that is intermediate between that of mackinawite and greigite.

Amorphous iron sulphides with variable iron/sulphur ratios have also been reported, apparently confined to the upper part of pyrite-bearing intervals (Kooistra, 1981). The former presence of iron sulphides that are more reactive than pyrite has been suggested for jarosite-bearing materials containing unaltered pyrite framboids (Plumlee et al., 2016). In potential acid sulphate soil areas where the geological substrate is characterised by base metal mineralisation, sulphides such as chalcopyrite  $(\mathrm{CuFeS}_2)$ , galena (PbS) and sphalerite (ZnS) can form as authigenic precipitates (Skwarnecki & Fitzpatrick, 2008).

# 2.3 General Fabric of Sulphidic Layers

Little attention has been given in the literature to the general fabric characteristics of sulphidic layers. These features are partly unrelated to the sulphidic nature of the soil, but their characterisation can contribute to understanding soil development.

Mineral horizons with sulphidic materials are generally apedal, with a channel or vugh microstructure (Rabenhorst & Haering, 1990), compatible with a lack of soil structure development in a permanently wet environment. Planar voids do occur in the upper part of acid sulphate soils (Miedema et al., 1974). Changes in submicroscopic structure during drainage of tidal soils, particularly the collapse of micropores, have been illustrated by Tovey and Dent (2002). Organic layers in sulphidic soils typically have

a high porosity, as deposits composed of a mixture of intact organ residues and amorphous fine organic material (Rabenhorst & Haering, 1990).

The groundmass commonly has a porphyric c/f-related distribution pattern, typical of poorly aerated soils. The composition of the coarse fraction is a reflection of the marine or alluvial origin of the sediments, which include components such as glauconite (Miedema et al., 1974) and diatom remains (e.g., Paramananthan et al., 1978). The occurrence of layering (e.g., Miedema et al., 1974) or a parallel orientation of plant remains (Wada & Seisuwan, 1988) is also compatible with a sedimentary origin. Organ and tissue residues are common constituents of the groundmass, and fresh or decayed roots can be abundant. The micromass can show speckled or striated b-fabrics (Paramananthan et al., 1978), unless masking by fine organic matter results in an undifferentiated b-fabric. The recognition of striated b-fabrics is in agreement with SEM observations of zones with oriented clay along roots and microped faces in dewatered tidal soils (Tovey & Dent, 2002). Unistrial b-fabrics are typical of undisturbed sediments in the lower horizons of soil profiles (Spaargaren et al., 1981). The absence of preferred orientations in dredged sulphidic materials has been related to a high degree of clay dispersion (Fanning & Rabenhorst, 1990).

# 3. Sulphuric Materials

Oxidation of pyrite results in the release of  $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ ,  $\mathrm{SO}_4^{2-}$  and  $\mathrm{H}^+$  ions. If no buffering occurs, most commonly by a reaction with carbonate minerals, conditions with low pH will develop. This strong acidity leads to alteration of other soil constituents such as clay minerals, resulting in the liberation of additional ion species. These reactions can ultimately result in the formation of various authigenic minerals, whose micromorphological features are discussed below.

Oxidation of sulphides first occurs along pores, resulting in preferential alteration of pyrite along ped faces (Bronswijk & Groenenberg, 1988) and determining the distribution of secondary minerals (e.g., Fanning & Rabenhorst, 1990). The preferential occurrence of pyrite along pores is another factor that determines these patterns (e.g., Bush & Sullivan, 1999). In some studies, only dissolution of pyrite is observed, without associated mineral formation (Eswaran, 1967). Corrosion of remaining pyrite crystals is recognised by the presence of pervasively pitted crystal faces (e.g., Shamshuddin et al., 2004, 2014). The groundmass around weathered pyrite occurrences can be affected as well, resulting in alteration of clay particles and contributing to the development of circumgranular voids around framboids embedded within a clay groundmass (Willett et al., 1992).

# 3.1 Jarosite

In thin sections, jarosite  $\mathrm{(KFe^{3 + }_{3}(SO_{4})_{2}(OH)_{6})}$  is yellowish in plane-polarised light and orange brown in cross-polarised light (e.g., van Dam & Pons, 1973; Eswaran & Joseph, 1974). Fine-grained jarosite aggregates can be dark, but such occurrences

can be recognised by a yellowish to greenish colour in reflected light (Dent, 1986; FitzPatrick, 1993).

In SEM images, jarosite crystals are typically equant, with a pseudocubic habit of euhedral crystals (e.g., Cheverry et al., 1972; van Breemen & Harmsen, 1975; van Breemen, 1976; Wagner et al., 1982; Eswaran & Shoba, 1983; Shamshuddin et al., 1986; Shamshuddin & Auxtero, 1991), which in TEM images is compatible with square forms (Shamshuddin & Auxtero, 1991; Simas et al., 2006) and hexagonal shapes (Prakongkep et al., 2012). The pseudocubic shape has led some authors to suggest pseudomorphism after pyrite crystals (Carson et al., 1982; Carson & Dixon, 1983; Doner & Lynn, 1989). This is partly based on the recognition of octahedral forms for jarosite crystals (Carson et al., 1982; Carson & Dixon, 1983), although the presence of triangular crystal faces is compatible with the development of the  $\{0001\}$  form in combination with the rhombohedral  $\{0112\}$  form (see e.g., Gasharova et al., 2005). Aberrant jarosite crystal morphologies are represented by tabular (Eswaran & Joseph, 1974), elongated (Paramananthan et al., 1978) and plate-shaped crystals (Shamshuddin et al., 2004, 2014; Plumlee et al., 2016).

Jarosite in acid sulphate soils occurs as infillings (Slager et al., 1970; van Dam & Pons, 1973; Eswaran & Joseph, 1974; Moormann & Eswaran, 1978; FitzPatrick, 1993), as coatings (Dent, 1986; Fanning & Rabenhorst, 1990; Poch et al., 2004), and as hypo- or quasicoatings (Slager et al., 1970; van Dam & Pons, 1973; Miedema et al., 1974; Spaargaren et al., 1981; Bouma et al., 1990; Poch et al., 2004, 2009) (Fig. 3A).

When the transition from reduced to oxidising conditions is fast, as it can be along pores, jarosite will form near the pyrite from which most of its constituents are derived during oxidation (van Dam & Pons, 1973). This can result in development of occurrences that are pseudomorphic after pyrite aggregates, which may have some remaining pyrite

in their centres (Miedema et al., 1974; Bouma et al., 1990). Local transformation of pyrite has also been suggested for dense complete jarosite infillings of channels (FitzPatrick, 1993). Other possible results of local processes are the development of a honeycomb structure, apparently by jarosite formation around the constituent crystals of pyrite framboids (Wallace et al., 2005), and the development of thin jarosite coatings around pyrite framboids (Shand et al., 2016).

When oxidation of sulphidic materials is slower, ions released by pyrite alteration are able to migrate toward ped faces, where jarosite infillings, coatings or hypocoatings will ultimately develop (van Dam & Pons, 1973; Miedema et al., 1974), possibly with an intermediate stage of iron oxide formation (Miedema et al., 1974).

Once jarosite has formed, it can be affected by dissolution, as suggested for fine-grained hypidiotopic aggregates in intertidal settings (Keene et al., 2010; Johnston et al., 2011), which might also apply to floodplain occurrences (Fall et al., 2014). A more commonly reported type of jarosite alteration is transformation to iron oxides through interaction with percolating water (van Dam & Pons, 1973; Eswaran & Joseph, 1974; Miedema et al., 1974; Dent, 1986; Fanning & Rabenhorst, 1990). This process can produce iron oxide features that are pseudomorphic after jarosite aggregates (Miedema et al., 1974). More commonly, jarosite coatings/hypocoatings (Miedema et al., 1974; Dent, 1986; Fanning & Rabenhorst, 1990) or infillings (van Dam & Pons, 1973) are only partly transformed to iron oxides, along the sides of the pores. The alteration of jarosite hypocoatings can result in development of iron oxide hypocoatings or of associated iron oxide hypocoatings and jarosite quasicoatings (Miedema et al., 1974) (Fig. 3B). Complete transformation of a jarosite hypocoating, followed by partial leaching, has been suggested for pores with iron oxide quasicoatings (Dent, 1986). An association between jarosite and derived iron oxides is also observed at the submicroscopic scale (Simas et al., 2006).

In addition to susceptibility to chemical alteration, jarosite (and iron oxide) hypocoatings can become separated from ped faces, because of a difference in shrink-swell behaviour relative to the non-cemented ped interiors (Fanning & Rabenhorst, 1990). This can result in development of infillings composed of fragments of jarosite hypocoatings, together with sand grains and plant fragments (Miedema et al., 1974). Iluviation has also been invoked for the development of layered jarosite coatings (Fanning & Rabenhorst, 1990), implying transportation of jarosite as individual grains or small aggregates. Another type of translocation is mechanical disturbance by ploughing, resulting in the presence of nodules composed of jarosite and iron oxides in the Ap horizon, derived from coatings and hypocoatings in the B horizon (Spaargaren et al., 1981).

Varying conditions during and after the formation of jarosite result in complex patterns for compound pedofeatures, composed of jarosite, iron oxides, groundmass material and organic matter (Slager et al., 1970; Miedema et al., 1974; Fanning & Rabenhorst, 1990).

Jarosite in palaeosols occurs as infillings of channels (Buurman, 1975; PiPujol & Buurman, 1994) and other pores (Moormann & Eswaran, 1978). Other examples are

jarosite-dominated rhizoliths (McSweeney & Fastovsky, 1987; Kraus & Hasiotis, 2006), round aggregates associated with organic material in pores (Kraus, 1998), and impregnative features around channels (Kraus, 1998). These occurrences are mainly interpreted as an indication that the soils were pyrite-bearing, whereby jarosite formed following exposure of the deposits at a much later stage, unrelated to the period of palaeosol development (Buurman, 1975; PiPujol & Buurman, 1994; Kraus, 1998; Kraus & Hasiotis, 2006).

# 3.2 Iron Oxides

Similar to patterns of jarosite formation, the distribution of iron oxides is partly determined by the speed of establishment of oxidising conditions, with iron oxide precipitation near pyrite occurrences when oxidation is fast and iron oxide hypo- or quasicoating development along pores when oxidation is slower (van Dam & Pons, 1973; Miedema et al., 1974). In this way, fast oxidation can result in pseudomorphism after pyrite aggregates (Slager et al., 1970; Miedema et al., 1974) (see also Tovey, 1986; Wierzchos et al., 1995).

Iron oxides in acid sulphate soils occur in the form of nodules (Slager et al., 1970; Paramananthan et al., 1978), coatings (Slager et al., 1970; Miedema et al., 1974), and hypo- or quasicoatings (Slager et al., 1970; van Dam & Pons, 1973; Paramananthan et al., 1978; Spaargaren et al., 1981) (Fig. 4). Occurrences of iron oxides in pores are partly associated with plant remains (Eswaran & Joseph, 1974; Miedema et al., 1974). Slager et al. (1970) mention an increase in the amount of nodules relative to the amount of hypo- and quasicoatings with decreasing depth, as well as a greater abundance and sharpness of the nodules in older soils, suggesting that the nodules are derived from fragmented hypocoatings. Nodules can also form by impregnation of the groundmass,

possibly confined to parts with a low degree of compaction (Paramananthan et al., 1978). A uniform size distribution suggests continuous growth without initiation of the development of additional nodules (Paramananthan et al., 1978).

The amorphous iron oxides that are initially formed can at a later stage be transformed to goethite or hematite by dehydration (Slager et al., 1970; van Dam & Pons, 1973; Miedema et al., 1974). This alteration is recognised by a change in colour (Slager et al., 1970) or by the appearance of relatively coarse-crystalline iron oxides (van Dam & Pons, 1973; Miedema et al., 1974). Hematite coatings illustrated by Spaargaren et al. (1981) seem to occur along the sides of pores with (amorphous) iron oxide quasicoatings. Well-developed crystalline iron oxides and amorphous iron compounds occurring at the same site are also described by Eswaran and Joseph (1974), without commenting on a possible relationship between both phases. Another possible type of iron compound in acid sulphate soils are complexes of iron and organic matter, described to occur as hypocoatings and as coatings with cracked surfaces (Paramananthan et al., 1978). Microscopic features of akaganeite  $(\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}, \mathrm{Ni}^{2+})_{8}(\mathrm{OH}, \mathrm{O})_{16} \mathrm{Cl}_{1.25} \cdot n \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O})$ , originally described as an Fe oxide, have also been documented for acid sulphate soils (Bibi et al., 2011).

# 3.3 Gypsum

Gypsum crystals  $(\mathrm{Ca(SO_4)}\cdot 2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O})$  in acid sulphate soils are typically elongated prismatic (Slager et al., 1970; van Dam & Pons, 1973; Stoops et al., 1978; Moormann & Eswaran, 1978; Paramananthan et al., 1978; Wagner et al., 1982; Eswaran, 1984; Eswaran & Shoba, 1983; Eswaran & Zi-Tong, 1991) (Fig. 5A). More equant prismatic forms (Miedema et al., 1974; FitzPatrick, 1984, 1993; Bullock et al., 1985) and roughly tabular crystals (Aslan &

Autin, 1996; Sukitprapanona et al., 2014) (Fig. 5B) have also been described. This difference in morphology between gypsum in acid soils and lenticular pedogenic gypsum in soils of arid regions (see Poch et al., 2010, 2018) is related to a difference in soil water chemistry whose nature is poorly understood. An effect of high aluminium concentrations in acid environments has been suggested (Moormann & Eswaran, 1978), but the absence or inactivity of habit-modifying compounds that cause the development of lenticular forms in other settings is a more likely cause. For an exceptional occurrence of predominantly lenticular gypsum in an acid sulphate soil, a stage with less acidic conditions in a calcareous soil is inferred (Poch et al., 2004, 2009).

The elongated gypsum crystals partly occur as radial or fan-like aggregates (Stoops et al., 1978; Moormann & Eswaran, 1978; Eswaran, 1984). Some clusters are closely associated with soil components that act as a source of sulphur or calcium, such as pyrite aggregates (Moormann & Eswaran, 1978) or shell fragments (Poch et al., 2004). A different interpretation of a gypsum-pyrite association is given by Tsatskin and Nadel (2003), who refer to the establishment of reducing conditions with pyrite formation, following a period with gypsum formation.

Gypsum occurrences in acid sulphate soils include infillings (Slager et al., 1970; van Dam & Pons, 1973; Miedema et al., 1974; Bouma et al., 1990; FitzPatrick, 1993) and clustered or isolated crystals in the groundmass (FitzPatrick, 1984, 1993; Ritsema & Groenenberg, 1993). Gypsum formation in pores that is restricted to the upper parts of soil profiles has been related to an interaction between jarosite and calcium-bearing water derived from the surface (van Dam & Pons, 1973). FitzPatrick (1993) illustrates gypsum associated with a jarosite infilling, both assumed to be derived from local oxidation of pore-filling pyrite.

Special features related to gypsum occurrences include granostriation around crystals (Poch et al., 2004) and infillings (van Dam & Pons, 1973), related to crystallisation pressure during displacive growth. These features are also present around moulds of lenticular crystals that remain after dissolution of the gypsum (Poch et al., 2004, 2009). Gypsum crystals incorporated in jarosite hypocoatings record that the latter formed at a later stage, when the availability of calcium was lower (Poch et al., 2004, 2009).

# 3.4 Silica

Pedofeatures composed of silica include hypo- and quasicoatings (Slager et al., 1970; van Dam & Pons, 1973) and nodules (Slager et al., 1970). Uniform impregnation of the groundmass has also been suggested, related to alteration of clay (van Dam & Pons, 1973). Buurman et al. (1973) describe silicified plant remains, characterised by the presence of thin silica coatings on cell walls (see also van Breemen, 1982). Bush and Sullivan (1997a) recognise aggregates of mixed microcrystalline silica and iron sulphides, whose formation is apparently unrelated to oxidation of pyrite. Joeckel (1995) found a close association of pyrite, authigenic silica and plant remains in hydromorphic palaeosols.

# 3.5 Other Minerals

Reports of other authigenic minerals in acid sulphate soils are rare. Montoroi (1995) illustrates features of salt efflorescences with lath-shaped halotrichite, acicular alunogen, rounded rozenite crystals and plate-shaped tamarugite and soda-alum, commenting on the relationship between type of aggregation and porosity (see Table 1 for chemical formulas). Fitzpatrick et al. (2008b, 2010) document occurrences of bladed sideronatrite  $\mathrm{(Na_2Fe^{3 + }(SO_4)_2(OH)\cdot 3H_2O)}$ , xenotopic botryogen  $\mathrm{(MgFe^{3 + }(SO_4)_2(OH)\cdot 7H_2O)}$  and needle- to lath-shaped redingtonite  $\mathrm{(Fe^{2 + }Cr_2(SO_4)_4\cdot 22H_2O)}$ , which were in part interpreted as having formed after sampling (Fitzpatrick et al., 2009). Gouleau et al. (1982) describe authigenic aluminium hydroxides, occurring as short prismatic crystals, isolated and as part of small aggregates (see also Marius, 1985), and implied amorphous deposits are described as coatings on halite (NaCl) by Fitzpatrick et al. (2008c). Micromorphological features of a pre-Quaternary example are illustrated for a Jurassic swamp deposit containing sodium-rich alunite that formed before compaction (Goldbery, 1978). Alunite is also abundant in certain Cenozoic silcretes, as cubic crystals and associated moulds of such crystals, whose present distribution is not clearly related to the swamp environment that is inferred for deposition of part of the parent material (Meyer & Pena dos Reis, 1985).

# 4. Sulphide Oxidation Products in Contexts Other Than Acid Sulphate Soils

Processes similar to those in acid sulphate soils on aerated pyrite-bearing sediments take place in various other environments where sulphide minerals are oxidised. Using studies cited in Table 1 as examples, these contexts include soils developed on sulphide-bearing shales (e.g., Mermut et al., 1985; Mermut & Arshad, 1987), exposures of sulphide-bearing rocks (e.g., Tien, 1968; Clayton, 1980; Parafiniuk, 1991; Flohr et al., 1995a; Lauf, 1997; Hammarstrom & Smith, 2002; Hammarstrom et al., 2003a, 2005a, 2005b; Bowell & Parshley, 2005; Joeckel et al., 2005, 2007, 2011; Gomes & Favas, 2006; Eskola & Peuraniemi, 2008), mining waste deposits (e.g., Harris et al., 2003; Alvarez-Valero et al., 2008; Sracek et al., 2010), soils affected by mine tailings spills (e.g., Dorronsoro et al., 2002; Simón et al., 2002), alluvial material in mining areas (e.g., Buckby et al., 2003), and banks of rivers affected by acid mine drainage (e.g., Romero et al., 2006).

In these settings, oxidation of sulphides is more commonly expressed by the presence of sulphates other than jarosite and gypsum, in comparison with typical acid sulphate soils. Below, an overview of the morphology and mode of occurrence of the various relevant sulphate minerals is given, together with a summary of published interpretations of micromorphological features. Iron oxides are not considered here. Subaqueous settings, cave environments and experimental studies are also excluded. A more directly relevant context is mineral formation during storage of sulphide-bearing samples (e.g., Wiese et al., 1987).

# 4.1 Jarosite

The morphology reported for jarosite is predominantly pseudocubic (Dixon et al., 1982; Flohr et al., 1995a, 1995b; Lin, 1997; Hochella et al., 1999; Charpentier et al., 2001; Simón et al., 2002; Sucha et al., 2002; Jamieson et al., 2005b; Kostova & Zdravkov, 2007; Park & Kim, 2016). Exceptions are hexagonal prismatic crystals (Gillott, 1980), plate-shaped crystals (Krasilnikov & Shoba, 1997; Civeira et al., 2016), acicular crystals (Boulet & Larocque, 1998; Courtin-Nomade et al., 2003), thick tabular to plate-shaped crystals (Frost et al., 2007), as well as possible combinations of forms producing triangular crystal faces (Darmody et al., 2007). Some studies have suggested a relationship between crystal size and crystallisation rates (Frost et al., 2007) and between both crystal size and morphological uniformity and water availability (Miller, 2011).

Jarosite partly forms directly on sulphides in ore deposits (e.g., Haubrich & Tichomirowa, 2002). Partial or complete pseudomorphic replacement of pyrite by jarosite has also been reported (Furbish, 1963). Nickel (1984) describes pseudomorphs after large pyrite crystals, characterised by a boxwork structure with septa composed of fine-grained jarosite that formed along cracks. These pseudomorphs also include sulphur crystals that formed at a later stage, as well as pyrite remnants. Another example of this type of replacement is jarosite aggregates that are pseudomorphic after glauconite grains (Briggs, 1951). A related feature is replacement of potassium feldspar by jarosite and kaolinite (Mascaro et al., 2001).

In alluvium derived from mining areas, euhedral jarosite crystals have been considered to be detrital, with good preservation during transport due to flow density (Bustillo et al., 2010). Alluvium in similar settings can also contain jarosite as part of detrital coarse grains (Hudson-Edwards et al., 1999). The same deposits also contain iron-bearing sulphates developed around reworked pyrite grains after deposition. Similar processes take place in waste piles, for example resulting in cross-linear alteration of pyrrhotite  $(\mathrm{Fe}_7\mathrm{S}_8)$  to jarosite and sulphur (Hammarstrom et al., 2003b). Away from the inherited sulphides, jarosite occurrences include infillings or nodules described by Strawn et al. (2002), who used micro-XRF and micro-EXAFS analyses to confirm mineral identification. Possible jarosite infillings in pyrite-bearing volcanic rock fragments are illustrated by Schaefer et al. (2008).

Occurrences in mine passages include silica-cemented jarosite aggregates (Jamieson et al., 2005b). Features with a similar macroscopic appearance but composed of jarosite and schwertmannite  $(\mathrm{Fe}^{3+})_{16}\mathrm{O}_{16}(\mathrm{OH})_{9.6}(\mathrm{SO}_4)_{3.2} \cdot 10\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O})$  have been described for an identical setting (Gammons, 2006).

Mermut et al. (1985) and Mermut and Arshad (1987) describe netrojarosite occurrences  $(\mathrm{NaFe}^{3+}_{3}(\mathrm{SO}_{4})_{2}(\mathrm{OH})_{6})$  that are very similar to those of jarosite in acid sulphate soils, for example with regard to crystal morphology, association with pores, presence of pyrite remnants and alteration to iron oxides. Gieré et al. (2003) describe a hydroniumjarosite occurrence  $(\mathrm{(H_3O)Fe}^{3+}_{3}(\mathrm{SO}_4)_2(\mathrm{OH})_6)$  whose development predates jarosite formation. These minerals partly occur as spherical hydroniumjarosite nodules and as coatings composed of small jarosite oolites. Textural evidence identifies anglesite

$\mathrm{(Pb(SO_4))}$  formation as an intermediate step (Farkas et al., 2009) in alteration of galena to plumbojarosite  $\mathrm{(Pb_{0.5}Fe^{3 + }{}_{3}(SO_{4})_{2}(OH)_{6})}$ , characterised by a roughly tabular morphology (Farkas et al., 2009).

Pronounced compositional zoning with varying K-Na-  $\mathrm{H}_3\mathrm{O}$  proportions has been interpreted to record a strong influence of variations in local conditions during crystal growth (Jamieson et al., 2005b). Papike et al. (2007) discuss similar features in terms of a miscibility gap between end-members with different solubilities, implying that phases with intermediate compositions will not form at low temperatures.

# 4.2 Gypsum

Gypsum crystals formed in acid environments are almost invariably elongated prismatic (Dixon et al., 1982; Fitzpatrick et al., 1992, 1996; Flohr et al., 1995a, 1995b; Lauf, 1997; Boulet & Larocque, 1998; Puura et al., 1999; Charpentier et al., 2001; Darmody et al., 2002; Dorronsoro et al., 2002; Simón et al., 2002; Aguilar et al., 2003; Buckby et al., 2003; Joeckel et al., 2005; Gomes & Favas, 2006; Darmody et al., 2007; Kostova & Zdravkov, 2007; Eskola & Peuraniemi, 2008). Lath- and plate-shaped crystals have also been observed (Gillott, 1980).

In some studies, occurrences of gypsum near pyrite aggregates (Charpentier et al., 2001; Kostova & Zdravkov, 2007) or limestone fragments (Puura et al., 1999) are mentioned. In soils affected by a tailings spill, gypsum crystals occur in the outer part of coatings around carbonate grains, with an inner part composed of aluminium compounds whose formation is related to an increase in pH during alteration of the grain they surround (Aguilar et al., 2003). Other aspects of gypsum occurrences are widening of planar voids by crystal growth (Gillott, 1980), rounding of crystals by partial dissolution (Joeckel et al., 2005) and development of Cu-rich reaction rims (Mees et al., 2013).

# 4.3 Other Sulphate Minerals

An overview of the morphology of common sulphate minerals in environments with sulphide oxidation, other than jarosite and gypsum, is given in Table 1. Occurrences whose mineralogical composition could not be identified precisely are not included in this table. Various less common sulphate minerals formed by sulphide alteration are illustrated by Szakáll et al. (1997).

Harris et al. (2003) mention a difference in degree of preservation between crystals of poorly soluble and highly soluble salt minerals, illustrated by subhedral osarizawaite and euhedral chalcanthite and tamarugite. Joeckel et al. (2005) recognise two size classes for plate-shape crystals, possibly related to copiapite-coquimbite transformations. An association of small and larger plate-shaped iron sulphate crystals is also recognised by Jamieson et al. (2005a), who identify the smaller crystals as aluminium-rich copiapite that formed on coarser magnesium-rich copiapite after sampling (see also Jambor et al., 2000, p. 318-319). In another study, a difference in iron content between (iron-poor) acicular copiapite and associated lozenge-shaped tabular copiapite crystals is suggested (Dill et al., 2002).

Several studies document the patterns of alteration of sulphides to secondary sulphate minerals (e.g., Jamieson et al., 1995; Boulet & Larocque, 1998; Shaw et al., 1998; Bowell & Parshley, 2005; Koski et al., 2008). SEM studies have also been used to deduce sequences of mineral formation. Paragenetic sequences recognised by Buckby et al. (2003) are copiapite-halotrichite, coquimbite-szomolnokite and rozeniterhomboclase/szomolnokite-gypsum. Hammarstrom et al. (2005a) describe copiapite formation on pyrite (see also Joeckel et al., 2007), together with rozenite, followed by the formation of halotrichite on rozenite. In the same study, dietrichite aggregates enclosing fine-grained zinc sulphates are observed, but the significance of this association is not apparent. Frost et al. (2007) interpret the absence of halotrichite in certain jarosite-bearing samples as an indication of the conversion of halotrichite to jarosite. Flohr et al. (1995b) refer to micromorphological features suggesting late-stage development of hinsdaleite and alunite, and Valente & Gomes (2009) mention aluminium sulphate deposition following melanterite formation as a result of iron depletion. Ring-shaped osarizawaite crystals have been interpreted as remnants of tabular hexagonal crystals of the alunite-jarosite group with compositional zoning (Nickel, 1980). Alteration of halotrichite to hydrated iron sulphates occurs preferentially at the ends of halotrichite bundles (Joeckel et al., 2007). Another aspect of sulphate mineral formation for which microscopic evidence has been cited is the possible role of microorganisms (e.g., Laskou et al., 2010).

A rare thin section study records the occurrence of felsobanyaite (basaluminite) in residual clays derived from limestone along the contact with pyrite-bearing shale (Milton et al., 1955).

# 5. Conclusions

Micromorphological studies of sulphidic materials and sulphuric horizons have well documented the mode of occurrence of the various authigenic minerals they contain, showing a great similarity between profiles worldwide. Micropedology has considerably contributed to understanding the main processes involved in the formation and behaviour of sulphidic and sulphuric soil materials. Further progress in understanding the development of these materials might mainly be achieved by concentrating on occurrences with aberrant mineralogical compositions or textural characteristics. For acid environments other than acid sulphate soils, the potential of micromorphology to understand paragenetic sequences is largely unexplored but bears considerable promise.

# 1. Introduction

Textural pedofeatures are characterised by a difference in grain size with the adjacent groundmass and comprise coatings, hypocoatings, infillings and intercalations. Because the most prominent textural pedofeatures are clay coatings, this chapter focuses mainly on this type of textural feature, its development and occurrence. Information about other textural features, such as coarse-grained coatings and depletion hypocoatings, is reviewed as well.

Clay illuviation was one of the first pedogenic processes to be recognised in micropedology (Kubiëna, 1943; Frei & Cline, 1949), and the resulting features may first have been documented by Agafonoff (1936, p. 73). This process is associated with the removal of clay from upper horizons and its redeposition as clay coatings and infillings in deeper horizons. The fundamental micromorphological characteristics of clay coatings and their occurrence were first described in detail by Minashina (1958) and Stephen (1960). Much earlier, in 1915, key micromorphological features of clay coatings and infillings had already been described by Polynov, who considered these features to have formed by mineral authigenesis (Polynov, 1915). Next was Kubiëna (1937), who described clay coatings, without using this term, as 'a layer of fine particles with varnish-like lustre covering voids' and used the expression 'fluidal structure' (Fluidalgefüge) to describe this feature. The terms 'optically oriented clay' (e.g., Brewer & Blackmore, 1956) and 'clay films' (e.g., Miedema et al., 1999) have also been used synonymously. Several other terms have been used in micromorphological publications to describe clay coatings (Table 1).

Clay coating formation due to neoformation of clay - first proposed by Polynov (1915) - was a widely accepted explanation amongst early Russian micromorphologists (e.g., Parfenova & Yarilova, 1957). This presumed a complete decay of minerals in the groundmass, setting free silicium, aluminium or iron oxides, which moved slowly down the profile. They were supposed to recombine in the course of this movement, forming new authigenic clay minerals (Parfenova et al., 1964). These neoformed clay minerals were named polynite, after B.B. Polynov.

# 2. Clay Coatings

# 2.1 General Characteristics

Clay coatings (Fig. 1) are typically characterised by a continuous orientation of clay particles parallel to the surface with which they are associated. Since the thickness of a thin section is about  $30\mu \mathrm{m}$ , the light passes through many clay particles. If these are randomly oriented, the effects of all individual particles, in terms of birefringence, will compensate one another, resulting in optically isotropic behaviour.

If clay particles are oriented parallel to one another, addition of the effects of the individual particles will take place and the domain will act as a single crystal with distinctive optical properties (e.g., Fernández et al., 2006). Therefore, clay coatings display parallel extinction and positive elongation, relative to the covered surface.

FIGURE 1 Limpid illuvial clay coatings with characteristic extinction bands (XPL). Note microlaminations in the clay coating (right).

If the coating is curved, extinction lines sweep through it when the stage is rotated (e.g., FitzPatrick, 1993).

Interference colours depend on the mineralogical composition: first-order grey indicates 1:1 or 2:1:1 phyllosilicates, whereas higher interference colours indicate 2:1 phyllosilicates. Interference colours may be modified or masked by various organic and inorganic compounds. Pure clay coatings are greyish, but in most cases the presence of iron oxides gives them a yellowish or reddish colour. Polynov (1915), Parfenova and Yarilova (1957) and Stephen (1960) mentioned distinct pleochroism of some clay coatings, e.g., from dark brown to yellowish brown. Nevertheless no attention has been paid to this phenomenon and the descriptions of clay coatings usually have no data on pleochroism, although it appears to be common in palaeosols (Kuhn, unpublished data).

Other common characteristics of clay coatings in thin sections include (i) a marked textural contrast with the adjacent groundmass, in both PPL and XPL (this may be less clear in some clayey soils), with sharp boundaries, (ii) their location on the surface of peds and other macropore walls, (iii) the presence of microlaminations, and (iv) the presence of organic particles reflected by darker colours and a more speckled appearance. The third and fourth of these characteristics are common but not ubiquitous.

# 2.2 Confusion With Micromorphologically Similar Features

In general, illuvial clay coatings can be easily identified by the aforementioned characteristics (Section 2.1). However, they may occasionally be confused with other features, such as those described below.

Authigenic clay coatings - Coatings formed by clay neoformation can in some cases be distinguished based on the orientation of the clay particles, because it is occasionally perpendicular to the pore walls in authigenic clay coatings and always parallel to the pore walls for illuvial clay coatings (Bullock & Thompson, 1985; Mulyanto & Stoops, 2003; Stoops, 2003; Kuhn & Pietsch, 2013; see also Mees, 2010, 2018). Neoformation of clay is often observed in soils with a high percentage of volcanic fragments (Jongmans et al., 1994). Optically isotropic thin clay coatings and infillings in buried Andosols were described as authigenic precipitates by Sedov et al. (2003), who interpret their optical behaviour as indicative of their amorphous nature or of poor orientation of halloysitedominant clay. Isotropic clay coatings partly recrystallised to birefringent clay coatings were described in Oxisols on andesitic volcanic material in Indonesia (Buurman & Jongmans, 1987). However, isotropic coatings, as well as optically anisotropic features along pore walls, can also be artifacts of resin polymerisation during sample impregnation for thin section preparation (Morras, 1983a).

Pressure faces – In the field it is difficult to distinguish between intrusive clay coatings and pressure faces (slickensides), which are formed by orientation of clay particles due to repeated swelling and shrinking in clayey materials. However, in thin sections pressure faces show characteristics different from clay coatings. In PPL, pressure faces have

diffuse boundaries and no occurrences of lamination are visible. In XPL, the presence of pressure faces is indicated by porostriation along the sides of peds (see also Kovda & Mermut, 2010, 2018) and extinction lines, which are typical of clay coatings, are absent. Stress-deformed clay coatings are somewhat more difficult to distinguish from pressure faces than undisturbed coatings in clayey soils. Nevertheless, clay coatings usually contain more fine clay than the groundmass, whereas pressure faces have the same texture as the groundmass.

Goethite - Goethite surrounding pores and peds may display an apparent orientation and interference colours similar to those of illuvial clay and may even be laminated (Bullock & Thompson, 1985; Sauer et al., 2013). At high magnification a distinction is possible, if goethite crystals are identifiable (see also Stoops & Marcelino, 2010, 2018).

Straw - In surface horizons, radial sections through straw may look similar to channel coatings: egg-yellow colour, limpid, grey interference colours masked by the colour of the material (Stoops, 2003). Careful examination of the morphology, however, can avoid mistakes.

Altered rock fragments and mineral grains - Aggregates consisting of strongly parallel-oriented fine clay, formed by weathering of phyllosilicate grains (often biotite) or shales (Fig. 2) (e.g., Mermut & Pape, 1973) may be confused with fragments of illuvial clay coatings. Fragments of (unaltered) clayey parent materials, e.g., in colluvial soils or fragments of surface crusts, may also have the appearance of fragments of clay coatings (Fig. 2). Opaline and/or allophanic bodies with micromorphological characteristics similar to those of fragments of clay coatings are common in some Andosols (see Sedov et al., 2010; Stoops et al., 2018).

Phosphate coatings and infillings - These pedofeatures occur in waterlogged environments and in soils enriched in phosphates by bird or bat droppings or through various types of human activity. Their occurrence and nature have been described by Goldberg and Macphail (2006) and Karkanas and Goldberg (2010, 2018). Amorphous and cryptocrystalline phosphate pedofeatures commonly have colours similar to those typical

for clay coatings or infillings (colourless, yellow, brown, reddish), with first-order white to second-order yellow interference colours. However, they can be easily distinguished from clay coatings by their characteristic green colour under blue light fluorescence. In addition, phosphate coatings have often a radiating fanlike internal orientation.

# 2.3 Formation

# 2.3.1 General Aspects

Based on evidence from detailed micromorphological studies from a wide variety of soils and experimental studies, both in laboratory conditions and in the field, the formation of clay coatings in B horizons is related with clay eluviation/illuviation processes and generally attributed to the vertical translocation of fine clay suspended in percolating soil water (Altemüller, 1956; Brewer & Haldane, 1957; Karpachevskiy, 1960; Buol & Hole, 1961; Brewer & Sleeman, 1970; Bullock et al., 1974; Gagarina & Tsyplenkov, 1974; De Coninck et al., 1976; Dobrovol'ski et al., 1976; Howitt & Pawluk, 1985; Theocharopoulos & Dalrymple, 1987; Ponomarenko et al., 1988; Stephan, 2000). This is supported by non-micromorphological evidence, such as the observation that clay coatings and the clay fraction of the eluvial horizon commonly have similar mineralogical compositions, whereas the mineralogical compositions of clay coatings and the clay fraction of the peds in the illuvial horizon can be different (Khalifa & Buol, 1968; Ranney & Beatty, 1969).

In other studies, clay coatings in Retisols and Luvisols have been demonstrated to include a large relative amount of minerals with unstable lattice, so that their quantitative mineralogical composition is intermediate between that of the clay fraction of E and Bt horizons (Grossman et al., 1964; Miller et al., 1971; Targulian et al., 1974b; Sokolova et al., 1988). In other cases, the quantitative mineralogical composition of clay coatings (fraction  $< 1\mu \mathrm{m}$ ) reveals some variability but is generally closer to the mineralogical composition of the same fraction in the groundmass of the related Bt horizon than to that of the overlying A and E horizons (Beke & Zwarich, 1971; Ogleznev, 1971; Targulian et al., 1974b; Rusanova, 1978; Birina, 1980; Targulian & Tselischeva, 1983; Bronnikova & Targulian, 2005). The quantitative mineralogical composition of the  $10 - 50\mu \mathrm{m}$  and  $50 - 250\mu \mathrm{m}$  fractions of silt-clay coatings in Retisols is closer to the composition of the same fractions in the eluvial horizons than in groundmass of the Bt horizons (Bronnikova & Targulian, 2005). The authors hypothesise alteration of less stable minerals in the upper horizons caused by acid hydrolysis, accompanied by clay eluvation, followed by eluvation of other components of the fine earth fraction of the eluvial horizon, implying that clay illuviation started earlier than vertical silt-clay and sand-clay translocation in the studied profiles. This conclusion is supported by micromorphological evidence obtained by semiquantitative analysis of layer sequences within compound coatings (Bronnikova & Targulian, 2005).

However, differences between the clay mineral associations in clay coatings and in peds of Bt horizons can be also related to the difficulty in obtaining pure samples of clay coatings (Beke & Zwarich, 1971).

Although clay coatings exclusively composed of coarse clay have been reported (e.g., Eswaran, 1979), and although clay coatings commonly contain a more or less considerable admixture of silt and even sand particles (Fedoroff, 1972; Targulian et al., 1974b), the eluviation/illuviation process usually involves fine clay particles, smaller than  $0.2\mu \mathrm{m}$  (Grossman et al., 1964; Kovenya, 1972). This process can be subdivided into the following three stages (Blume, 1964; Duchaufour, 1982; Stephan, 2000; Miedema, 2002), favoured by alternating wet and dry conditions (Gombeer & D'Hoore, 1971):

Dispersion - First, clay dispersion is required, because most clay particles are aggregated in small clusters up to  $250~\mu \mathrm{m}$  (Edwards & Bremner, 1967). The main factors affecting clay dispersion and thus its mobilisation are the type of clay minerals, the particle size, the presence or absence of cementing agents (e.g., iron oxides, carbonates, humus), pH, the types of cations present, the electrolyte concentration in the soil solution and its content in dissolved organic matter (e.g., Atanasescu et al., 1974; Duchaufour, 1982; Dorronsoro & Aguilar, 1988; van den Broek, 1989).

Downward transport - Water, carrying clay particles in suspension, percolates through conducting pores and infiltrates into deeper, drier horizons as laminar flow along the pore walls (Theocharopoulos & Dalrymple, 1987). Experiments with radioactive tracers showed more difficult particle  $(<0.5\mu \mathrm{m})$  movement in materials with a large specific surface (Melnikov & Kovenya, 1974). Clay particles are transported without undergoing any major chemical or physical transformation. However, the presence and concentrations of certain cations in solution influence the movement of kaolinite and montmorillonite differently, whereas some ion species have no effect on the mobility of clay (Hallsworth, 1963). In calcareous soils, high  $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$  concentrations may inhibit clay illuviation (e.g., Elliot & Drohan, 2009), but this is not always the case (e.g., Pal et al., 2003). Dispersion of clay in non-calcareous A horizons of calcareous soils can be sufficient to develop illuvial clay coatings in lower parts of the profile (Poch et al., 2013).

Because of the higher suction by micropores compared to macropores, water is absorbed into unsaturated materials. Since the clay particles cannot enter the micropores, a thin film of suspension coats the macropore walls (Bullock & Thompson, 1985; Dorronsoro & Aguilar, 1988; Fernandez et al., 2006). The greater the depth reached by the suspension, the higher its concentration in clay (Gombeer & D'Hoore, 1971). The translocation of clay suspensions can reach several metres (e.g., Teruggi & Andreis, 1971; Goss et al., 1973; Targulian et al., 1974a; Johnson et al., 2003; Moretti & Morras, 2013). The main factors involved are the amount and the velocity of percolating water, the concentration of suspended clay and the soil porosity.

Deposition - Clay deposition occurs when (i) the infiltration of the suspension stops because the water supply has stopped, particularly if percolating water is hindered by active roots at the depth of their maximum concentration (Runge, 1973), (ii) a level with low macroporosity or entrapped air is reached, or (iii) a higher electrolyte concentration causes flocculation (Dorronsoro & Aguilar, 1988). Also a decrease in water velocity may result in the deposition of suspended clay (Duchaufour, 1982). Upon suction of the water into fine voids, clay particles are filtered by the pore walls and a clay coating is formed

with clay particles oriented parallel to the walls (Bullock & Thompson, 1985). In horizontal channels clay coatings have usually the same thickness at the upper and lower side (Fig. 3) (Van Ranst et al., 1980; Dorronsoro & Aguilar, 1988).

During the next wet period, this process may be repeated, resulting in an increasingly thicker clay coating. Besides suction, evaporation is also an important process. This is illustrated by the formation of clay coatings in sandy materials, which form by slow evaporation causing a gradual reduction of the water menisci and the retention of clay suspensions on the surface of sand grains by adsorption and capillary forces (Van Ranst et al., 1980; Sullivan, 1994). Eventually, very stable, concave (Fig. 4) and sometimes convex clay bridges between sand grains are formed.

Experiments with drainage of clay suspensions (Sullivan, 1994) through columns of coarse quartz sand show that clay coatings can also develop from flow of suspensions within wet soil material. This suggests that dry soil material is not required for the formation of coatings of well-oriented clay. The thickness of clay coatings formed on impermeable or wet sandy material is a direct function of the clay concentration of the suspension, which implies that the higher the clay concentration, the thicker the clay coatings in this type of material.

Thick clay coatings with sharp boundaries, continuous orientation and sharp extinction bands have been also experimentally obtained by repeated addition of the same clay suspension to Bt blocks after 40 application/drying cycles (Akamigbo & Dalrymple, 1985) or 100 cycles applied on synthetic sponges (Theocharopoulos & Dalrymple, 1987).

It should be stressed that not all clay coatings point to a process of clay translocation from one horizon into another, i.e., that the presence of clay coatings does not automatically imply the (former) occurrence of an overlying eluvian horizon. Vertical or lateral translocations within the same horizon are probably more common than presumed (Laves & Thiere, 1970; Mermut & Pape, 1971; Laves, 1972; Smith & Wilding, 1972; Targulian et al., 1974a; Kovalev, 1975; Baize, 1989; van den Broek, 1989) but are

morphologically not distinguishable from clay coatings resulting from accumulation of clay derived from A and E horizons.

Snow meltwater can be responsible for the formation of clay coatings and layered clay coatings as described for surficial sediments of the Transantarctic Mountains (van der Meer et al., 1993; van der Meer & Menzies, 2011), showing that clay illuviation can occur even in areas with low temperatures, which complicates the interpretation of clay coatings in terms of palaeoclimatic conditions.

# 2.3.2 Specific Types of Clay Coatings

Independent of the parent material, the occurrence and characteristics of clay coatings may indicate different (in many cases at least three) phases of clay illuviation leading to the formation of Bt horizons (e.g., Thiere & Laves, 1968; Weir et al., 1971; Fedoroff, 1972; Eimberck-Roux, 1977; Bullock & Murphy, 1979; Felix-Henningsen, 1979; Fedoroff & Courty, 1987; Tursina, 1989; Payton, 1992, 1993; Van Vliet-Lanoë et al., 1992; Rogaar et al., 1993; Kemp et al., 1998; Kühn, 2003b; Bronnikova & Targulian, 2005). Different types of clay coatings, with different limpidity and degree of sorting, may develop depending on the grain size and type of compounds involved and on the phase of the clay translocation process.

Very dusty, greyish-black clay coatings (commonly with a small amount of silt), moderately to well sorted, usually with weak parallel orientation of the clay particles (diffuse or absent extinction pattern, low brightness of interference colours), sometimes microlaminated, are preferentially found covering the lower part of horizontal channels (Fig. 5) (Kuhn, 2003a) or as the inner layer of layered coatings.

The dark colour is mainly caused by finely dispersed organic matter. They mostly correspond to the youngest phase of clay illuviation, typically in E and upper Bt horizons of loamy material (Gagarina & Tsyplenkov, 1974; Kuhn, 2003a), below plough layers (see Section 4.3) or in colluvial materials (Kwaad & Mucher, 1977, 1979; Bolt et al., 1980). These very dusty clay coatings also occur in Luvian Phaeozems of deciduous forests

(Urusevskaya et al., 1987; Gerasimova et al., 1996), as well as in natric horizons of Solonetzes (Morras, 1978; Gerasimova et al., 1996; Lebedeva-Verba & Gerasimova, 2009). The occurrence of dark clay coatings rich in organic matter can be related to degradation of mollic horizons (Alexandrovskiy & Birina, 1987; Loyko et al., 2015). Similar coatings were also described for soils in arid environments, including Gypsisols as well as Solonchaks assumed to have formed by degradation of Solonetz that developed in milder conditions (Lebedeva et al., 2015). They have also been reported for Holocene palaeosols considered to have developed in a slightly redoximorphic environment in mountain valleys (Moretti et al., 2012).

Dusty greyish-black clay coatings are also commonly associated with deforestation (Thompson et al., 1990) or other anthropogenic changes (e.g., Slager & Van de Wetering, 1977; Macphail, 1986; Kuhn, 2003a) and have been used as indicators of early cultivation (e.g., Macphail et al., 1987, 1990; Usai, 2001). Their absence can obviously not be taken for the absence of human activities, as very dusty clay coatings have been recognised for horizons influenced by well-documented land use (Carter & Davidson, 1998; Adderley et al., 2010, 2018). A particular case of combined clay and organic carbon illuviation is contamination of clay by coal-mining products (Solntseva & Rubilina, 1987). Admixtures of coal dust  $(<250\mu \mathrm{m})$  were discovered in clay coatings at depths of up to  $1.7\mathrm{m}30$  years after its surface deposition. Clay coatings enriched with dispersed organic matter or fine charcoal particles have also been reported for soil profiles with Bt horizons that became buried by habitation deposits of medieval settlements (Murasheva et al., 2012).

Dusty clay coatings (see Fig. 6), moderately to well sorted, with moderate to good parallel orientation of the clay particles, containing quartz and small opaque particles of different origins, such as Fe and Ti oxides (Smolikova, 1968; Chartres, 1987) and heavy mineral grains (Felix-Henningsen, 1979), with a particle size between 1 and  $5\mu \mathrm{m}$ , are frequent in E and upper Bt horizons. The speckled appearance in PPL is caused by the admixture of opaque particles, but sharp extinction lines are visible in XPL. These coatings have been also described as clay coatings with granulation (Granulierung; Kubiëna, 1986) or as grainy coatings (Chartres, 1987) and should not be confused with

The sharp extinction bands (white arrows in XPL) indicate good orientation of the clay particles in (ii) and (iii).

clay coatings having a speckled b-fabric (granular extinction pattern; FitzPatrick, 1993) resulting from reorientation of clay (see Section 2.4.1). Dusty clay coatings do not clearly correspond to a specific phase of the clay illuviation process and their dusty appearance has been attributed to ageing of former clay coatings (e.g., Bronger, 1969/1970). However, this is questionable, since these dusty coatings have been found also in young soils (Kuhn, 2003a).

Limpid clay coatings (Figs. 1, 3 and 6), with continuous orientation, sharp extinction bands, high intensity of interference colours (with colours depending on mineralogical composition and iron oxide masking), good sorting, no cracks, sharp boundaries and usually completely covering the pore walls with a constant thickness (mostly  $50 - 100\mu \mathrm{m}$ ) are associated with a final phase of clay illuviation (e.g., Rogaar et al., 1993; Miedema et al., 1999; Kuhn, 2003a) and are frequent in Bt and often in C horizons (Stephan, 2000). These limpid coatings are lacking small contrasting particles. Slow transport of clay explains the good sorting.

Non-gravitational migration and slow evaporation lead to the formation of these coatings, since fine clay suspensions are very stable and can be held by capillary water at low matrix suction (Gombeer & D'Hoore, 1971). This is not only the case of ascended water transport (Brewer & Haldane, 1957) but also of water migrations from the groundmass to the evaporating surfaces of peds and channel walls (Gombeer & D'Hoore, 1971).

The above types of coatings may occur independently or as part of layered textural coatings (Fig. 6) (see Section 3.2).

# 2.4 Destruction and Alteration

Clay coatings do not remain undisturbed in the soil. Chemical and mechanical processes may result in their alteration or fragmentation.

# 2.4.1 Mechanical Processes

The most important processes leading to mechanical fragmentation or deformation of clay coatings are described below. The former process results in the presence of fragments of clay coatings, termed 'papules' by Brewer (1964). However, this term is not restricted to clay-coating fragments but also applies to fragments of weathered shale, surface crusts and weathered biotite.

Reorientation - The original continuous orientation of clay in clay coatings can be lost by internal stress that produces a stipple-speckled b-fabric (cf. McCarthy & Plint, 1998) (flecked orientation; Brewer, 1976). The reorganisation of the clay results in randomly oriented clay domains within the coatings (Fig. 6). FitzPatrick (1993) attributes the reorganisation to ageing of the clay coating and proposes four stages, from weak to complete, whereby a stipple-speckled b-fabric is reached at the final stage.

Bioturbation - This process fragments the coatings, generally without deforming them (Mermut & Jongerius, 1980). A microstructure dominated by channels and passage features suggests that clay-coating fragmentation was caused by bioturbation (Fig. 7) (see also Kooistra & Pulleman, 2010, 2018). The degree of reworking can be expressed quantitatively (see Section 5). Features related to bioturbation have been found to be more abundant in soils lacking clay-illuvial features than in associated soils with Bt horizons, suggesting that bioturbation can destroy illuvial horizons or prevent their formation (Blanco & Stoops, 2007).

Colluvial transport – If colluvial processes involve erosion of argic horizons or clayey parent materials, this can induce fragmentation of clay coatings and lead to the presence of a large amount of fragments of clay coatings or of clayey aggregates in the soil (Fig. 8)

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/66d00398-60f3-4b9c-850e-aa2e8642069d/5b2153adaa23f3ed902cd81d2b3bb69f98a719401daf7f7e511bc298b20f5d98.jpg)

(Mücher, 1974; see also Mücher et al., 2010, 2018). The fragments very often have angular shapes, although they can also be subrounded.

They can be derived from clay coatings exposed and dried at the soil surface, which are rather stable. When fragments of Bt horizons are not completely distorted and still contain complete clay coatings, care has to be taken with interpretation, avoiding confusion with occurrences of coatings that formed in situ. The recognition of other features pointing to colluvial processes (see Mücher et al., 2010, 2018) can confirm the presence of fragments of Bt horizons.

Argilloturbation - Differential movements in the soil, caused by shrinking and swelling of clays, can destroy the coatings and infillings by shear in materials with a porphyric c/f-related distribution pattern (Fig. 9) (Castellet & FitzPatrick, 1974). The continuous orientation in the coatings is thus lost and replaced by a striated orientation. This situation does not always develop (Altemüller & Bailly, 1976), but it is often recognised in well-developed hydromorphic Bt horizons ('dynamic B horizons'; Fedoroff, 1968) and in clayey argic horizons (see Section 4.2.3). Fragmented clay coatings are also common in Vertisols and sometimes show a kinkband fabric (Morras et al., 1993; Stoops, 2003; see Kovda & Mermut, 2010, 2018). Kinkband fabrics have also been observed for nonfragmented deformed coatings in clayey soils (Stoops, 2013).

Cryoturbation - Frost action can be responsible for fragmentation of clay coatings and infillings (Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1985; Bouza et al., 2005) (see also Van Vliet-Lanoë, 2010; Van Vliet-Lanoë & Fox, 2018). Its role is again confirmed by the recognition of other freeze-thaw features (Fig. 10) (e.g., Kühn, 2003b).

Crystallisation of pedogenic minerals - The growth of, for example, calcite crystals (Fig. 9) or gypsum crystals (Fig. 11) can bring about the fragmentation and/or disorganisation of clay coatings (e.g., Gile & Grossman, 1968; Bouza & del Valle, 1998; Khademi & Mermut, 2003; Dultz & Kuhn, 2005).

# 2.4.2 Alteration and Secondary Illuviation

Chemical alteration of clay coatings is limited, because these features are relatively stable. Decomposition by ferrolysis in seasonally wet acid soils has been documented (Brinkman et al., 1973). These authors observed that the original limpid coatings of well-oriented clay gradually become seemingly optically isotropic and greyish, with a characteristic grainy limpidity. They exhibit a bright bluish-white 'opalescent' lustre when viewed with oblique incident light. As these patterns may cross the original microlaminations, it is clear that they postdate deposition. In extreme cases, only scattered

fine black grains between bare grains of silt and sand are visible, pointing to an almost complete destruction of the clay. XRD analyses indicate a high percentage of fine quartz in the altered coatings, and microchemical analyses point to a high Ti content (Beke & Zwarich, 1971; Chartres, 1987).

Some studies (Morras, 1979; Van Ranst & De Coninck, 2002; Boixadera et al., 2003; Boivin et al., 2004; Van Ranst et al., 2011) question the validity of ferrolysis, offering alternative mechanisms to explain the degradation of clay in clay coatings. However, the authors do not suggest a solution for the occurrence of fine quartz particles across clay coatings as described in detail by Brinkman et al. (1973). Breakdown of coarser quartz grains and illuviation of such fine quartz can happen but should be reflected by the presence of microlamina in the coatings. Moreover, the process of ferrolysis resulting in the degradation of clay in clay coatings (Brinkman et al., 1973) has been also documented for clays in the groundmass (e.g., Miedema et al., 1987).

Chemical alteration of clay coatings may also lead to a phenomenon described as secondary illuviation (De Coninck & Herbillon, 1969; Fedoroff, 1972; Ducoux, 1976; Eimerbeck-Roux, 1977). When a large amount of channels are filled with illuvial clay, redoximorphic conditions may develop, primarily in Bt/E transition zones and in the upper part of Bt horizons. This induces the reduction and removal of iron oxides from the clay in the groundmass and in the coatings. This Fe-free clay is more easily dispersed and translocated than clay containing iron oxides (Jamagne, 1972; De Coninck et al., 1976). Deposited in lower parts of glossic tongues and Bt horizons, this clay forms thick white or yellowish white clay coatings with continuous orientation or silt-clay coatings with weak orientation of the clay (Fedoroff, 1972; Jamagne & Jeanson, 1978; Dorronsoro & Aguilar, 1988), which macroscopically correspond to thick greyish clay coatings (Jamagne, 1972). In soils with redoximorphic features, these coatings can occur together

with clay depletion phenomena (Jamagne et al., 1987) (see also Lindbo et al., 2010; Vepraskas et al., 2018). Another possible indication of redistribution of illuvial clay is the occurrence of coatings with high microporosity, without any signs of chemical weathering (Morras, 1983b).

For tropical soils, Nahon (1991) distinguishes two main types of transformation: (i) those involving redistribution of constituents within the coating, such as iron oxide migration (e.g., Stoops, 1967; Bocquier & Nalovic, 1972; Boulange et al., 1975), and (ii) those involving a change in chemical or mineralogical composition. The latter can be 'subtractive', referring to the occurrence of leaching and residual enrichment (e.g., kaolinite alteration with gibbsite formation; Boulange et al., 1975; Mpiana, 1980), or 'additive', referring to processes involving take-up of elements from the soil solution (e.g., Al-phosphate impregnation of kaolinite coatings; Flicoteaux et al., 1977).

# 2.5 Related Features

Infillings of illuvial clay must be interpreted cautiously, because tangential sections of coatings in channels may look like infillings (Stoops, 2003). Clay infillings frequently occur in the lower part of Bt horizons or, unrelated to depth, in Btb horizons (e.g., Sedov et al., 2001). Clay infillings were found in takyric Solonchaks at a depth of  $40\mathrm{cm}$  (Gerasimova et al., 1996) and in Bt horizons of Ultisols between 2 and  $4\mathrm{m}$  depth (Moretti & Morras, 2013).

Clay cappings with a minor admixture of silt grains have been attributed to meltwater processes during thawing of permafrost (see Van Vliet-Lanoë, 2010; Van Vliet-Lanoë & Fox, 2018) and have mainly been reported for E horizons (Kühn, 2003a).

Clay intercalations have been reported for Takyr soils of the Near East, below and at the base of argic horizons of the Niger delta, and were attributed to waterlogging (Fedoroff & Courty, 1987). Sauer et al. (2013) explained the formation of clay intercalations in Stagnic Albeluvisols from Norway as a result of penetration, under pressure, of clay-carrying and clay-mobilising solutions from albeluvic tongues into the groundmass of the Btg horizon. Intercalations are not always clearly distinguishable (Stoops, 2003) and still little information exists about intercalations since the term was introduced by Bullock et al. (1985). Fragmentation of intercalations by cracking, and deformation by calcite nodule growth, was reported by Badía et al. (2013).

# 3. Textural Pedofeatures Other Than Clay Coatings

# 3.1 Coarse-Grained Coatings

Coarse-grained textural pedofeatures, in the form of silty coatings on ped surfaces, occur predominantly in Retisols, Luvisols and Solonetzes. Although some occurrences have been attributed to authigenic quartz formation (e.g., Parfenova, 1956; Brewer, 1964), they typically form by depletion or illuviation.

Development of sandy-silty coatings and infillings as residual in situ accumulation of coarse-grained material due to removal of clay-sized material along ped surfaces was first suggested by Frei and Cline (1949) and further elaborated in many later publications (e.g., Arnold, 1963; Grossman et al., 1964; Curmi, 1987; Szymanski et al., 2011). Depletion in fine material can involve interaction with acid solutions and eluviation of weathering products along preferential flow paths (Grossman et al., 1964; Nettleton et al., 1994). Redox conditions can play a role, whereby clay becomes more mobile when iron and manganese have been removed (e.g., Vepraskas et al., 1994, 2018; Lindbo et al., 2010).

Coarse-grained coatings and infillings can also form as illuvial features, which can be recognised based on various characteristics, such as the occurrence of underlying illuvial clay coatings, sharp lower boundaries and dissimilarities in distribution and orientation patterns of coarse material between the groundmass and the coating or infilling (Targulian et al., 1974a; Nettleton et al., 1994; Bronnikova & Targulian, 2005). The possibility of vertical translocation of silt- and sand-sized particles was demonstrated by non-micromorphological laboratory and field experiments (Wright & Foss, 1968; Locke, 1986; Fishkis et al., 2010).

Illuvial silt and very fine sand coatings have been reported for the lower part of clayeluvial horizons (McKeague et al., 1973a, 1973b; von Zeenschwitz, 1979/80; Gerasimova et al., 1996; Bronnikova et al., 2000), the upper part of Bt horizons (Targulian et al., 1974a, 1974b; Targulian & Vishnevskaya, 1975; Morras, 1983b), in fissures in Bt horizons (Targulian, 1974a, 1974b; Targulian & Vishnevskaya, 1975; Gerasimova et al., 1996; Spiridonova et al., 1999) and horizons underlying Bt horizons (Nettleton et al., 1994). In a toposequence study, abundant silt coatings have been recognised to form by vertical illuviation, whereas clay was mainly transported laterally, resulting in partial clogging of pores downslope (Lahmar & Bresson, 1987). The detachment of coarse particles is favoured by rapid wetting of dry soils, drainage of saturated soil materials and thawing of frozen soils. It occurs when the shear stress of water flowing in channels, cracks or fissures exceeds forces retaining particles in the groundmass. Low organic carbon, Fe, Ca and Mg content, low aggregate stability, pore size discontinuities and high silt content favour the formation of silt and very fine sand coatings (Nettleton et al., 1994). In Retisols (Albeluvisols, Alfisols), coarse-grained illuvial and depletion features can occur within the same profile or even within the same horizon (Targulian et al., 1974a; Bullock & Thompson, 1985; Bronnikova & Targulian, 2005; Szymanski et al., 2011).

The common occurrence of silt coatings in frost-affected soils (see Van Vliet-Lanoë, 2010; Van Vliet-Lanöe & Fox, 2018) has led to their use as indicators of downward translocation of coarse material in soils formerly affected by frost action (Fedoroff & Goldberg, 1982, Kemp, 1985; Rose et al., 2000).

Silt coatings and infillings have also been attributed to a rearrangement of silt-sized particles in vesicles of vesicular layers of desert soils (Sullivan & Koppi, 1991; Lebedeva et al., 2015). Silt coatings in duripans within argic horizons of subtropical soils in semiarid regions were considered to be relict features (Nettleton et al., 1989).

Silty clay and clayey silt coatings as well as unsorted coatings are widely spread in argic horizons of boreal and subboreal soils of Eurasia and North America (Fedoroff, 1974; Targulian et al., 1974a; Targulian & Tselischeva, 1983; Bullock & Thompson, 1985; Gerasimova et al., 1996). Silty clay and clayey silt coatings contain variable proportions of clay and silt. Unsorted coatings are a mixture of clay, silt and sand particles, with a grain size distribution that is different from that of the surrounding groundmass.

Silty clay, clayey silt and unsorted coatings that are enriched in organic matter, mostly in the form of silt-sized particles, have been regarded as evidence of agricultural practices (see Section 4.3). The term 'agricutans' was introduced by Jongerius (1970) for this type of coatings. However, not all occurrences can be linked to former agricultural land use (e.g., Usai, 1998, 2001), although they do characterise contemporary ploughed soils (e.g., Eimberck-Roux, 1977).

Weakly oriented coarse clay and silt covering the larger conducting pores have been reported in soils flooded with water containing fine material in suspension (the so-called flood coatings). These coatings are assumed to form within one to 2 years and to be quickly destroyed (Brammer, 1971). Thompson (1983) pointed out the possibility that coatings with the same properties as mentioned above may form in well-drained soils without any flooding, possibly as a result of cultivation.

# 3.2 Layered Coatings

Layered coatings consist of layers with materials of different size classes, including material coarser than clay (Stoops, 2003). Brewer (1964), describing them as a type of 'compound cutans', attributed their layered fabric to alternating conditions during their formation. This is supported by experiments reported by Theocharopoulos and Dalrymple (1987; see Section 2.3.1), who produced layered coatings by imposing variations in suspension composition (clay, silt, Fe oxides organic matter). This implies that variations in source material and/or soil conditions are required, whereby illuvial material can be derived from different parts of the eluvial horizons or it can record different stages of weathering or pedogenesis. A sequence of different layers can in principle be interpreted as time-sequence of specific migration and accumulation conditions.

The occurrence of layered coatings often increases with increasing depth in Bt horizons (Chartres, 1987), with possible differences between intrapedal and interpedal voids (Bronnikova &Targulian, 2005). Clear sharp boundaries of the layers indicate that the illuviation process was either active over several events or had variable intensity (Kuhn, 2003a). Gradual merging boundaries could indicate development by chemical alteration rather than deposition (Chartres, 1987).

The formation of silt-clay coatings, without layering (Figs. 4 and 5), is explained by turbulent flow (Miedema, 2002) or secondary illuviation (see Section 2.4.2). They are mostly found in Bt horizons (e.g., Kuhn et al., 2006a; Nikorych et al., 2012). Formation of

layered coatings (Fig. 6) with clay and silt layers probably occurred in different phases: silt particles were translocated by rapid water movement during spring melt or heavy rain, whereas purely fine clay translocation took place during slow percolation (Dasog et al., 1987). On the other hand, mineralogical and microprobe analysis of coatings with alternating clay and silt layers showed in some cases that the silt layers have the same composition as the horizon in which they occur, whereas the composition of the clay layers is different from the surrounding groundmass but similar to that of the overlying horizons (Curmi, 1987).

The detailed description of the different layers and their order of appearance, as well as the relative distribution of various types of non-layered coatings, may provide relevant information about the different phases of material translocation and the relative age of the coatings (Jamagne & Jeanson, 1978; Remmelzwaal, 1979; Jamagne et al., 1987; Payton, 1993; Fedoroff, 1997; Bronnikova & Targulian, 2005).

# 3.3 Infillings

Abundant clay-silt infillings with variable organic matter content were described for A and B horizons of Mollisols from the humid Lowlands in Argentina (Pazos & Stoops, 1987). Those infillings, mainly formed by bioturbation, consist of material of under- or overlying horizons and are a characteristic feature of transitional horizons of Greyzems (Miedema et al., 1999), many Chernozems (Gerasimova et al., 1996) and Nitisols (Creutzberg & Sombroek, 1987).

Silt and sand infillings were observed (i) in Bt horizons (Spiridonova et al., 1999) or below Bt horizons (Nettleton et al., 1994), (ii) along surfaces of dry lakes and depressions of arid areas, (iii) in cracks and fissures (Fedoroff & Courty, 1987), and (iv) in vertical and horizontal fissures of takyric Solonchaks (Gerasimova et al., 1996). Similar processes as discussed in Section 2.3.1 for coarse-grained coatings may lead to the formation of those infillings. Infillings with reverse grading (i.e., increasing coarseness from bottom to the top) have been attributed to percolation of meltwater (Van Vliet & Langohr, 1981). Silt and sand infillings in the lower part of loess deposits have been related to erosional/ depositional processes coupled with synsedimentary loess deposition (Rognon et al., 1987).

# 3.4 Silt Cappings

Silt cappings, consisting of mainly silty material accumulated on top of coarse fragments or peds, were described for buried palaeosols (e.g., Ransom et al., 1987; Fedoroff et al., 1990) and as the result of periglacial processes in Fragipan horizons (e.g., Nettleton et al., 1968; FitzPatrick, 1976; Van Vliet & Langohr, 1981). These pedofeatures were also reported for well-drained coarse-grained Arctic soils, where they were attributed to silt mobilisation by direct rainfall, creating water-saturated conditions (Locke, 1986).

# 4. Horizons Related to Occurrences of Textural Pedofeatures

# 4.1 General Aspects

Textural pedofeatures have served as a diagnostic criterion for clay illuviation in various soil classification systems for many years (e.g., Soil Survey Staff, 1960, 2014; Avery, 1980; Soil Classification Working Group, 1998; Shishov et al., 2004; IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006, 2015). The presence of clay coatings is currently one of the requirements for the classification of diagnostic illuvial horizons such as the argic horizon (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015) and the argillic horizon (Soil Survey Staff, 2014).

The requirement that argillic/argic horizons must have illuvial clay coatings was questioned by McKeague (1983) particularly for strongly weathered soils of tropical and subtropical regions, which have B horizons with higher clay content than the material from which they are derived but no illuvial clay coatings. Those horizons were described as argillic/argic horizons without clay coatings (Nettleton et al., 1969) and the increase in clay and the absence of clay coatings attributed to either (i) neoformation of clay in the Bt horizon, or (ii) destruction of clay coatings and incorporation of the clay into the groundmass by reworking processes (Bronger & Bruhn, 1989, 1990). In contrast to these examples of tropical and subtropical soils with clay-rich horizons without clay coatings, illuvial clay coatings are in fact widespread in soils of this type in those regions. They were documented in argillic/argic horizons of tropical Acrisols/Ultisols (e.g., Fedoroff & Eswaran, 1985; Stoops, 1989), in kandic horizons of subtropical Ultisols (Moretti & Morras, 2013) and also beneath the ferralic/oxic horizon where they have a dark colour caused by iron staining (e.g., Nettleton et al., 1987; see also Marcelino et al., 2010, 2018). Brownish-red and partially weathered fragments of clay coatings have been also observed within oxic horizons in Brazil (Muggler & Buurman, 2000).

Apart from the generally accepted vertical clay illuviation, increased clay content in the B horizon has been attributed to other causes such as biological activity, textural discontinuity of the parent material, clay formation by in situ weathering of silicates, residual enrichment by dissolution of carbonates, chemical destruction of clay in the surface horizon and loss of clay by lateral superficial water flow (e.g., Smeck & Wilding, 1980; Baize, 1995; Soil Survey Staff, 2014; IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015). These processes, however, do not lead to the formation of clay coatings in subhorizons. The possibility of clay accumulation and formation of clay coatings due to lateral influx of clayey suspensions has to be considered (Kovalev, 1975; Legros, 1976).

In the last versions of Soil Taxonomy and WRB, the presence of illuvial clay is one of the diagnostic features, either required or optional, for agric, argillic, glossic, kandic and natric horizons (Soil Survey Staff, 2014) and for argic, natric and nitic horizons (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015). Diagnostic features include clay coatings along the sides of peds or channels, and clay bridges between mineral grains.

In the WRB system (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015), evidence of the illuvial nature of clay in argic and natric horizons is not a requirement. Soils with argic or natric horizons for which such evidence does exist are assigned with the cutanic qualifier.

Besides the discussed diagnostic horizons, the so-called beta-horizon also contains clay coatings as described in a number of micromorphological studies (see Section 4.6).

# 4.2 Argic Horizons

The micromorphological expression of argic horizons (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015) depends to a large extent on the texture and the porosity of the soil. This affects not only the particle size that can be transported but also influences the nature and size of the pores through which the illuviated particles move and the stability of the illuvial deposits formed. Different types of illuvial clay coatings and other textural pedofeatures occur depending on the parent material.

A classification of argic horizons on basis of the type and the micromorphological characteristics of the textural pedofeatures present was proposed by Fedoroff (1974) but rarely used.

# 4.2.1 Sandy Argic Horizons

In sandy materials, illuvial clay is usually concentrated in more or less thick bands, separated by zones without or with less clay, at a macroscopic scale (Miedema, 1987; Kemp & McIntosh, 1989). These bands can be found up to a depth of several metres (Rawling, 2000). Macroscopically similar bands can be of sedimentary origin, but these are easily distinguishable based on micromorphological properties, such as lack of orientation of clay around sand grains and the presence of close-porphyric c/f-related distribution patterns. Illuvial lamellae are also unrelated to bedding planes and may cut across the original stratification of the sediment (Dijkerman et al., 1967).

Soil porosity is made up of fairly continuous simple packing voids through which clay particles can pass. Illuvial clay occurs as concave bridges between grains ('meniscus-like clay bridges' after Altemüller, 1962) and as coatings on pebbles and grains (Dijkerman et al., 1967; Gile & Grossman, 1968; West et al., 1987) also in calcareous material (Wieder & Yaalon, 1978). These coatings and bridges are usually characterised by strong parallel orientation and by high intensity of the interference colours (Dijkerman et al., 1967; Bullock & Thompson, 1985). Concave bridges of oriented clay build up a concave gefuric c/f-related distribution pattern (see Fig. 4). Clay coatings cover and bridge the individual sand grains and give rise to a chitonic or chito-gefuric c/f-related distribution pattern (Fig. 12), which evolves to a close porphyric distribution when all packing pores are filled.

In a single horizon different degrees of infilling may occur. As long as the porphyric stage is not reached, stress deformation of coatings and infillings is absent, and their disturbance, mainly caused by bioturbation, yields fragments in which the continuous orientation of the clay is preserved. Bioturbation creates additional porosity which may become infilled by illuvial clay, eventually leading to an open porphyric c/f-related

FIGURE 12 Chito-gefuric c/f-related distribution pattern in a sandy argillic horizon. Note that nearly all grains are coated and connected by concave bridges of yellow-brown oriented clay.

distribution pattern. Once the close porphyric stage is passed, all fine material is composed of illuvial clay, which is susceptible to argilloturbation (see Section 2.4.1).

Whereas clay coatings on peds can be explained by suction and filtering of the clay suspension on the pore surface, this is not the case for sandy argic horizons. Besides the processes discussed in Section 2.3, in situ clay redistribution or weathering may lead to the formation of thin coatings composed of unsorted coarser clay without continuous orientation. Similar features have been also attributed to the formation of sericite along the weathering surface of feldspar grains (Arocena et al., 1992) and to the mechanical infiltration of materials external to the soil, such as muddy waters from overland flow (Buurman et al., 1998).

It has been demonstrated in experiments with sand columns that clay coatings on sand grains form in percolations using chloritic clay but not in those with illitic or smectitic clays (Matlack et al., 1989).

# 4.2.2 Loamy Argic Horizons

In soils with a medium texture, clay coatings occur mainly along conducting pores, i.e., in interpedal fissures, common in soils containing smectite, and in transpedal channels (Fedoroff & Eswaran, 1985). The illuvial clay may gradually fill the pores as infillings (Fig. 13; e.g., Szymański et al., 2011). Fragmentation of clay coatings is common in loamy argic horizons, which are often subjected to pedoturbation (see Section 2.4.1).

# 4.2.3 Clayey Arctic Horizons

In argic horizons with clayey texture of arid and Mediterranean climates, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to recognise clay coatings (Nettleton et al., 1969, Osman & Eswaran, 1974; Reynders, 1974; Verheye & Stoops, 1974; Scoppa, 1978; Imbellone & Giménez, 1990; Morras et al., 1993). This is due to (i) the small contrast between illuvial clay and clayey groundmass, and (ii) argilloturbation (see Section 2.4.1) related to the presence of swelling clays. The latter results in rapid incorporation of the coatings in the

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/66d00398-60f3-4b9c-850e-aa2e8642069d/d23e94916c9140b65ee44775d7e86c77512d84a5500d071a0ee1299a9acf1659.jpg)

groundmass or it can lead to deformation which renders the coatings therefore difficult to distinguish from the striated groundmass and slickensides.

Nevertheless, clay coatings between large hard particles, such as rock fragments, are protected and may remain intact. They are also more evident in the deepest horizons, because structural dynamics decrease with increasing depth and the coatings are more stable, remaining on the surface of the aggregates.

# 4.3 Agric Horizons

Agric horizons are subsurface horizons formed by illuviation of mechanically dispersed fine material in soils that have been under cultivation for a long time (Soil Survey Staff, 2014). They frequently occur immediately below Ap horizons.

In thin sections, agric horizons typically show thick coatings and infilling of weakly oriented, dark brown, coarse, dusty clay on ped surfaces and in channels. These dusty coatings may also contain silt-sized mineral grains and charcoal fragments, mixed with considerable amounts of organic material. They have also been called agricultans (Jongerius, 1970; see Section 2.3.2) and may occur juxtaposed on coatings of well-oriented fine clay (Jongerius, 1970; Kwaad & Mücher, 1979).

In Bt horizons of cultivated red soils in the Mediterranean region, these coatings are difficult to identify because of similarities with the adjacent groundmass, but they are easily detectable in C horizons (Fedoroff, 1997).

# 4.4 Natric Horizons

Natric horizons (Soil Survey Staff, 2014; IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015) are characterised by a well-developed angular blocky microstructure. The groundmass is mostly very rich in clay and has a well-developed striated b-fabric (e.g., Gerasimova et al., 1996; Oliveira et al., 2004a, 2004b). Natric horizons usually have thick clay coatings (Alexander & Nettleton, 1977; Lebedeva-Verba & Gerasimova, 2009), mostly with a yellowish grey

colour, a dotted or speckled appearance and moderately continuous orientation. These coatings are generally more massive and less yellow than clay coatings in argic horizons. According to Fedoroff and Courty (1986), clay coatings in natric horizons are thicker than those in argic horizons and are never laminated. However, Gerasimova et al. (1996) describes microlaminations with finely dispersed organic matter. Fragmentation of clay coatings as a result of argilloturbation, not to be confused with neoformation of clay from micas, have been also documented in natric horizons (Gerasimova et al., 1996; Oliveira et al., 2004a, 2004b).

# 4.5 Nitic Horizons

The presence of clay coatings is often observed in nitic horizons, but it is not a requirement for its classification. This is the diagnostic horizon of Nitisols (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015), which cover large areas in tropical and subtropical regions.

Rather thick (up to  $50~\mu \mathrm{m}$ ), microlaminated, well-oriented clay coatings as well as very thin ( $2 - 3\mu \mathrm{m}$ ) coatings of strongly oriented clay around grains and peds have been reported in nitic horizons (Creutzberg & Sombroek, 1987). These thin clay coatings (also called leptocoatings) are barely detectable with plane polarised light and are suggested to form by clay translocation within the same horizon (Creutzberg & Sombroek, 1987). Clear red or yellowish clay coatings with strong clay orientation were also described as characteristic non-Relic features in B and BC horizons of Nitisols in the lower Congo (Stoops, 1968), in Brazil (Oliveira et al., 2004b; Cooper & Vidal-Torrado, 2005) and in SW Ethiopia (De Wispelaere et al., 2015).

# 4.6 Beta-Horizons

The beta-horizon is a zone of clay accumulation, beneath a Bt horizon, just above the contact between a calcareous substrate and the overlying decalcified soil material. It is generally separated from the Bt horizon by a Bw or C horizon and is frequently situated relatively deep in the profile (often  $>2\mathrm{m}$ ) and therefore not always recognised during soil surveys.

Beta-horizons have a number of typical characteristics in thin sections (Bartelli & Odell, 1960; Ducloux, 1970; Mathieu & Stoops, 1974) such as:

- high porosity, mainly composed of channels and smooth vughs, reflecting intense biological activity; planar voids associated with moderately developed blocky microstructure were also documented for more shallow beta-horizons;  
- coarse mineral grains with the same composition as the coarse material of the overlying layers and with no evidence of important in situ weathering;  
- abundant thick coatings of strongly oriented fine clay around grains or on pore walls, frequently disturbed by faunal activity and/or physical processes, mostly cryoturbation; these coatings have the same composition as the illuvial clay coatings of the overlying argic horizon;

- coatings of coarse, dark, dotted clay, often covering the limpid clay coatings; these dark coatings are rich in organic matter and the organic matter content of beta-horizons is often higher than that of the overlying subsurface horizons.

There are several hypotheses concerning the nature of clay-dominated intervals above calcareous substrates: surface alteration of the limestone bedrock, subsurface limestone dissolution and accumulation of illuvial clay. The latter can be derived from overlying clayey sediments or loess (e.g., Mathieu & Stoops, 1974; Dewolf, 1976; Thiry & Trauth, 1976; Catt, 1986; Van Ranst et al., 2014). Illuvial beta-horizons can be confused in the field with buried in situ weathering layers of chalk. However, based on the above-mentioned characteristics, it is possible to distinguish between them (Ducloux, 1973; Mathieu & Stoops, 1974).

# 4.7 Argid Horizons in Palaeosols

In palaeosols with an argic horizon, the corresponding eluvial horizons are often missing in the soil profile. Generally, the Bt horizon is polygenetic and thus the result of more than one pedogenic process. In addition to different phases of clay illuviation, they can be affected by other pedogenic processes, such as water-logging, calcification, freezing and thawing, and bioturbation. Micromorphological investigations (e.g., Bronger, 1969/1970; Velichko & Morozova, 1970; Bullock & Murphy, 1979; Aguilar et al., 1983; Kemp, 1985; Dorronsoro & Aguilar, 1988; Bronger & Heinkele, 1989; Günster & Skowronek, 2001; Kühn, 2003c; Kühn et al., 2006b; Kadereit et al., 2010; Murasheva et al., 2012; Sycheva & Sedov, 2012; Alexandrovskiy et al., 2014) have allowed the identification of these processes and their chronology in buried Bt horizons. Micromorphological features reflecting a certain soil forming process can be related to environments in which those processes took place (Bronger et al., 1994). Clay coatings in intrapedal channels may point to an older phase of clay illuviation (Kemp, 1998). Also, joining of two or more stratigraphically different horizons must be taken into consideration (Stephan, 2000; Kemp, 2001). Conversion of buried A horizons into B horizons has been suggested for intervals in which excremental aggregates are covered by clay coatings (Kemp & Zárate, 2000; Zárate et al., 2002).

In European palaeosols and pedosequences, some Bt horizons are characterised by a high content of illuvial clay, up to  $30\%$ , compared to less than  $8\%$  for those formed since the last glaciation (Bullock & Thompson, 1985). Most illuvial clay can be present as fragmented clay coatings and sometimes has a different colour and pleochroism than clay coatings in Holocene argillic horizons (Bullock, 1985; Fedoroff, 1997). In the Mediterranean region, red clay coatings are thicker and more abundant in buried Bt horizons than in surface soils, in which fragments of red clay coatings frequently occur (Ortiz et al., 2002). Furthermore, thick, undisturbed compound clay coatings composed of layers of fragments of clay coatings alternating with limpid, yellow-brown clay coatings (Fig. 14) have been observed (Kuhn et al., 2006b).

Note ferruginous hypocoating on fragment of limpid, orange yellow-brown clay coating (turquoise arrow, lower left).

Relevant palaeoenvironmental information can be derived from assemblages of feature sets and their relationships in Bt horizons of palaeosols (see Fedoroff et al., 2010, 2018). Thin section observations allow also a better evaluation of geochemical data used as proxies for palaeoclimate. For example, the occurrence of fragments of clay coatings in buried mollic horizons explains higher weathering indexes than expected, because the horizons developed on redeposited material derived from soils with argic horizons (Kuhn et al., 2013).

# 4.8 Eluvian Horizons

By definition, illuvial features are generally absent in clay-eluvial horizons. These horizons may contain some illuvial clay-silt cappings, silt coatings and relatively thin clay coatings. However, clay coatings occur sometimes in the lower part of eluvial horizons (Thompson, 1987; Bronnikova et al., 2000), where they can be residual features of

degrading argic horizons (Thompson, 1987; Imbellone et al., 2016) and natric horizons (Morras, 1983b). A stipple-speckled b-fabric is occasionally present and has been interpreted as indicating clay neoformation in this setting (Kuhn, 2003a). Gorniak (1991) proposed new formation of clay coatings in E horizons of Luvisols in middle Europe, based on TEM studies. In tropical and subtropical regions, the E horizon generally shows no evidence of clay illuviation features (Gerasimova, 2003). However, examples studied in Chad (Bocquier, 1973) and Burkina Faso (Boulet, 1974) do show the presence of illuvial clay coatings accompanied by iron oxides in the E horizon, where they are juxtaposed on depletion features.

Sandy E horizons with coarse monic c/f-related distribution pattern contain mineral grains or rock fragments without coatings, but local occurrences of thin rims of oriented fine material have been reported (Kuhn, 2003a).

In frost-affected soils, including soils affected by frost action in the past, the lower part of E horizons and E/Bt horizons are commonly observed to contain silt-clay cappings on coarse grains and Bt streaks (Kühn, 2003b). These cappings are attributed to freezing and thawing (see Van Vliet-Lanöe, 2010; Van Vliet-Lanoë & Fox, 2018). Bt streaks ('Schmitze' after Murawski, 1998) differ in composition from the surrounding material and have b-fabrics and other characteristics similar to those of the underlying Bt or Btb horizons. The formation of Bt streaks is attributed to uprooting (e.g., Schaetzl et al., 1990), to bioturbation (e.g., Gabet et al., 2003), to the further development of E into Bt horizons (Bullock, 1968; Bullock et al., 1974) or to lateral, vertical and/or horizontal transport (Pawluk & Bal, 1985). Despite micromorphological investigations, fine material cappings have not been described in E horizons from loamy to clayey sediments in temperate regions (e.g., Stephan, 1981, 1993; Miedema, 1987) or in tropical/subtropical environments (Nettleton et al., 1989).

The combined occurrence of lenticular microstructure and undisturbed, mostly limpid clay coatings in eluvial horizons indicates former ice segregation processes followed by clay illuviation; otherwise the clay coatings would have been fragmented or destroyed (Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1988; Kuhn, 2003a). The presence of fragments of limpid clay coatings within lenticular plates in E/Bt horizons implies that clay illuviation has preceded ice segregation (Kuhn, 2003b). Three different micromorphological types (eluvial platy, eluvial platy-differentiated and eluvial simple apedal nodular) were proposed by Gerasimova (2003) for loamy E horizons, each with specific micromorphological properties.

With increasing depth in transitional horizons that show tonguing and/or an irregular lower boundary, Bt streaks (from mm to several cm in diameter) occur with small in situ limpid clay coatings and, less commonly, fragments of clay coatings (Fig. 15) (Miedema et al., 1999; Kuhn, 2003b; Kuhn et al., 2006a). The transitional horizons can also include silt and sand infillings that sometimes exhibit reverse grading indicating former periglacial influence (see Van Vliet-Lanoë, 2010; Van Vliet-Lanoë & Fox, 2018).

FIGURE 15 Fragments of yellow-brown clay coatings (red arrows) in Bt streaks of a Bt/E horizon.

Degradation features such as reorientation phenomena of clay coatings (FitzPatrick, 1993) and incorporation of fragments of clay coatings into the groundmass are often found in E, Bt/E and E/Bt horizons (Bullock, 1968; Payton, 1993; Gerasimova et al., 1996; Bronnikova et al., 2000). These features may indicate a destruction of the upper part of Bt horizons (Bullock, 1968) or changes in the palaeoenvironment, also in the case of Bt formation in layered parent material (Kuhn et al., 2006a).

# 5. Quantification of Clay Illuviation

The quantitative micromorphological criteria proposed for the classification of argillic horizons was first  $10\%$  or more of oriented clays in thin sections (Soil Survey Staff, 1960). The limit has been lowered in later issues of Soil Taxonomy and is now  $1\%$  (Soil Survey Staff, 2014).

McKeague et al. (1981) evaluated criteria for argillic horizons in Canadian soils using semiquantitative counts of illuvial clay and found that only 32 of the 54 horizons designated Bt in the field had at least  $1\%$  apparently illuvial clay. This could be due to the fact that (i) Bt horizons were identified in the field by increased clay content rather than the presence of illuvial clay coatings, (ii) pressure surfaces were confused with illuvial clay coatings, or (iii) as discussed below, that the microscopic estimation was incorrect.

Quantitative studies of clay illuviation generally involve volume determinations for the clay coatings, using thin sections (Brewer, 1968). Another approach is the estimation of gains and losses in clay during soil formation and evolution, on the basis of stable mineral contents in the different horizons of the profile (Smeck & Wilding, 1980) or on the basis of the current clay contents and the thickness of the horizons under the hypothesis of a constant soil volume (Van Wambeke, 1972, 1974).

Point counting has been the most frequently used technique to quantify illuvial clay in thin sections (e.g., Brewer, 1968; Eswaran, 1968; Miedema & Slager, 1972; McKeague et al., 1978, 1980; McKeague, 1983; Murphy & Kemp, 1984). However, the reproducibility of results has been questioned because different trained operators obtained different results on the same samples, with a coefficient of variance of up to  $50\%$  (McKeague et al., 1980, Murphy, 1983, Miedema, 2002). This could be explained by difficulties in identifying illuvial clay, neoformed clay resulting from weathering (e.g., Mermut & Pape, 1973; Magaldi & Tallini, 2000) and porostriated b-fabrics or stress deformed illuvial clay coatings. Repeated counting by the same operator using one set of interpretative rules leads to much more consistent counting results (McKeague et al., 1980). It should also be taken into account that the amount of micromorphologically detected illuvial clay is usually not in linear relationship with the gravimetric clay content (Schlichting & Blume, 1961; Murphy & Kemp, 1984).

With the development of image analysis techniques in the last decades, new methods became available for the quantification of micromorphological features. Some attempts have been made to quantify clay coatings in thin sections using multilayer digital image processing (Terribile & FitzPatrick, 1992, 1995).

Based on counts of illuvial features in thin sections, some indices have been developed (Table 2), such as the degree of illuviation, the degree of reworking and the profile clay illuviation index (Miedema & Slager, 1972). The degree of clay illuviation corresponds to the area (volume) occupied by all illuvial features (both in situ and reworked) and expressed as a percentage of the total volume of the thin section. The degree of reworking is the ratio between the volume of fragmented and deformed illuviation features and that of all illuvial features. The profile illuviation index is the sum of the products of the percentage of illuvial clay in each horizon and the thickness of the horizon in centimetres.

These indices have been used in various micromorphometric studies of argillic horizons in Late Glacial deposits in Europe (Miedema et al., 1978, 1983, 1999; Schwan et al., 1982; Miedema, 1987; Feijtel et al., 1988; Jongmans et al., 1991) and South America (Pazos & Stoops, 1987). The highest degree of illuviation values recorded for subhorizons of the argillic horizon were  $6.2\% - 19.9\%$ . These values are consistent with the typical range of illuvial clay ( $1\% - 20\%$ ) in thin sections of argillic horizons as mentioned by Murphy and Kemp (1987). The degree of reworking ranged from more than  $70\%$  in well-drained soils to less than  $25\%$  in imperfectly drained soils, indicating that biological activity is strongly related with the drainage conditions. In a study of zonal Mollisols, a greater abundance and thickness of illuvial clay coatings was measured for soils with calcite-cemented subsurface horizons than for soils lacking such interval (Pazos, 1984).

To evaluate the degree of soil development, some indices were developed that include the degree of clay illuviation (Harden, 1982, Ferrari & Magaldi, 1983; Dorronsoro, 1994). The Micromorphological Soil Development Index (MISODI; Magaldi & Tallini, 2000) was defined on basis of the size and the frequency of occurrence of both illuvial and authigenic clay coatings in thin sections. The study of a chronosequence of relicts of palaeosols has shown a good relationship between the proposed relative age of the palaeosols and the degree of weathering and pedogenesis in the B and B/C horizons as indicated by the MISODI (Magaldi & Tallini, 2000). Khormali et al. (2003) suggested a modified MISODI that they named MISECA (Micromorphological Index of Soil Evolution in highly Calcareous Arid to Semiarid Conditions). The authors tested MISECA in soils from Iran and found that it could be used for relative dating of argillic horizons when soil-forming factors have been uniform during the entire period of soil development.

# 6. Conclusions

The correct recognition and description of clay coatings is the key to a precise interpretation of genesis and properties of the horizons and soils under consideration. Illuvial clay coatings are often difficult to recognise in the field, but in most cases they are easily distinguishable under the microscope. So far, micromorphology is the only reliable method to validate clay illuviation, and it also provides additional information about the conditions of formation of the various textural illuvial features.

Many field and laboratory experiments were carried out with the aim of investigating the genesis and formation of clay coatings. Nevertheless, it is hardly possible to infer from micromorphological data alone if the illuvial clay is a result of (i) vertical translocation from the overlying horizon, (ii) lateral translocation, or (iii) translocation processes within the same horizon. The combination of micromorphological studies with laser ablation ICP-MS, FTIR, XRF and SEM along the horizons may reveal more information about the source of the clay within specific horizons.

# 1. Introduction

Redoximorphic features form in water-saturated and reduced soils. They can be identified by their distinctive colour patterns and are usually visible to the naked eye. Many terms have been used to describe redoximorphic features, including mottles, red mottles, grey mottles, gley spots, iron concretions, iron nodules, plinthite, iron stone, gley mottles and gley, to name just a few (e.g., Schlichting & Schwertmann,

1973; Stoops & Eswaran, 1985; Bouma et al., 1990; Veneman et al., 1998). The term 'mottle' is used by some authors to describe any feature that has a colour different from that of the surrounding soil matrix (e.g., Schoeneberger et al., 2012). Redoximorphic features are a specific subset of mottles. Soil scientists define redoximorphic features as those formed by the reduction, translocation and oxidation of iron and manganese compounds in the soil after water saturation and desaturation, respectively (Soil Science Society of America, 2001; Vepraskas, 2015). Schoeneberger et al. (2012) provide a flow chart to determine whether or not a feature is redoximorphic. This flow chart, although designed for field descriptions, can also be used in thin section studies.

The terminology used to describe redoximorphic features in thin sections is derived from sedimentary petrology and soil micromorphology (Brewer, 1976; Blatt, 1982; Bullock et al., 1985; FitzPatrick, 1993). Although these studies focus on viewing the features with the microscope, it is important to note that these features are also visible in hand samples. Many soil scientists unfamiliar with micromorphology are familiar with redoximorphic features and their interpretation.

The relevance of these features has increased over the last 20 to 30 years from being used primarily to understand soil genesis and palaeoenvironments (Veneman et al., 1976; Bullock et al., 1985; Vepraskas et al., 1994; Kemp, 1999; Vepraskas, 2015) to being used in the regulation of land-use issues related to waterlogged soils and wetlands. For example, these features are used to determine the depth to seasonal water saturation for onsite wastewater-system design in many jurisdictions within the United States (Lindbo et al., 2004). They are also used in the identification and delineation of hydric soils found in wetlands in the United States (USDA-NRCS, 2010). The formation of these features is explained in a monograph by Vepraskas (2015).

Although this book is focused on micromorphological interpretations, there is considerable overlap between redoximorphic features seen in thin section and those observed in the field. Soil micromorphological investigations must be considered with regard to the whole profile (Wilding & Drees, 1983). Accordingly, features in both hand sample and thin section will be discussed. Most detailed investigations begin by examining the soil with the naked eye, progress to hand lenses and eventually to microscopic evaluation. Since redoximorphic features are related to environmental conditions, some measurements of environmental conditions (e.g., water table levels and redox potentials) are critical to the interpretation of modern redoximorphic features. Once current environmental conditions related to redoximorphic feature formation are established, redoximorphic features in palaeosols can be used to elucidate its palaeo-environmental context.

# 2. General Genetic Aspects

Redoximorphic features form from the reduction, translocation and oxidation of Fe and Mn. An understanding of Fe and Mn chemistry is essential in the interpretation of

redoximorphic features. In viewing a soil with the naked eye or a hand lens, the colours that are seen are due to oxide coatings (or lack of coatings) on mineral grains and/or impregnation of the groundmass. This is evident when the soil is viewed in thin section. In general, red, brown and yellow colours are due to Fe oxide coatings, dark purplish black colours are due to Mn oxides, and dull black colours are due to organic matter. More specifically in PPL, goethite and lepidocrocite are yellow, hematite is red and Mn oxides are black. If soil particles are uncoated they will often appear grey, white or the colour of the uncoated mineral grain.

Fe and Mn oxides are removed from particles if they are chemically reduced in the soil. This occurs under certain specific conditions: (i) saturation with stagnant, oxygen-depleted (anaerobic) water; (ii) presence of sufficient organic matter and microorganisms; and (iii) soil temperatures above biological zero  $(5^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$  to allow biological activity (Vepraskas, 2015; Vepraskas et al., 2016).

As microorganisms decompose organic matter, electrons are transferred from the organic material to another compound or element that is called an electron acceptor (Megonigal et al., 1993). The electron acceptors are reduced in a well-defined order (Stumm & Morgan, 1981). Oxygen  $(\mathrm{O}_2)$  is reduced first. Once the oxygen has been depleted (anaerobic conditions), nitrate  $(\mathrm{NO}_3^-)$  in solution is reduced to nitrogen gas  $(\mathrm{N}_2)$ . These first two reactions leave no morphological signature in the soil. The reduction of Mn  $(\mathrm{Mn}^{4+}$  or  $\mathrm{Mn}^{3+}$  to  $\mathrm{Mn}^{2+})$  occurs next followed by reduction of Fe  $(\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$  to  $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+})$ . The reduced forms of these elements being highly soluble, the Fe/Mn oxides dissolve off the soil particles. As the oxide coatings are removed, the underlying mineral grain colour becomes visible, the soil typically becomes grey and redox depletion features develop. If anaerobic conditions persist, sulphate  $(\mathrm{SO}_4^{2-})$  is next reduced to hydrogen sulphide  $(\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{S})$ . Finally, carbon dioxide  $(\mathrm{CO}_2)$  is reduced to methane  $(\mathrm{CH}_4)$ .

A result of Fe and Mn reduction is the destabilisation of clay particles because these oxides act as cementing agents. If the oxide coating on clay particles dissolves through reduction, clay particles are more easily dispersed in subsequent water saturation events (Brinkman, 1970; Brinkman et al., 1973; Morras, 1983) and can be translocated. This process has been used in part to describe the degradation of clay (Aurousseau, 1990) and argillic or fragipan horizons (Brinkman et al., 1973; Bullock et al., 1974; Ransom et al., 1987; Lindbo et al., 2000) and the formation of E horizons (Tselishcheva, 1972; Morras, 1983). If, on the other hand, the soil has sufficient buffering capacity, this process may not occur (Van Ranst & De Coninck, 2002; Boixadera et al., 2003).

As reduced Fe and Mn in solution move into oxidising environments, Fe will oxidise and precipitate from the soil solution before Mn (i.e., at a lower Eh) (e.g., Hseu & Chen, 1996; Kyuma, 2004). Even within a predominantly anaerobic soil, aerobic conditions occur wherever there are air-filled channels, entrapped air in intrapedal voids or aerobic water within peds which lacked sufficient organic matter to cause reducing conditions to occur. In these areas, the reduced elements oxidise and accumulate on the soil particles or ped surfaces (Callame & Dupuis, 1972; Vepraskas et al., 1974; Evans & Franzmeier, 1986; Stolt et al., 1994; Vepraskas & Vaughn, 2016).

# 3. Nature and Identification

The specific terminology of redoximorphic features depends on whether one is viewing a thin section under the microscope or a hand sample in the field (Table 1). In thin sections, redoximorphic features can be categorised into three groups: intrusive redox pedofeatures, impregnative redox pedofeatures and depletion redox pedofeatures (Figs. 1 to 4) (Stoops, 2003). Hand samples fall into three distinct groups: redox depletions, redox concentrations and reduced matrices (Vepraskas, 2015).

# 3.1 Intrusive Redox Pedofeatures

Intrusive redox pedofeatures are zones where oxidised Fe and/or Mn have accumulated as coatings or infillings in a void or as coatings on a grain or aggregate, due to changes in the oxidation state of the element (Fig. 2). These features were called mangans and ferrans in older literature (Brewer, 1976).

The identification of minerals present is done in part by colour (in reflected and transmitted plain polarised light). However, colour alone is not enough to identify Fe and Mn oxide minerals as a small amount of Mn can greatly darken a feature (e.g., Rhoton et al., 1993). Therefore, other means such as X-ray diffraction and SEM-EDS analyses may be necessary to confirm visual observations.

# 3.2 Impregnative Redox Pedofeatures

Impregnative redox pedofeatures are zones where oxidised Fe and/or Mn have accumulated in the matrix as nodules or as Fe/Mn oxide hypo- or quasicoatings along voids

or coarse mineral grains (Stoops, 2003) (Table 1; Fig. 3A to C), due to changes in the oxidation state of the element. In older literature (before the mid-1980s), they have been referred to as reddish or rusty mottles, neoferrans and quasiferrans, and neomangans (Brewer, 1976). Their colour in PPL is dependent on Fe and Mn oxide mineralogy and on the amount of oxides present (Rhoton et al., 1993). If the pedofeatures are dominated by Fe oxides, they have a higher chroma (i.e., appear more reddish, yellowish or brownish) than the adjacent groundmass. Typical Fe oxide minerals in these concentrations are goethite, ferrihydrite and lepidocrocite (Schwertmann & Taylor, 1989). If Mn oxides are present in the features, they have a lower value and chroma (appear darker or black) than the groundmass. Commonly hypocoatings will appear denser on the side proximal

to the natural surface and will have a diffuse boundary on their distal side. They may appear denser (darker, opaque) throughout when the oxides completely coat smaller grains. An Fe-rich mineral grain affected by weathering may be surrounded by an Fe oxide hypocoating (Fig. 3C), but this would not be interpreted as an Fe redox pedofeature as key processes for their formation were not involved (reduction-oxidation related to water saturation and reduction).

Nodules (Fig. 3D and E) have been described in the literature using a number of terms including concretions, masses, glaebules and mottles (Brewer, 1976; Vepraskas et al., 1994; D'Amore et al., 2004; Vepraskas, 2015). In thin section descriptions, these terms, particularly 'concretions', have not been recommended for use (Bullock et al., 1985). These pedofeatures are orthic, disorthic or anorthic and can be further described based on their internal fabric, external morphology and boundaries (Stoops, 2003). Any coatings related to the nodule should be described for correct interpretation of these features (Tucker et al., 1994; D'Amore et al., 2004). For example a nodule coated by clay may no longer be actively forming.

# 3.3 Depletion Redox Pedofeatures

Depletion redox pedofeatures are zones where Fe/Mn oxides and/or clay have been removed, due to the reduction of Fe/Mn and subsequent mobilisation of these elements (Fe oxide depletions or Mn oxide depletions) (Fig. 4A and B), or are associated with the loss of clay (clay depletions) (Fig. 4C) (Schoeneberger et al., 2012; Vepraskas, 2015). All are identified in part by a grey colouration having a low chroma (less than 2, with a value of 4 or more).

Fe/Mn oxide depletions are the most common of the redox depletion pedofeatures. Such features have been referred to as albans, neoalbans, eluvian bodies, grey or gley mottles, depletions, wetness mottles (Daniels et al., 1968; Brewer, 1976; Veneman et al..

These features most often occur adjacent to voids and are described as depletion hypocoatings (Stoops, 2003). They often occur in association with Fe or Mn oxide quasicoatings (Veneman et al., 1976; Bouma et al., 1990; Vepraskas et al., 1994;

Vepraskas, 2015). Fe/Mn oxide depletion hypocoatings have a porphyric c/f-related distribution pattern and an undifferentiated, stipple-speckled or unistrial b-fabric (Stoops & Eswaran, 1985; Hseu & Chen, 1999; Hseu et al., 1999). James et al. (1995) indicated that the fabric of the depletion feature is similar to that of the unaffected matrix and/or associated Fe oxide quasicoatings.

Clay depletions have been referred to as albic neoskeletans (Vepraskas & Wilding, 1983). These are zones where, besides Fe/Mn oxides, clay is removed as well. Clay depletions have a low chroma and are often related to pores in which case they are described as clay depletion hypocoatings. Unlike Fe oxide depletions, clay depletion features have a fabric that is different from that of the groundmass, because clay has been stripped from the zone (Figs. 1 and 4C). Clay depletion hypocoatings appear to have a better expressed stippled speckled b-fabric as compared to the groundmass (Brinkman et al., 1973; Bouma et al., 1990; Nettleton et al., 1994). Differentiation between

clay depletion hypocoatings and coatings of illuvial coarse material can be difficult and may require investigation of thin sections of the full profile. One possible way to differentiate them is to look closely at any remaining clay in or adjacent to the clay depletion hypocasting. If this clay is highly oriented, the clay, and by default the coarser material, has moved by leaching and illuviation (Van Ranst & De Coninck, 2002; Boixadera et al., 2003). If the size and mineralogy of the coarse grains in the pedofeature are similar to that of the adjacent groundmass, then it is likely that the pedofeature is formed by clay depletion rather than as an illuvial accumulation of coarse material (Lindbo & Veneman, 1993; Payton, 1993b; Ajmone-Marsan et al., 1994; Boixadera et al., 2003). The presence of layering within a coarse-textured coating indicates that the feature is illuvial. A final approach that can assist in identification of clay depletion is to look deeper in the profile for the presence of eluviated clay (Vepraskas, 2015).

# 3.4 Quantification

Some land-use assessments are based on estimates of the percentage of redoximorphic features found in a given soil horizon (USDA-NRCS, 2010). The percentage of redox- morphic features in wetland soils, for example, has been related to the frequency and duration of saturation (He et al., 2003), which are expensive and time-consuming to measure. Estimates of percentages should be made on a 'representative elementary area' (REA) which is the smallest area that can be used to get a consistent estimate of a given feature, such as total porosity (VandenBygaard & Protz, 1999). Estimates of areal percentage for a feature in a sample should remain constant for cross-sectional areas larger than the REA. Estimates made on areas smaller than the REA will change and will not represent field conditions.

REA increases with the size of the features being described (VandenBygaard & Protz, 1999). O'Donnell et al. (2011) estimated that the REA needed to describe redoximorphic features is approximately  $50~\mathrm{cm}^2$  for impregnative redox pedofeatures ('redox concentrations') in horizons for which field estimates of redox feature abundance are lower than  $2\%$ . This REA will probably vary among soil types. Where the thin section area is less than the REA, observations should be made on multiple thin sections until the REA is equalled or exceeded. REA can be best determined using digital imaging equipment (O'Donnell et al., 2010). Alternatively, abundance estimates can be made in the field on areas larger than the REA, and those values can be used in conjunction with thin section analysis where needed.

# 4. Significance

The type and location of redox pedofeatures within the soil profile are used to interpret the degree of water saturation (Table 2) (Veneman et al., 1976; Vepraskas & Bouma, 1976; Richardson & Hole, 1979; Stoops & Eswaran, 1985; Bouma et al., 1990; PiPujol & Buurman, 1994; Vepraskas et al., 1994; Hseu & Chen, 2001; Vepraskas, 2015).

of redox pedofeatures varies depending on the movement of water and air through the soil, the duration of water saturation and anaerobic conditions, and the presence or absence of organic matter.

# 4.1 Duration of Water Saturation

Short duration of water saturation or rapid fluctuation of water table levels results in intrapedal Fe/Mn oxide nodules and hypocoatings (Schwertmann & Fanning, 1976; Richardson & Hole, 1979; Arshad & St. Arnaud, 1980). At microsites where organic matter is present, the dissolved oxygen will be consumed rapidly by organic matter decomposing microorganisms when soil temperatures are above  $5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . This eventually leads first to the reduction of Mn and then to the reduction of Fe. If reduced Mn and Fe diffuse into the ped interior where carbon is not present and some dissolved oxygen remains in the water, they will oxidise to form an intrapedal impregnative nodule (Bouma et al., 1990; Tucker et al., 1994). If the soil contains enough Mn, then Mn nodules occur higher in the profile (closer to the surface) than Fe oxide nodules due to the difference in redox potential required for precipitation from solution (Veneman et al., 1976; Stoops & Eswaran, 1985).

If only Mn nodules are present the duration of water saturation has been estimated to be 2 to 3 days (Veneman et al., 1976), but the actual duration may vary among soils depending on the soil organic C content and soil temperature. If the duration of water saturation is long enough to reduce Fe and Mn, then hypocoatings made of these oxides can be observed. Nodules may still be present but the amount of Mn in the pedofeatures tends to be lower (Veneman et al., 1976; Stoops & Eswaran, 1985). This duration of water

saturation is often not long enough to produce redox depletion hypocoatings (Richardson & Hole, 1979; Murphy, 1984; Bouma et al., 1990). As duration of water saturation increases and the soil becomes reduced for longer periods, goethite and lepidocrocite predominate in the redoximorphic features (Arocena et al., 1994; PiPujol & Buurman, 1997). In more oxidising and warmer environments, the Fe in redox pedofeatures tends to be dominated by hematite and goethite (Arocena et al., 1994).

The formation of concentric nodules occurs over multiple wet/dry cycles or fluctuations in the water table (Morras, 1983; Bouma et al., 1990; D'Amore et al., 2004). The Fe and Mn oxides present in the layers of the concentric nodules can be used to determine changes in the environment in which each layer formed (Menning & Shoba, 1980; Landuydt, 1990; White & Dixon, 1996; Liu et al., 2002).

As the duration of water saturation increases to a few weeks, the type and pattern of redox pedofeature changes from only impregnative to both impregnative and depletion-related pedofeatures (Veneman et al., 1976; Stoops & Eswaran, 1985; Bouma et al., 1990; He et al., 2003). The increased duration of water saturation results in longer periods of reduction in areas adjacent to a source of organic carbon. In these zones, redox depletion hypoc coatings are formed. The reduced Fe and Mn may diffuse into the ped where they oxidise to form Fe/Mn redox quasicoatings.

Intrapedal nodules become smoother and less abundant as the duration of water saturation increases (D'Amore et al., 2004). Manganese remains reduced longer than Fe and may be leached deeper into the profile (Stoops & Eswaran, 1985; Kyuma, 2004). Clay depletion hypocoatings can also occur. They are most often associated with root channels or large voids containing organic material such as decaying roots (Payton, 1993b; Vepraskas et al., 1994). High concentrations of base cations in the soil may limit the formation of clay depletion hypococoatings (Boixadera et al., 2003).

The patterns of features associated with short and medium duration of water saturation have been related mostly to surface water gley (Murphy, 1984; PiPujol & Buurman, 1994) but also to episaturated horizons and the zone of greatest water table fluctuation in endosaturated soils (Vepraskas et al., 1994; Boixadera et al., 2003).

Under long duration (many weeks to months) of water saturation and reduction, Fe oxide depletion pedofeatures occupy the entire groundmass (Bouma et al., 1990; Vepraskas, 2015). The Fe oxide-depleted groundmass appears greyer or lighter in colour as compared to the groundmass of soils profiles or horizons where water saturation occurs for a short to medium duration. Several researchers noted that the fine material in an Fe oxide-depleted pedofeature and/or groundmass has a more speckled appearance (grainy limpidity), which they explained by 'ferrolysis' leading to the destruction of some clay minerals (Brinkman, 1970, 1977; Brinkman et al., 1973; Brammer & Brinkman, 1977; Murphy, 1984; Payton 1993a, 1993b; Hseu et al., 1999; Zhang & Gong, 2003; Kyuma, 2004). However, this process has been questioned by Van Ranst and De Coninck (2002).

If conditions are such that  $\mathrm{SO}_4^{2-}$  is reduced in the presence of reduced Fe, pyrite may form (Slager et al., 1970; Stoops & Eswaran, 1985; see also Mees & Stoops, 2010, 2018) indicating extremely reduced conditions. If the pore water is saline then barite may

form, and if carbonates are present siderite may result (Stoops & Eswaran, 1985; PiPujol & Buurman, 1997; McMillan & Schwertmann, 1998).

When these saturated horizons are drained, the macropores will fill with air first while the pores in the soil matrix remain filled with water. Reduced Fe in the soil matrix adjacent to the macropores diffuses toward areas of lower concentrations of dissolved Fe that are found along the air-filled pores, where it oxidises and precipitates to form Fe oxide coatings and hypocoatings (Callame & Dupuis, 1972; Veneman et al., 1976; Evans & Franzmeier, 1986; Bouma et al., 1990; Lindbo & Veneman, 1993; Stolt et al., 1994). The resulting pattern is one of grey ped interiors with Fe oxide hypocoatings and coatings along voids and ped faces (Vepraskas et al., 1974; Veneman et al., 1976; Vepraskas & Bouma, 1976; Bouma et al., 1990; Kemp et al., 1998). This pattern representing long duration of water saturation has been related to ground water gley (Murphy, 1984; Stoops & Eswaran, 1985) as well as to endosaturation (Vepraskas et al., 1994; Vepraskas, 2015).

Assuming that the organic matter content is sufficient to promote Fe reduction and that the groundmass contains at least  $3\%$  free iron, Vepraskas and Guertal (1992) developed a nomograph to quantitatively assess the time required for the formation of a  $2\mathrm{mm}$  thick Fe oxide depletion hypocoating, relating the length of time during which  $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$  is in solution (i.e., the amount of time the soil is saturated) to the concentration of  $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$  in solution. Thus, data on carbon content, Fe content and duration of water saturation are necessary to fully estimate the time required for a feature to form. Furthermore, as the amount of depletion (size and percentage) increases, both the duration and the frequency of water saturation increase (He et al., 2003; Morgan & Stolt, 2006; Severson et al., 2008).

# 4.2 Special Cases

# 4.2.1 Stratified Soils

Stratified soils, specifically where a layer with fine texture overlies a layer with coarse texture, exhibit redoximorphic patterns that do not completely agree with the patterns discussed in the previous section. In these soils, the fine-textured layer may have a high water content with the pores in the soil matrix being filled with water and reduced, but the macropores along ped faces and channels may remain air-filled. This leads to the formation of an (intrapedal) Fe-depleted groundmass and Fe depletion hypocoatings along ped faces or around channels (Vepraskas et al., 1974; Veneman et al., 1976; Clothier et al., 1978; Morgan & Stolt, 2006). The underlying coarser material may be devoid of redoximorphic features (Clothier et al., 1978). If this pattern occurred in a groundwater gley (reduced groundmass), the underlying horizon also would show redoximorphic features (Vepraskas, 2015).

# 4.2.2 Paddy Soils

Anthrosaturation (human controlled) occurs as soil is intentionally flooded and ponded for agronomic reasons. Most often this occurs in the cultivation of rice (paddy soils). The

long duration of water saturation and reduction, coupled with the agronomic practices, result in a distinctive pattern of redoximorphic features (Table 2) (Hseu & Chen, 1996, 1999; Zhang & Gong, 2003; Kyuma, 2004). In these soils, which are both saturated and reduced  $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$  present in pore water) and where actively respiration plant roots bring oxygen into the rooting zone, iron coatings and hypocoatings are formed along channel walls associated with living roots (oxidised rhizospheres; USDA-NRCS, 2010) (Chen et al., 1980; Xu & Zhu, 1983), by diffusion of reduced Fe toward the actively respiration root where dissolved  $\mathrm{O}_2$  is available. If reduced Mn is present, it will oxidise in a less-reducing zone, often closer to the living root or on the proximal edge of the coating. Translocation of reduced Mn deeper into the soil results in the occurrence of Mn nodules and hypocoatings at the interface between the saturated zone of the paddy soil and the underlying unsaturated soil (Kyuma, 2004). Nodules are also more common as the depth to the saturated/unsaturated soil interface increases and where the water saturation has the greatest fluctuations (Hseu & Chen, 2001; Kyuma, 2004). The shape of nodules seems to be affected by cultivation, as they can be broken and disrupted physically (Hseu & Chen, 2001). The Fe oxide-depleted groundmass of paddy soils is similar in appearance to the groundmass in groundwater gley soils (Hseu et al., 1999; Zhang & Gong, 2003; Kyuma, 2004).

# 4.2.3 Bog Iron

'Bog iron' is a large-scale redoximorphic feature observed in areas where groundwater rich in reduced Fe moves to a more oxidising environment (Stoops, 1983; Landuydt, 1990; Curmi et al., 1994a, 1994b; Kaczorek & Sommer, 2003). Bog iron is highly porous and composed of different intervals, which have formed due to contrasting microenvironmental conditions, such as changes in redox status (Stoops, 1983; Landuydt, 1990). In some alluvial environments, the upper interval can be a layer composed predominately of clay and diatoms (Stoops, 1983). The next interval contains optically isotropic Fe oxides and zones of banded radiating acicular goethite needles on void walls and ferrihydrite nodules (Landuydt, 1990). It has been assumed that the upper intervals are periodically oxidised zones. The next layer is dominated by minerals such as vivianite and siderite and assumed to be predominantly reduced. Siderite is often observed as coatings on root channels as well as discrete crystals and spherulites (Stoops, 1983; Landuydt, 1990). Vivianite also occurs as coatings on voids and may be associated with decaying roots in channels (see Karkanas & Goldberg, 2010, 2018). The lowest interval may occasionally contain discrete pyrite framboids. Landuydt (1990) observed that within each major zone some microzonation (both vertical and horizontal) of ferriciferous mineralogy can be observed, representing fluctuating redox conditions.

# 4.2.4 Dark Parent Material

In soils derived from dark parent materials (value 4 or less, chroma 2 or less), redox- morphic features may be difficult if not impossible to recognise in the field. Fe oxide depletion pedofeatures (hypocoatings) were observed in thin sections of soils on dark

carboniferous glacial till (Stolt et al., 2001). These observations coupled with water table data confirm both water saturation and reduction at the site. Similarly, soils derived from high chroma Fe-rich parent materials may not show the typical low chroma depletion features (chroma 2 or less). However, thin section analysis revealed depletion hypo-coatings where Fe had indeed been reduced and translocated (Elles & Rabenhorst, 1994).

# 4.3 Relict Versus Contemporary Features

Relict redoximorphic features are those that have stopped forming in the soil horizon in which they now occur or in some cases were inherited from the parent material. They are of interest because their presence is good evidence that the soil's hydrology has changed from the time the features first formed. In most cases, soils with relict redoximorphic features should be drier and more oxidised than when the features initially developed. The redoximorphic features most likely to be relict are Fe/Mn nodules. When these features are hard, they are very resistant to being broken down and mixed into the groundmass. Most other redoximorphic features are friable and therefore more likely to be destroyed.

Separating relict features from contemporary ones that are still forming in present time is often problematic. Combining micromorphological observations with data on current hydrology, such as records of water table fluctuation, can aid in determining whether features are contemporary or not (Tucker et al., 1994; Greenberg & Wilding, 1998; D'Amore et al., 2004). Conversely, relict features can be used as a less expensive but also a less reliable way to assess current hydrology.

A further question that can be addressed by micromorphological investigation is whether the feature is actively forming or degrading (Vepraskas & Wilding, 1983; Kemp et al., 1998).

The nature of the boundaries of redoximorphic features, nodules in particular, have been the focus of several investigations that have studied relict redoximorphic features. The presence of a diffuse boundary of a nodule is often considered to be indicative of contemporary development (Suddhiprakarn & Kheoruenromne, 1994; Tucker et al., 1994; Costantini and Priori, 2007). A sharp boundary suggests the feature is no longer forming (Tucker et al., 1994). This does not always mean the nodule did not form in situ (Stolt et al., 1994; Lindbo et al., 2000; D'Amore et al., 2004). Stolt et al. (1994) found that certain nodules having abrupt boundaries may form in place if there are isolated areas of contrasting particle size within a horizon.

The roundness or sphericity of the nodules may also be used. Rounded orthic nodules have been considered to reflect current hydrology, especially if drainage is restricted (Schwertmann & Fanning, 1976; Richardson & Hole, 1979; Elles & Rabenhorst, 1994; Elles et al., 1996). However, McCarthy et al. (1998) consider rounded nodules as being transported and not formed in situ. Nodules that are degrading will often have sand or silt grains protruding from their boundaries and will have irregular digitate or mammillate shapes (Tucker et al., 1994). They may also have Fe oxide depletion hypocoatings

along their sides (Mücher & Coventry, 1994). Tucker et al. (1994) indicated that the more pronounced the degradation of the nodules, the greater the degree of water saturation.

The occurrence of Fe oxide hypocoatings and nodules in the same horizon (Greenberg & Wilding, 1998) and the presence of mycelia or fungal hyphae around an Fe oxide nodule (Zauyah & Bisdom, 1983) have also been used to suggest that the feature is contemporary.

If the redoximorphic feature is related to current structural voids, it is likely to be pedogenic in origin and formed in situ but not necessarily currently forming (Tucker et al., 1994; Wagner & Rabenhorst, 1994; Greenberg & Wilding, 1998; Lindbo et al., 2000). If the redoximorphic features are coated with illuvial clay but still related to the structural voids then they are most likely not contemporary (Vepraskas & Wilding, 1983; Tucker et al., 1994). On the other hand, if there are associated clay depletion hypo-coatings, as well as nodules with irregular boundaries or features with diffuse boundaries, the redoximorphic features are more likely to be contemporary.

All types of features (contemporary, relict, in situ or inherited) may be found in the same horizon (Tucker et al., 1994; Busacca & Cremaschi, 1998; Muggler et al., 2001). In this case, the presence of contemporary features suggests some features are related to current hydrology. In the end, the deduced sequence of formation of the features may be used to understand the stages of pedogenesis in the profile (Bullock et al., 1974; Richardson & Hole, 1979; Lindbo et al., 2000; D'Amore et al., 2004).

Redoximorphic features in palaeosols may help determine the climatic conditions during soil formation. However, these features are not completely static or stable. Several investigations have examined diagenetic changes in mineralogy associated with palaeosols (McCarthy et al., 1998; Kemp, 1999; Reolid et al., 2008). Still other investigations have used changes in mineralogy to look at how the reducing environment and therefore drainage changed after the formation of a given feature (McCarthy & Plint, 1998; Choi, 2005). In both of these studies a more reducing environment was determined based on the presence of spherulitic siderite. Despite changes in mineralogy, the type of features appears to remain unchanged, so interpretation based on the morphology of a feature rather than on its mineralogical composition is valid (McCarthy et al., 1998).

# 5. Conclusions

Redoximorphic features are common in most soils where water saturation occurs and their presence is used extensively in making land use decisions. Although redoximorphic features are visible in the field with both the naked eye and a hand lens, micromorphological analysis can further enhance our understanding of how these features form and how to interpret them correctly. These interpretations are best made when supportive information such as water table and climatic data are available (Bouma et al., 1990; Vepraskas, 2015), but they can to a large extent be based on extensive micromorphological data correlating redoximorphic pedofeatures to environmental conditions.

# 1. Introduction

# 1.1 Soil Fauna and Micromorphology

Soil animals pass one or more active phases of their life cycle in the soil for different reasons, such as protection, feeding and reproduction. These organisms play an important role in transporting and altering various soil components, including organic matter decomposition and soil structure formation, and they thereby influence physical and chemical processes in soils. Faunal features are found in all types of soils, and the

nature of entire soil horizons can be determined by faunal activity. There is a surprising lack of knowledge, however, on the precise functional roles played by many animals occurring in soils (Davidson et al., 2002).

Micromorphological techniques enable us (i) to distinguish between features originating from different groups of organisms and their modifications, (ii) to reconstruct the conditions under which these features were formed and the chronological order in which they developed, and (iii) to quantify the effect of different groups of soil fauna on soil (micro)structure development and organic matter dynamics.

This chapter is focused on micromorphological features resulting from soil fauna activity. Features related to other soil biota, such as microorganisms and plants, are described elsewhere in this book (e.g., Ismail-Meyer et al., 2018). Interactions between soil fauna and these other soil organisms, although frequently observed in thin sections, are beyond the scope of this chapter. Also excluded are large features resulting from the activities of soil megafauna (e.g., mice, moles), of large flying insects (e.g., wasps, bumblebees) and birds, whose study does not require a micromorphological approach.

The effects of soil fauna on soils and sediments can be multifold and complex. One group alone, e.g., earthworms, termites or mollusks (Fig. 1), can produce over 50 different types of features. In addition, many modifications of soil faunal features occur through interaction with other soil processes. This chapter aims to provide a basic

outline of the diversity of soil fauna, their activity in soils and the manner in which these affect micromorphological features in general terms. To interpret soil faunal features in thin sections, a basic understanding of the behaviour of the most important species is essential.

Until the first half of the 20th century, the knowledge of soil animals was virtually restricted to a few prominent species, such as earthworms and termites. Kubiëna (1938, 1948) described the important role of soil fauna in the decomposition of organic matter and mixing of organic and mineral soil constituents, based on micromorphological observations of excrements and other features. Starting in 1955, with a keynote publication by Kubiëna on the impact of animal activity in soils, much attention has been paid to the micromorphological aspects of soil fauna and their role in the development of humus forms and soils (e.g., Hartmann, 1965; Zachariae, 1965; Bal, 1970; Babel, 1971, 1975; De Coninck & Righi, 1983; Douglas & Thompson, 1985; Pawluk, 1987). Micromorphological studies dealing with faunal activity have been published in journals and handbooks covering a range of disciplines, including soil science, biology, forestry, chemistry and agricultural management. A selection of key publications is given in Table 1.

Since the late 1980s, the interest for sustainable land use has grown steadily and micromorphological studies of soil fauna, in combination with soil physical and chemical analyses, have been focused mostly on the effects of land use or agricultural management on the activity of soil animals and their role in soil structure development (Kooistra et al., 1985; Thompson et al., 1990; Boersma & Kooistra, 1994; Jongmans et al., 2001; Davidson et al., 2002, 2004; Pulleman et al., 2003, 2005b). Kooistra et al. (1985) studied the role of different groups of soil biota and their effects on soil physical

properties under selected management systems. They quantified the different types of void systems by image analysis, assigned them to soil fauna groups and related the results to measured soil physical properties. The data were then used to calculate soil-water regimes and land qualities in simulation models. The results also illustrated the contribution of soil fauna under different management systems to crop response (Kooistra & Boersma, 1994). An integrated approach using micromorphology and physical and chemical soil analyses has been also used by Pulleman et al. (2005b) to determine the effect of earthworms on macro- and microaggregate formation and carbon sequestration under permanent grassland and conventional arable land. This study revealed that earthworm-induced microaggregates played an important role in the stabilisation of soil carbon in permanent pasture soils but not in arable land under conventional management.

# 1.2 Diversity of the Impact of Soil Fauna on Soils

Awareness and understanding of the diversity and impact of soil fauna is crucial when identifying and interpreting micromorphological features related to soil faunal activities. Figure 2 gives an overview of the different kinds of soil organisms encountered in soils and their classification according to body diameter. Body width, rather than length, determines their impact on soil structure (Swift et al., 1979). All groups feed in essence on soil organic matter, either as primary consumers of live or dead plant materials or as

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/3f26c930-94fa-4c31-8626-99d6697f3bdc/03c5c3d67ee6fb777af175ac607e31c76be2d84a15bb6879c1f41accb25bc375.jpg)  
FIGURE 2 Main taxonomic groups of soil organisms according to body width. After Swift et al. (1979).

secondary consumers feeding on other fauna, microorganisms or their products (Brussaard & Juma, 1996). The whole set of organisms present in a certain soil environment forms a complex community in which each of the various species has its own habitat and role in the soil foodweb. Based on the kind of organic substrate they consume, several trophic groups are distinguished, e.g., detrivores, fungivores, bacterivores, phytophages, predators and omnivores (De Ruiter et al., 1993). Within one group of soil organisms, different trophic levels may be represented, for example beetle mites, mould mites and predatory mites.

Based on the impact of soil fauna on soil formation and soil structure development, a distinction is made between structure-following and structure-forming soil fauna (Kooistra et al., 1989). Structure-followers depend on the existing soil structure without being able to modify it, while structure-formers actively form or modify soil pores. Microfauna  $(< 100\mu \mathrm{m})$  rarely has a direct impact on the soil structure, but its presence attracts larger organisms (e.g., predators) that do have such an impact. Mesofauna  $(0.1 - 2\mathrm{mm})$  can be structure-following or structure-forming. Macrofauna  $(>2\mathrm{mm})$  is always structure-forming.

Soil fauna plays a major role in the decomposition of living or dead organic material of plant or animal origin. Many species also consume mineral soil material for different reasons: to enable passage through the soil, to take up the organic matter from organomineral complexes, to activate the intestines or to detoxify poisonous compounds. Different groups of soil fauna may have a very diverse diet or selectively consume specific types of tissues or particle sizes of organic and/or mineral material (Rusek, 1985; Kooistra et al., 1990; Schaefer, 2001). The ingested materials are fragmented, partly decomposed, dispersed and mixed, whereas microbes and mucus are added during passage through the intestinal tract. Ingested materials may vary throughout the year and depend on parent materials and past soil development. Consequently, the impact of specific groups of soil fauna on soils is not always well defined. Close examination of soil thin sections, combined with sampling and identification of soil animals in the field and studies of their behaviour under laboratory conditions, however, often leads to recognition of the effects of specific groups of soil fauna on soils.

Some soil animals are very mobile and transport or rearrange organic and/or inorganic soil constituents while moving from one place to another. Their impact ranges from displacement of soil materials while creating a temporary channel, as some beetles do (Brussaard, 1985), to the creation of a complex system of plastered channels and chambers, including new organomineral structures, as is common to termites (Wielemaker, 1984; Abe, 1990; Mando & Miedema, 1997; Jungerius et al., 1999; Schaefer, 2001). Consequently, soils that contain an active soil fauna population are often characterised by an intimate relationship between faunal activity and composition on the one hand and soil horizon formation on the other hand (Davidson et al., 2002).

Whole soil horizons can be bioturbated (Fig. 3) or completely depleted in fine-grained particles (Kooistra et al., 1990; Jungerius et al., 1999; Schaefer, 2001).

Interactions between different soil organisms within the same environment frequently cause modifications of faunal features. Excreta produced by one type of soil fauna can be an attractive substrate to other organisms (Fig. 4) (e.g., Pulleman et al., 2003; Davidson et al., 2004; Kooistra et al., 2006). Also faunal voids can be modified

by roots or by soil organisms other than those that created the voids (Kooistra & Brussaard, 1995).

As described below, three main categories of fauna-induced features can be distinguished in thin sections: (i) voids, (ii) excrements and other faunal products, and (iii) coatings and infillings. Besides these features, thin sections can show cross sections through whole organisms, such as worms or nematodes, and resistant remnants of soil animals, such as bones, teeth, nails, skeleton parts of centipedes or isopods, wing-sheaths of beetles, snails or mollusk shells. Remnants of soil fauna and their features do not necessarily occur at the location where they were initially deposited. Resistant remnants can accumulate in sedimentary layers (Kooistra, 1978) or may contribute substantially to prehistoric waste deposits (Van Heeringen & Theunissen, 2001).

# 2. Faunal Voids

Faunal voids are formed by consumption or removal of soil material, by exerting pressure on the soil material or by combinations of these. Three types of voids can be distinguished: (i) channels, (ii) chambers, and (iii) modified voids. Formerly, faunal voids were classified according to their diameter into micro-, meso- and macropores (Jongerius, 1957). Slager (1966) used the term biopores for all voids that are formed by organisms. The terms channels and chambers were introduced by Brewer (1964) and are still in use (e.g., Stoops, 2003). Kooistra (1982a) distinguished between primary biological voids and modified biological voids, the latter being existing voids that are subsequently modified by biological activity.

# 2.1 Channels

Channels (Fig. 5) are the most common faunal voids. They can be straight, curved or convoluted, with or without branching. Cross sections through a channel can be circular and have constant diameter (e.g., dung beetle channels) (Brussaard, 1985) or be non-circular and of variable diameter (e.g., enchymraeids channels) (Babel, 1968). Some functional groups of soil fauna, such as anecic earthworms which feed at the soil surface, produce one permanent, deep vertical channel (Fig. 6B). Other functional groups, such as endogeic earthworms, produce many more or less regular channel systems confined to the upper soil layers (Kooistra, 1982b; Joschko et al., 1993). Certain termites can construct tunnel systems with oval cross sections (Kooistra, 1982a; Abe, 1990) or produce channels with flat floors and arched roofs (Brewer, 1964; Abe, 1990), where the termites can pass each other. Regular primary faunal channels with smooth walls can be distinguished from primary root channels by their less perfectly round shapes and by the presence of irregular compressed zones in the soil material along the pore walls (Fig. 6) (Kooistra, 1982b; Kooistra & Brussaard, 1995). Channel types and diameters can be used to identify certain species or species groups (Fig. 7), when the species groups present in

the soil differ substantially in body width and type of channel system they produce. However, care has to be taken because juveniles of larger species can produce channels with smaller diameters than adults of smaller species (Kooistra & Brussaard, 1995).

# 2.2 Chambers

Chambers are enlargements in void systems produced by soil fauna for different purposes. Generally they are round or oval, but irregularly shaped chambers also occur.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/3f26c930-94fa-4c31-8626-99d6697f3bdc/2fcd19652dff716f7704fddc0c6c0792362b7c5782c39da9e79f93f1473a981a.jpg)  
FIGURE 7 Channel widths of six different earthworm species. After Kooistra & Brussaard (1995).

Non-social species (e.g., dung beetles, diplopods, earthworms) produce enlargements for retreat, reproduction or deposition of reproduction-related materials such as eggs, seeds, capsules or nutrition for larvae (see Fig. 5) (Kooistra, 1982b). Chambers are often associated with channel systems. However, they can also be constructed along existing vertical planar voids (Fig. 8) (Kooistra, 1978).

The most complex and variable channel and chamber systems, however, are built by the social soil fauna such as ants and termites. The large galleries or chamber systems are used for food production (e.g., fungal cones), temperature regulation in the nest and bypassing. Special chambers are built for the queen, the eggs and the early stages of new generations. Several termite and ant species construct not only subterranean

nests and galleries but also large aboveground mounds. To study the large and more complex channel systems, chambers, galleries, nests and mounds formed by soil fauna, researchers have often used macromorphological techniques rather than micromorphology.

# 2.3 Modified Voids

Smaller mesofauna, such as Acarina, Collembola and enchytraeids, do not generally produce their own void systems but use existing voids and locally enlarge them, which results in irregularly shaped, modified voids (Fig. 8B) (Kooistra & Brussaard, 1995). These organisms often feed on bacteria, algae and fungi that live on the void walls, thereby consuming also fine-grained soil material from the walls. Macrofauna such as earthworms can also enlarge existing planar voids (see Fig. 5). Interactions in time and space between different soil organisms can lead to the formation of complex modified voids (Fig. 9). Ultimately soil horizons can become depleted in fine-grained soil material leading to secondary packing voids between coarse-grained soil particles (Fig. 10A).

# 3.1 Excrements

Only the soil fauna that consume solid organic and mineral materials produce recognisable excrements. Excrements can be described according to shape, size, composition, smoothness of the surface, surface features, internal fabric and organisation (Bal, 1973). They vary largely in shape, ranging from individual units with specific shape to shapeless compact masses. Mites, enchymraeids, diplopods and isopods usually produce individual units (Fig. 11A to C), whereas earthworm excreta (Figs. 10B, 11D and 12) are often more or less coalescent (Fig. 11D). A summary of the main shapes of intact excrements and the corresponding soil mesofauna species is given by Bullock et al. (1985) and Stoops (2003). The size of excrements may vary considerably even for one species, because of differences between juveniles and adults. Clearly shaped excrements have also been called droppings (Kubiëna, 1938), fecal pellets (Brewer, 1964) and modexi (Bal, 1973).

Excrements are composed of organic material or mixtures of organic and mineral materials. The organic material may contain recognisable cell structures (Fig. 12A) and/or consist of more decomposed material, and it can include fungal hyphae and pollen. The mineral material is generally fine-grained, whereby the upper grain-size limit may be used for identification of the species (Kooistra et al., 1990). Excrements of earthworms (Jongmans et al., 2001) and of several mollusk species (Kooistra, 1978) may comprise a coating of clay-sized material around a core which includes coarse mineral grains (Fig. 12B). Excrements with an organic coating, also called 'peritrophic membrane' (Bal, 1970, 1973) are generally produced by epigeic earthworms.

For a number of invertebrate species the characteristic excreta are known. An overview of the excreta of Acarina, Collembola, Enchytraeidae, Diptera, Coleoptera and larvae of other insects, diplopods, isopods and lumbricids can be found in Rusek (1985). Figure 11 illustrates some types of excrements occurring in cultivated soils.

Excreta can frequently not be identified without doubt and assignment of excrement types to specific soil fauna needs to be made with care (Davidson et al., 2002). Many taxonomically different organisms produce very similar excrements, and excrements of the same species may have a different composition and morphology depending on the type of substrate consumed (Babel & Vogel, 1989; FitzPatrick, 1993). Consequently, not only shape and size but also location in the soil profile and environmental conditions in relation to the occurrence of soil faunal species need to be considered when attempting to relate excrements to specific groups or species of organisms.

Ageing and associated microbiological, physical and chemical processes lead to gradual morphological changes in the excrements (Fig. 13A), which eventually are no longer recognisable as excrements (Fig. 13B) (e.g., Davidson et al., 2002; Pulleman et al., 2005b). Excrements can also be modified by human interference, e.g., through ploughing (Spek et al., 2003), changes in land use or land drainage. Several types of ageing of excrements have been described (Bullock et al., 1985; Stoops, 2003).

# 3.2 Coatings

Faunal coatings are found on the walls of channels that have been used for long periods (Jongerius, 1957) or of channels crossing unstable soils or sediments or regularly flooded soils (Kooistra, 1978, 1982b). In older literature they are described as cutans (Brewer, 1960). The material used for the coatings can be derived from fine-grained soil fragments transported by termites (Fig. 14A) from excrements (Fig. 14B) or from locally accumulated wet or dry displaced soil material. It can also consist of a mixture of materials from different origins. Coatings composed of excreta are often darker than the surrounding groundmass due to the admixture of organic material. In unstable materials, such as soils in deserts, regularly flooded areas and intertidal flats, multilayered coatings composed of infillings material fixed to the walls by excreta are common. In wet areas,

several species of worms and pelecypods produce these multilayered coatings (Kooistra, 1978, 1981). Social soil fauna such as ants and termites build large complexes of subterranean nests or mounds with radiating plastered channels to the surrounding areas. These animals use aggregates of fine-grained soil material mixed with saliva to plaster their channels, chambers and galleries for stabilisation (see Fig. 3) (Miedema & Van Vuure, 1977; Kauffman, 1987).

# 3.3 Infillings

The large variety of infillings by soil fauna can be split up in three groups: (i) infillings with shaped units, (ii) infillings with a sharp external boundary, and (iii) infillings with a gradual external boundary. In older literature, channel infillings are termed pedotubules (Brewer & Sleeman, 1963) and crotovinas (Jongerius & Rutherford, 1979). Nearly all morphological types of infillings described in the micromorphological handbooks (Bullock et al., 1985; Stoops, 2003) can be produced by soil fauna as the result of their wide range of activities.

Any type of faunal void, with or without coating, can be filled to different degrees with shaped units. Such shaped units can be excrements but also small soil aggregates or single coarse mineral grains that were transported by soil animals such as termites (Fig. 14A) or they can be derived from the soil surface and have accumulated into the channel by different processes (Fig. 14B). Excrements can have different compositions and be present as accumulations of individual units or as clusters of more or less coalesced material (Fig. 15A).

Faunal voids with sharp external boundaries can be filled with soil material, as in the case of dung beetles (Fig. 15B) and cockchafers, or with shapeless excreta of a rather homogeneous composition produced by certain earthworm species (Fig. 15C). In some cases, the voids are filled with soil material as well as excrements deposited by the animal during passage. Such infillings can be formed by mollusks, beetle larvae and earthworms, and they often show a crescent fabric (Fig. 15D; see also Fig. 1).

Infillings with a gradual external boundary (Fig. 16) are formed during passage of soil animals through wet, plastic soils. The material flows back into the track immediately after passage, whereby elongated particles may become oriented. Excrements are commonly encountered in these tracks. Passage features are generally produced by snails, mollusks and worms (Kooistra, 1978).

# 3.4 Other Pedofeatures

Earthworms produce with their excreta cocoon-shaped features with a spherical to slightly ellipsoidal internal chamber (Fig. 17). These features, found in chambers, channel systems or planar voids, are used during diapause or to survive during unfavourable conditions.

Several biogenic carbonate products can be formed by the soil fauna (see Durand et al., 2018). Biogenic calcite nodules (e.g., Ponomareva, 1948; Bal, 1977) are common

features in clayey alluvial plains of humid, temperate and tropical climates (Kooistra, 1982b). They are produced by certain earthworm species to regulate the pH in the intestines (Pearce, 1972). The excreted calcite spheroids consist of sparitic calcite crystals, frequently arranged in a radial pattern (Jongmans et al., 2001), with sizes up to

several millimeters (see Durand et al., 2018). Biogenic calcite nodules observed in thin sections can be used as an indicator of current or past earthworm activity (Jongmans et al., 2001).

# 4. Features Related to Faunal Impact on Profile Development

Organic residues in O and A horizons are the primary source of food for soil fauna near the surface. In B and C horizons and less vegetated areas, the primary organic substrate for soil fauna is provided by soil organic matter incorporated into the soil by other organisms, roots, fungi and microorganisms, such as bacteria and algae. The decomposition of soil organic matter in O and A horizons is closely related to the presence of specific groups of soil micro-, meso- and macrofauna, which in turn depends on environmental conditions such as moisture availability, drainage and pH (Fig. 18). Clear stratifications into L, F and H layers are found under acid, cool and wet conditions where the activity of structure-forming soil fauna is limited. Under conditions of limited aeration and low pH, organic matter decomposition in the soil is slowed down and dominated by bacteria, microfauna and fungi, resulting in the formation of peat, anmoor or a mor humus type. Under drier and less acidic conditions, moder and mull humus forms are developed under the impact of meso- and macrofauna. Moder humus largely consists of accumulations of distinctly shaped excreta of mesofauna and is formed under moderately acidic conditions, mainly in sandy soils. Mull humus develops under neutral to basic soil conditions when earthworms dominate the decomposition

FIGURE 18 Main groups of soil organisms responsible for the decomposition of organic matter under varying moisture and pH conditions.

process, including the incorporation and intimate mixing of relatively fresh litter into the mineral soil matrix. Under conditions of moderate acidity and humidity, development of either a moder or a mull humus form is largely determined by the nutrient status and palatability of the leave litter, which in turn determines the composition of the soil fauna community (Pulleman et al., 2005a). For detailed description of micromorphological features related to soil organic matter decomposition, the reader is referred to Ismail-Meyer et al., 2018.

In soil horizons where organic inputs are limited, the abundance and diversity of soil fauna species is low. However, when these species are very mobile, they can have a large impact on soil structure. Their activity results in intensively bioturbated soil materials showing different kinds of superimposed infillings, with or without coatings. It can also produce granular textures consisting of organomineral excrements, with or without admixed coarse-grained groundmass material.

Consequently, the nature of a number of diagnostic A horizons, such as the mollic, umbric, antropic and plaggen epipedons, is determined by soil fauna activity. This is also the case for certain B horizons, such as oxic horizons with a granular microstructure (see Fig. 3) formed by termite activity (e.g., Kauffman, 1987; Jungerius et al., 1999; Schaefer, 2001) and former argillic horizons with a coarse granular microstructure (see Fig. 11) produced by tropical earthworms (Kooistra et al., 1990), as well as some spodic and cambic horizons (see Fig. 5) (e.g., Phillips & FitzPatrick, 1999).

Transitions between mineral soil and parent material and/or weathered rock may be strongly affected by bioturbation (see Stoops & Schaefer, 2018). In extreme climates with high temperatures and/or distinct drought periods, the greatest faunal impact is found in the deeper B and C horizons (Barzanji & Stoops, 1974; Kooistra, 1982a). The impact of soil fauna is not necessarily directly related to the size of the populations or number of species. A few mollusks in a sandy tidal deposit can erase completely the original lamination and incorporate, by feeding on the suspension and excreting in the sediment,  $5\% - 8\%$  fine-grained organomineral material that could not have been deposited during sedimentation due to the high velocities of the tidal currents (Kooistra, 1978).

In agricultural soils, as long as the climate, soil type and crop management practices are favourable for the development of a substantial soil fauna population, high soil fauna activity can lead to the formation of a strongly biogenic soil structure, dominated by excrements and channels. This is the case of finely textured soils in (semi) humid climates under pasture (see Fig. 4), or to a lesser extent, under reduced or zero tillage systems. However, under the same climate and soil conditions, a compact physicogenic soil structure can be formed when management practices are not favourable for structure-forming soil fauna, as for example in the case of conventional tillage systems with low organic inputs or with high pesticide use (Kooistra et al., 1989; Jongmans et al., 2001, 2003; Pulleman et al., 2003, 2005b). Moreover, crop residues incorporated into tillage-induced aggregates can often not be reached by soil fauna (Fig. 19).

Important factors that determine soil fauna composition and activity, i.e., food sources, moisture, pH, temperature and soil disturbance, can change over time, for example due to sedimentation or erosion, drainage of waterlogged soils, changes in land use and amelioration or deep tillage of agricultural soils. Complex features resulting from sudden disturbances or gradually changing environmental conditions and populations are commonly encountered in thin sections (e.g., Hammond & Collins, 1983; Dawod & FitzPatrick, 1993; Spek et al., 2003; Kooistra et al., 2006) and may help in the reconstruction of past conditions and their chronology. On the other hand, human-induced changes in a landscape, such as drainage or amelioration, can lead to increased activity of soil fauna whereby all information in soil archives can become completely erased (Van Heeringen & Theunissen, 2001).

# 5. Conclusions

The decomposition and redistribution of soil organic matter, the excretion of fecal pellets that contribute to stable soil aggregation and the formation of continuous voids by soil fauna can have important implications for soil functions such as susceptibility to erosion, water infiltration, aeration, root growth, leaching of agrochemicals and carbon and nutrient dynamics. Moreover, organisms that alter the soil environment through burrowing and other structure-forming activities also modify the habitat of other biota. Important applications of micromorphological studies in relation to soil fauna are studies related to soil formation and humus development, landscape reconstruction, archaeology and faunal impact on soil functions as affected by soil management.

Regarding future research, micromorphological studies of soil faunal features can offer a valuable contribution as part of an integrated approach aimed at elucidating the role of soil fauna diversity and their functions in soils. Currently, the growing interest in understanding soil biodiversity and the functional role of soil fauna in soils and ecosystems (Davidson & Grieve, 2006; Brussaard et al. 2007) calls for a more integrated approach to the study of soil fauna and its function in soils. The combination of micromorphological methods with other techniques such as field and laboratory manipulations of soil fauna, isolation of fauna-induced soil structural elements and novel physical, chemical or biological soil analyses provides a promising approach for future studies of the role of soil fauna.

# 1. Introduction

Organic matter is universal to all soils. The form and distribution of soil organic matter is dependent on a number of processes that may act independently or in concert. Most of these processes are related to the initial decomposition of accumulated plant residues by a suite of soil fauna and to the continued decomposition, transport and accumulation of the by-products. Descriptions of the forms, distribution and genesis of organic components in soils can range from quite simple to extremely complex. Micromorphological approaches to descriptions are comparably varied. For example, in one of the seminal works focused on concepts and terminology in micromorphology, Brewer (1964) essentially ignored the soil organic matter component, whereas others have proposed detailed approaches to describe its form and distribution in soils (Kubiëna, 1953; Barratt, 1969; Bal, 1973; De Coninck et al., 1974; Babel, 1975; Fox, 1984; Pawluk, 1987). Reviewing each of these approaches is beyond the scope of this chapter. Instead, we will use the descriptive system outlined by Bullock et al. (1985) and Stoops (2003) as our context and relate the various features and horizons or layers described in other works to this system to assist the reader in understanding the source and genesis of soil organic matter observed in thin sections using optical microscopy, at scales of tens of micrometres and greater. The descriptive system of Bullock et al. (1985) and Stoops (2003) for organic matter was primarily based on an extensive review by Babel (1975). Although Babel's work is more than four decades old, readers are encouraged to also consider his text in their studies.

Soil organic matter includes all organic matter derived from living organisms in soils. Examples range from a newly fallen leaf, roots, animal residues and droppings to carbon-rich gel, as dopplerite or organic pigment (Stoops, 2003). The term humus refers to materials containing  $60 - 80\%$  of degraded soil organic matter. Humus is rich in lignin (see Section 2.1) and forms amorphous colloids (Osman, 2013; Eash et al., 2016). Of all the features, horizons and constituents of soils examined under the microscope, soil organic matter is arguably the most dynamic. In environments where microbes, fungi and macroinvertebrates are very active (moist, aerobic conditions during the warmest of seasons), soil organic matter features such as fine roots may decompose in a matter of days (Hendrick & Pregitzer, 1997; Arnone et al., 2000; Tingey et al., 2000). In such cases, the thin section represents only a snapshot of soil conditions at the moment of sampling. Conversely, under highly anaerobic, waterlogged conditions (e.g., in peat; Aber et al., 2012), or in subsurface horizons such as spodic horizons and buried surface horizons rich in soil organic matter (Blazejewski et al., 2005), decomposition of organic matter may be very slow and the thin section represents stable soil conditions relative to this component.

Several difficulties are encountered when examining thin sections of soil material rich in organic matter. Because soil organic matter is much more susceptible to shrinkage upon drying than mineral components, and because it typically holds a considerable amount of water, thin sections of these materials often contain artefacts of the

production process. Thus, care should be taken during thin section preparation to ensure that the soil organic matter features observed are representative of the soil materials and not artificial. Reviews of various approaches to remove water and prepare thin sections of soil organic matter can be found in a number of publications (e.g., FitzPatrick & Gudmundsson, 1978; Fox, 1985; Murphy, 1986; Fox & Parent, 1993; Lopez-Buendia, 1998; De Vleeschouwer et al., 2008; Kooistra, 2015). Because organic matter is so dynamic at the soil surface, sampling of organic material in surface horizons should include not only the central part of the A horizon but also its top and the litter layer.

Determination of specific organic remains in thin sections is possible (see Section 2) but can be challenging due to the state of preservation, as well as due to the random orientation of cross sections through the remains (radial, transversal, tangential or intermediate). Other difficulties encountered when studying soil organic matter and related features in thin sections include distinguishing between dark organic features and other components that are equally dark, typically rich in Fe or Mn oxides. Depending on the material and the objectives of the study, these problems can be overcome by studying the thin sections using fluorescence microscopy or by chemical treatment of the samples (Stoops, 2003). Some of these methods can also be used to assist in the identification of the various plant cells and tissues (e.g., Babel, 1972b; Stoops, 2003). Available treatments for distinguishing organic material from other compounds include bleaching with sodium hypochlorite (see Babel, 1964a, 1964b, 1975). An example of a common treatment in fluorescence microscopy is staining with fluorochromes (Tippkötter, 1990), such as acridine orange. Cell walls and roots in samples treated with acridine orange can be distinguished by a greenish colour under blue light excitation, whereas other materials such as clay appear orange to yellow (Altemüller & Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1990).

# 2. Organic Materials

# 2.1 Fresh Materials

Litter and roots from plants that are currently growing at a given site are the primary sources of the soil organic matter in surface and near-surface horizons. To identify specific plant residues in thin sections, an understanding of the anatomy of plants in general, as well as that of the particular plant species growing at the site, is necessary. As an aid to identify the components of higher plants under the microscope, several handbooks and atlases in the field of botany, plant anatomy and plant physiology are available (e.g., Bracegirdle & Miles, 1971; Esau, 1977; Schweingruber, 1982; Gifford & Foster, 1989; Schoch et al., 2004; Botanical Society of America, 2008; Upton et al., 2011). Especially in waterlogged, anaerobic environments, where plant remains are mainly well preserved, it is often possible to differentiate between wood, wood bark, twigs (and/or roots), deciduous leaves, remains of true grasses (Poaceae), seeds/fruits and mosses (see Ismail-Meyer, 2017).

The higher vascular plants consist of different types of tissues such as the epidermis (single-cell surface layer), the vascular tissues or vessels for conduction (phloem and xylem) and the ground tissue. The latter can be divided into parenchyma (thin-walled cells, filler tissue, food storage cells), sclerenchyma (lignin-rich tissue, as fibres and stone cells, phlobaphene-containing tissues) and collenchyma (irregularly thickened cells in leaves and stems) (Babel, 1975; FitzPatrick, 1993; Gifford & Foster, 1989; Upton et al., 2011) (see Figs. 1 to 3; Table 1).

Wood, bark and twigs from conifers (gymnosperms), deciduous trees and shrubs (angiosperms) can often be distinguished under the microscope (Fig. 1A to E). In temperate zones, annual rings are built in the sapwood and heartwood (xylem). Conifer wood shows very distinct year rings, uniseriate pith rays and small vessels (tracheids) (Fig. 1A and B). Deciduous wood has uni- or multiseriate pith rays and bigger vessels (trachea), which are arranged ring-porous or diffuse-porous (Fig. 1C and D). Wellpreserved wood shows first-order interference colours and a blue colour under fluorescent light because of preserved cellulose in the cell walls. The outer bark or cork consists of sclerenchymatic cells, which show a characteristic parallel arrangement and are often squashed and deformed. They contain tannins (phlobaphenes), which give them a dark brown to reddish colour (Fig. 1E and F). Gymnosperm bark may contain pale sclerenchymatic stone cells and fibres (Gifford & Foster, 1989). Good wood/twig sections can be determined by the use of wood atlases (e.g., Schweingruber, 1982; Schoch et al., 2004).

Deciduous leaves show a characteristic cross section (Fig. 2A and B) with the upper epidermis, underlain by a palisade layer, followed by an interval consisting of loose parenchyma tissue (mesophyll) and that also comprises leaf veins (ribs), followed by the lower epidermis with stomata. In thin sections, leaves appear as elongated, yellowish to dark brown structures; the leaf veins with their complex form and the palisade layer are often the most striking characteristics (Babel, 1964b; Upton et al., 2011). Conifer needles consist of a loose parenchyma tissue (mesophyll) enclosing one or two central veins and are covered by an epidermis with stomata. The shape in cross section may indicate to which tree species the needles belong: fir needles (Abies) exhibit a 'coat hanger' shape with two resin ducts (Fig. 2C and D); spruce needles (Picea) are four-sided to diamond-shaped, whereas pine needles (Pinus) have a semicircular shape and show two resin ducts towards the flat side (Schoch et al., 1988; Gifford & Foster, 1989; Ismail-Meyer, 2017). The epidermis, the stomata and part of the veins (xylem) may show interference colours (Babel, 1975; FitzPatrick, 1993; Tian et al., 1997).

Leaves of true grasses (Poaceae) consist of an epidermis (the upper side containing stomata) and spongy parenchyma with embedded veins, in the form of three pores arranged in a manner producing a skull-like appearance. Under the microscope the leaves are usually elongated and show distinct shapes in cross section, such as flat, folded, boat-shaped, or with rolled-in edges (Fig. 2E and F). Poaceae stems have a round cross section, and the characteristic leaf veins are usually arranged around the outer rim

(Gifford & Foster, 1989; Ismail-Meyer, 2017). Grasses usually contain phytoliths, which may be hidden by the organic tissues (see Vrydaghs et al., 2017; Kaczorek et al., 2018).

Plant seeds are often small ( $< 1\mathrm{mm}$ ) and show a complex anatomy, with several layers and differing tissues. The central, nutritive tissue of the seeds (endosperm) is degraded very quickly; thus seeds are often empty (Gifford & Foster, 1989; Kenward & Hall, 2000). In thin sections, colour and interference colours can be distinct (see Fig. 3). Seeds such as cereals, rice and maize may contain starch grains, which look similar to calcite spherulites (see Canti & Brochier, 2017a). Usually, cereal grains are preserved in a charred state, with burst starch easily recognised by its popcorn-like appearance (Ismail-Meyer, 2017).

Roots show many different patterns, but usually they consist of an epidermis, a cortex containing reddish-brown tannins and a central cylinder with conductive vessels (Fig. 4A and B). The central cylinder is often completely decomposed. Woody roots may look very similar to twigs. Roots are often better preserved than organic matter from other sources in the same sample (Babel, 1975; FitzPatrick, 1990; Hather, 1993; Blazejewski et al., 2005).

Mosses, as non-vascular plants, show a simple structure, consisting of stalks with a thickened epidermis, a parenchyma rim and a central duct. The wing-like leaves may still be in connection to the stalks and consist of one to three identical cell layers. In thin sections, leaf mosses have a yellowish to brown colour (Fig. 4C and D), whereas turf mosses are almost transparent (Fig. 4E and F). Mosses do not contain lignin, but the cellulose in the cell walls shows interference colours (Collins & Kuehl, 2001; Mauquoy & Van Geel, 2007; De Vleeschouwer et al., 2008; Müller & Frahm, 2013; Ismail-Meyer, 2017).

Aquatic plants, such as algae, generally have no supporting tissues and contain no lignin or cellulose. Algal tissues are therefore usually not preserved, even in waterlogged environments (Collins & Kuehl, 2001; Blume et al., 2016), but their seeds (Fig. 3C to F) and oogonia can occur as remnants (e.g., Nymphaceae, Charales). Algal remains can be abundant in limnic carbonate environments, in the form of specific biogenic calcium carbonate precipitates (e.g., Freytet & Verrecchia, 2002).

In some soils, simple plants such as algae play an important role in soil organic matter dynamics (Lund, 1962; MacEntee et al., 1972; Hunt et al., 1979). Dodge and Shubert (1996) present an overview of the most common algal types and associated soil settings. Additions of carbon from lichens, fungi, mosses and algae are particularly important in desert and arctic environments where soil crusting occurs (Cameron & Devaney, 1970; Verrecchia, 2000; Asta et al., 2001; Hu et al., 2003; Williams et al., 2018) and in subaqueous environments where remains of marine or limnic fauna accumulate (Kubiëna, 1953).

In depositional environments such as floodplains, alluvial fans and lake margins, as well as in settings with anthropogenic accumulation such as agricultural fields where manure has been added, the origin and initial degree of decomposition of the plant remains is often unknown. Identifying the pathways leading to decomposition of soil organic matter in situ in these cases can be quite difficult (Macphail et al., 2003). However, recent studies of opal phytoliths using thin sections provide important information about degradation and in situ preservation of organic material

(Vrydaghs et al., 2017). On the other hand, organic matter accumulations related to waste deposition or in situ combustion may reveal significant information regarding former vegetation, land use and human occupation (Kooistra & Kooistra, 2003; Ismail-Meyer et al., 2013).

If horizons rich in organic matter of natural or anthropogenic origin are buried under anaerobic condition, preservation of macrobotanical remains and pollen may as well help in identifying the use of plants and soil that characterised the former land surface (Bernabo & Webb, 1977; Brugam, 1978; Nelson, 1984; Winkler, 1985; Parshall et al., 2003; Kuhn et al., 2013). Information about pollen analysis in thin sections can be found in publications by Allison et al. (1986), Van Mourik (1999, 2003) and Kooistra and Kooistra (2003). The study of insect remains and diatoms has not yet been a specific subject in micromorphological research, but it may provide useful environmental insights in the future.

# 2.2 Partially and Fully Decomposed Materials or Humus

Plant decomposition occurs in aerobic and anaerobic environments and is analogous to mineral weathering, whereby organic components go through a series of transformations representing a fundamental pedogenic process (Simonson, 1959; Fanning & Fanning, 1989; Buol et al., 2011). Plants consist of not only different tissues (see Section 2.1; Table 1) but also diverse molecular components, i.e., approximately  $15 - 40\%$  cellulose,  $10 - 43\%$  hemicellulose,  $25 - 40\%$  lignin,  $1 - 10\%$  waxes and lipids and  $1 - 15\%$  proteins (Osman, 2013). Which organic remains or plant parts decay depends not only on tissue type and chemical composition but also on moisture and oxygen content as well as temperature and  $\mathsf{pH}$  of the environment (Eash et al., 2016). Easily degradable substances (sugars, proteins, amino acids, lipids, fats, oil, waxes) are quickly lost. Tissues made up of cellulose, such as collenchyma, phloem and parenchyma, also decay rapidly. Lignin-rich issues such as sclerenchyma (xylem, vascular bundles, pith rays) and phlobaphene-containing tissues such as cork (outer bark) are usually better preserved (Babel, 1965; Bal, 1973; Gifford & Foster, 1989; Tian et al., 1997; Osman, 2013; Strawn et al., 2015; Eash et al., 2016). Lignin, one of the most resistant organic compounds, decays only at the final stage of aerobic decomposition and is therefore the main constituent of humus, consisting of approximately  $45\%$  lignin,  $35\%$  amino acids,  $4\%$  cellulose,  $7\%$  hemicellulose and  $9\%$  fats, waxes, resins and other substances (Osman, 2013; Blume et al., 2016).

The decay of organic matter can be divided into alteration and decomposition (see Figs. 5 and 6). Alteration includes fungal and bacterial degradation, which can be seen in thin sections as discolouration and deformation of cells, browning, blackening, gelification, colonisation by fungi and dislocation of cells (Fig. 6A to E). Altered remains may keep their shape for a long time, which allows their identification (Babel, 1997; Stoops, 2003; Kooistra, 2015). Decomposition of organic matter, mainly due to fragmentation caused by meso- and macrofauna (Fig. 6F), can produce organ residues and organic fine material. Further decomposition can be caused by physical processes such as desiccation, wetting and drying, freezing and thawing, resulting in cell deformation, development of openings in tissues (Fig. 6A) and formation of organic fine material (Blazejewski et al., 2005; Strawn et al., 2015). Humic substances (fulvic acid, humic acid and humin) arise from microbial decomposition (Osman, 2013; Strawn et al., 2015; Eash et al., 2016). As a result of this process, gelified organic matter and dopplerite may be formed (Fig. 6G and H). Dopplerite, or waterhard, is pale-yellowish brown to dark brown, translucent material, commonly crossed by cracks upon drying. It forms during early diagenesis of plant tissues in an anaerobic, subaqueous or waterlogged environment, as in peat and hydric soils (see Section 5) (Lewis, 1882; Babel, 1975; FitzPatrick, 1993; Koopman, 1988; Sebag et al., 2006; Feller et al., 2010; Ismail-Meyer et al., 2013; Ismail-Meyer, 2014). Further investigation regarding the formation of gelified organic matter and dopplerite is clearly needed. Complete decomposition of organic matter leads to breakdown into inorganic compounds, such

as carbon dioxide, water, phosphates, sulphates and cations (Osman, 2013; Strawn et al., 2015; Eash et al., 2016).

Different environments favour specific degradation patterns. Under aerobic, neutral or basic conditions, macro- and mesofaunal decay may be strong. In contrast, at low pH, fungal activity can be dominant, whereas under anaerobic, waterlogged conditions, bacterial activity results in gelification of organic matter and decomposition of cellulose. The dominant degrading agent and decomposition environment can in some cases be identified (see Blanchette, 2000; Kim & Singh, 2000; Schwarze, 2007; Nilsson & Björdal, 2008).

Turnover times, i.e., the average time that soil organic matter resides in a soil from its entry to complete decay, range from days to more than several centuries, with most decomposition occurring shortly after deposition and mostly within less than 10 years (Arnone et al., 2000; Kenward & Hall, 2000; Tingey et al., 2000; Blazejewski et al., 2005; Lützow et al., 2006; Osman, 2013; Strawn et al., 2015). For example, Babel (1964b) observed that beech leaves in the litter horizon of a mull (see Section 4.3) had lost the main part of their phloem and collenchyma after six months.

# 2.3 Charcoal and Related Materials

Black carbon results from the incomplete combustion of vegetation and fossil fuels (Goldberg, 1985; Jones et al., 1997; Masiello, 2004; Forbes et al., 2006). The two primary components of black carbon are charcoal and ash. The source of most charcoal fragments is organic materials burned at the soil surface (e.g., during forest fires) or charred organic materials burned off-site and applied to the soil together with ash. The charcoal can be incorporated into the soil through sedimentation, bioturbation or tillage. Fine charcoal fragments  $(< 50\mu \mathrm{m}$ ; soot) may be deposited by water or wind. The black colour, opaque nature and sharp boundaries help discern charcoal from other organic materials (Babel, 1964c; Bullock et al., 1985). Large pieces  $(>30\mu \mathrm{m})$  of charcoal typically exhibit cell structure (Fig. 7A and B). Calcitic wood ashes (Fig. 7C and D) may be identified because of their rhomboidal crystal shape and pseudomorphism after plant cells (Canti & Brochier, 2017b). The ashes are easily blown away by wind or dissolved. Wood ashes may be present in caves, in open-air sites or in waterlogged anthropogenic accumulations (Schiegl et al., 1996; Ismail-Meyer et al., 2013; Canti & Brochier, 2017b). Another remnant of burnt plant material can be vesicular glass derived from phytoliths that were present (see Kaczorek et al., 2018).

# 3. Soil Organic Matter Horizons and Profiles

Soil organic matter accumulates when microbial decomposition occurs at rates that are slower than those of the addition of organic matter (Simonson, 1959; Collins & Kuehl, 2001).

Organic soils belong to the soil order Histosols and include the suborders Folists, Fibrists, Hemists and Saprists (Soil Survey Staff, 2014). Folists are not permanently wet and form in upland areas and forests (moder, mull, mor and anmoor; see Section 4). Fibrists, Hemists and Saprists form under permanent wet conditions (hydric soils, peat; see Section 5). Soils with an organic surface layer that is  $20 - 40\mathrm{cm}$  thick belong to mineral soils with a histic or folistic epipedon (Collins & Kuehl, 2001; Soil Survey Staff, 2014; for correlation with the European classification of humus forms, see Zanella et al., 2011). Histosols often occur in transitional zones between dry upland areas and lacustrine or marine environments, but they are also present in grassland, permafrost regions, anthropogenic deposits, floodplains and alluvial fans (dy, gytta, sapropel; see Section 5.5) (Aber et al., 2012; Kooistra, 2015).

In Histosols, various stages of decomposition or preservation of soil organic matter are often clearly identifiable within L, F and H horizons, as used in the Canadian Soil Classification (Soil Classification Working Group, 1998), and in the underlying A horizon. The horizon symbols refer to litter (L), fragmentation or fermentation (F) and humus (H), corresponding to fibric (Oi), hemic (Oe) and sapric (Oa) horizons in Soil Taxonomy (see Buol et al., 2011; Osman, 2013). On the basis of micromorphological observations, Babel (1972a) further subdivided these horizons according to degree of decomposition, types of decomposers, degree of mixing and relative amounts of fine material, residues and roots. Similar observations were made by Ponge (1999) and described as a series of Oi, Oe, Oa and A horizons that follow the Soil Taxonomy system for horizon designation (Soil Survey Staff, 2014). Micromorphological examination and quantifications by Ponge (1999) showed clear boundary distinctness between Oi and Oe horizons and between Oe and Oa horizons. The boundary between the Oa and upper A horizons, however, was not objectively distinguishable under the microscope.

The thickness and macro- and micromorphological characteristics of the various organic horizons and mineral horizons rich in organic matter depend on a number of factors, such as frequency and duration of water saturation, pH, nutrient status, plant community and soil fauna (Jongerius & Schelling, 1960; Kooistra, 1991; Phillips & FitzPatrick, 1999; Ponge, 1999; Davidson et al., 2002). For example, in boreal forests, thick surface horizons that are rich in organic matter develop because of slow litter

decomposition, whereas tropical forests do not include such surface intervals because the large amounts of litter that are produced are quickly decomposed, within approximately one year (Osman, 2013). Although the majority of soil organic matter is contained in surface or near-surface organic layers and A horizons, certain B horizons can be dominated by illuvial organic matter. For example, organic matter in spodic horizons typically occurs as coatings or infillings (see Van Ranst et al., 2018). In addition to spodic horizons, buried O and A horizons may occur well below the soil surface in palaeosols, e.g., interglacial soils covered by glacial tills or palaeosols in loess, or in streamside riparian zones that may contain significant amounts of organic matter (Blazejewski et al., 2005; Blume et al., 2016).

Soil scientists have long recognised that, under most conditions, organic matter will become distributed throughout the soil profile in an organised and predictable pattern. The majority of the literature points to Müller (1887) as the first to recognise these

patterns and to start introducing the various distribution names such as mull and mor. Kubiëna (1953) described 34 different profile types dominated by horizons rich in soil organic matter. The main types include moder, mull, mull-like moder, gyttja, dy, anmoor and raw, raw-soil and tangel humus. Most of these types are discussed in the following sections. Since the work of Kubiëna (1953), these terms have been used, amended and redefined by numerous authors studying soils under the microscope (see Green et al., 1993). Discussions of the use and misuse of the terms in micromorphological studies related to soil morphology and genesis can be found in various publications (e.g., Jongerius & Schelling, 1960; Barratt, 1964, 1969; Bal, 1970, 1973; Bullock, 1974; Babel, 1975; Ponge, 1999; Ampe & Langohr, 2003). General problems are the use of multiple terms to describe the same horizon or distribution (e.g., mor vs. raw humus) and the use of the same terms to describe both a single horizon rich in soil organic matter and a group of horizons that are dominated by soil organic matter (humus profile; Bal, 1970). Babel (1975) suggests that the terms represent the entire profile but that the profile is typified by a particular horizon (e.g., the Ah horizon for mull). Resolving the inconsistencies in the use of soil organic matter distribution terminology is beyond the scope of this chapter.

# 4. Forest Soils

# 4.1 Moder

Moder, one of the most common terrestrial humus forms, is intermediate between mor and mull (see Sections 4.2 and 4.3). It is characterised by the presence of mineral-deficient coprogenic constituents (Jongerius & Rutherford, 1979) that are mixed with tissue residues and fine organic materials (Fig. 8). Moder humus is found in organic surface layers (L, F, H horizons), in A horizons and in Bh horizons of Spodosols. Moder profiles consist of L, F, H and A horizons. Kubiëna (1953) indicates that moders can be present in both deciduous and coniferous forests, with a range of soil fauna being responsible for decomposition. Micromorphological descriptions of moders can be found in numerous publications (e.g., Dalrymple, 1958; Jongerius & Schelling, 1960; Barratt, 1964; Babel, 1972a; Pawluk, 1987; Fox & Parent, 1993; Dijkstra, 1998; Ponge, 1999; Frouz & Novakova, 2005; Mori et al., 2009; Zaiets & Poch, 2016). Micromorphological descriptions by Bal (1970) of two moder profiles developed under red oak and Douglas fir provide the foundation for the following synthesis of the morphology and genesis of a typical moder. These descriptions illustrate the formation of surface and near-surface horizons that are rich in soil organic matter, and at the same time they indicate the complexity of the morphology, distribution and genesis of soil organic matter in soils.

Under deciduous vegetation, such as oak, L horizons are relatively thin, consisting primarily of relatively unaltered leaves (up to  $75\%$  in a temperate forest; Osman, 2013). Some leaves may show the first signs of faunal decomposition. Leaves in the upper F horizon are much denser than those in the overlying L horizon, and in places they are

covered with dark excrements as a result of the activity of fauna such as earthworms and true fly larvae (Diptera) and bacteria. The size and shape of the excrements, in the F horizon and below, provide clues to the predominant type of faunal activity (see Kooistra & Pulleman, 2018). Leaf residues of the upper F horizon are primarily epidermis and lignin-rich veins (and stalks). The lower F horizon often contains much excrements and generally few small leaf residues. Small organisms such as Diptera larvae are likely the most important producers of excrement. The process leading to the integration of soil organic matter into excrements has been termed 'vermoderung' (Bal, 1970).

Under coniferous trees, such as Douglas fir, L horizons of modern profiles are typically thicker than those under deciduous trees because needles are more resistant to decomposition than leaves of deciduous plants (Bal, 1970; Ampe & Langohr, 2003). The only indications of needle decomposition are the few areas of dark excrements resulting from the activity of primary decomposers such as potworms (Enchytraeidae), mites

(Phtiracaridae) and crane fly larvae (Tipulidae). The upper F horizon of coniferous moder profiles is composed of needle organ residues, and their alteration is a product of the activity of fauna such as fungus gnats (Mycetophilidae), mites and crane fly larvae. The predominance of particular soil fauna in specific horizons rich in organic matter has been observed in numerous studies (e.g., Dinc et al., 1976; Phillips & FitzPatrick, 1999; Ponge, 1999; Davidson et al., 2002). For example, mite larvae excrements are often found within decomposing needles and roots, especially in the Fm horizon (Oe2 horizon). The H horizon is primarily composed of pellets (also observed in the overlying Fm horizon) with minor amounts of needle tissues. The pellets are the result of 'ageing', which refers to the decomposition, collapse and coalescence of excrements as a result of physical, chemical and microbial processes (Bal, 1970; Jongerius & Rutherford, 1979; Phillips & FitzPatrick, 1999; Davidson, 2002; Stoops, 2003). The combination of pellets and needle organ residues provides a very loose and spongy character to the F and underlying H horizons that is not observed under deciduous forest (red oak). The absence of earthworms under coniferous forest (Douglas fir moder) was also noted by Bal (1970) as contributing to differences in organic matter micromorphology and distribution between soils formed under coniferous versus deciduous vegetation.

Roots are apparent in the lower F and H horizons and in the mineral soil horizons of modern profiles. Decomposition of the roots follows a number of pathways that depend on the type of soil fauna. The morphology of final stages of root decomposition observed by Bal (1970) is similar to that of the root traces and irregular nodules described by Blazejewski et al. (2005). Over time, roots break down and root-derived carbon disperses into the surrounding soil to form root traces. Eventually, the carbon associated with root traces can become partially consumed by soil microbes or mixed with the surrounding mineral material by pedoturbation.

Excrements, with a colour that grades to black with depth, are abundant in moder H horizons, which consist almost entirely of a dense layer of excrements. The excrements show a range of sizes  $(< 0.3 - 2.0\mathrm{mm})$ , with the larger excrements generally associated with larger potworms and some smaller epigeic earthworms. The denser fabric and darker colours in the lower H horizon are attributed to ageing of the excrements. In A horizons of moders, small black excrements are commonly found. In sandy soils, aggregates of this type are dispersed between sand grains in an enaulic c/f-related distribution pattern (Ampe & Langohr, 2003; Macphail et al., 2003). Bal (1970) suggested that the pellet distribution is a result of illuviation of the smallest pellets from the H horizon. Evidence of illuviation is given by the layered arrangement of the aggregates between the sand grains. Davidson et al. (2002) questioned this interpretation and suggested that the arrangement of the pellets could be the result of bioturbation (Davidson et al., 1999). Similar pellet-dominated fabrics have been observed for spodic horizons (see Van Ranst et al., 2018) and plaggen soils (see Adderley et al., 2018).

Under certain conditions, variants of the moder profiles described in the previous paragraphs can form. Babel (1975) provided descriptions of rendzina, alpine pitch and mull-like moders. Rendzina moders are composed primarily of very small, black, loosely

packed droppings consisting mostly of calcium humates (Jongerius & Rutherford, 1979). This humus form is found predominately in shallow soils that develop on chalk or limestone (Kubiëna, 1953). Alpine pitch moders also form on limestone but at high elevations and under grasslands (Kubiëna, 1953). They are typically blackish to reddish brown. The H horizon is dominant, with a loose upper part, having an abundance of roots, and a dense lower part, showing cracking upon desiccation. Large plant residues are absent, but moderate quantities of very small residues are observed. Babel (1975) suggested that excrements were those of potworms or springtails (Collembola). Mull-like moders are dominated by Ah horizons, whereas F horizons are rare and H horizons are absent. Mixing is accomplished through a variety of soil fauna that occur in abundance. This humus form develops in grasslands and is differentiated from mulls by the small amount of clay that precludes formation of a clay-soil organic matter complex that is associated with mulls (Szabo et al., 1964; Jongerius & Rutherford, 1979).

# 4.2 Mor

Mor or raw humus (Kubiëna, 1953) is a terrestrial organic matter form consisting predominantly of well-preserved, though often fragmented, plant remains from forests, heaths and alpine ecosystems (twigs, branches, leaves, cones, grasses), with few excrements (Jongerius & Rutherford, 1979; Fox & Tarnocai, 2011). Generally, vegetation that creates acidic soil conditions, such as conifers, favours the formation of mor, in cool and humid environments, forming thick accumulations of folic material. The tissue residues that remain under the low pH conditions are selectively resistant to the primary decomposing organisms in the system, which are mostly fungi (white, brown and soft rot), soil mesofauna (i.e., Acarina species) and microorganisms (bacteria). Earthworms are usually absent below a pH of 4.8 (Meyer, 1964; Babel, 1975; Beyer, 1996; Fox & Tarnocai, 2011; Osman, 2013). As a result of microbial decomposition, organic matter in these L, F and H horizons is dark brown to black, shows loss of internal cell structures and breakdown of the leaf epidermis and can contain fungal mantles and hyphae. While in the F layer recognisable leaves make up to  $90\%$  of the organic fraction, they have almost completely disappeared in the H horizon, where only cork remains and root bark are still well preserved (Babel, 1965; Fox & Tarnocai, 2011). Because of the acidic environment, dissolved humic substances may form a spodic horizon (Beyer, 1996).

# 4.3 Mull

Jongerius & Rutherford (1979) defined a mull, from a micromorphological perspective, as a terrestrial humus form in which soil organic matter is mainly fine material in association with mineral components (mainly clay). Plant residues are few or absent; signs of earthworm activity can be strong. Mulls (Fig. 9) are usually found in nutrient-rich broadleaf forests, steppes, grassland and arable soils (Beyer, 1996; Kooistra, 2015). Thick mulls, typically thicker than  $25~\mathrm{cm}$ , are classified as mollic or umbric epipedons in

# 4.4 Anmoor

Anmoor profiles are typically ponded (semiterrestrial), often with black or dark grey horizons containing strongly decomposed soil organic matter, primarily in the form of aquatic animal excrements (Jongerius & Rutherford, 1979). In conditions with moderate water content, they have an earthy structure, which becomes muddy with persistent water saturation (Babel, 1975). Micromorphological descriptions of anmoors can be found in a number of publications (e.g., Kubiëna, 1953; Jongerius & Schelling, 1960; Jongerius, 1961; Menge, 1965; Loustau & Toutain, 1987). Diatoms are often present in anmoors under permanent water. Excrements are generally well decomposed and difficult to identify,

especially where surface water saturation conditions vary throughout the year. Most of the soil organic matter is colloidal, with any plant residues that are present being fine. Kubiëna (1953) provided micromorphological descriptions of several annoor subtypes, including eutrophic, dystrophic, peat, pitch and pitch peat annoors. Dystrophic annoors contain considerable amounts of plant tissue and much less coprogenic material than eutrophic annoors. Peat annoors have a low mineral content because they form within the uppermost layer of submerged peat. Pitch annoors are a eutrophic form that in the wet state is primarily massive but may crack into angular blocks upon drying.

# 5. Wetland Soils or Hydric Histosols

Wetland soils with high organic matter content can have characteristic organic surface horizons, classified according to degree of degradation as fibric Oi horizon (peat), hemic Oe horizon (mucky peat) and sapric Oa horizon (muck) (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015; Soil Survey Staff, 2014). Wetland soils develop where land remains waterlogged or inundated for most of the time, favouring hydrophytic vegetation. They can be divided into marine wetlands (e.g., coastal, estuarine, tidal) and inland wetlands (e.g., riverine, lacustrine, palustrine), the latter including bogs, swamps, marshes, fens and peatlands.

In depressions and sloping areas that are water-saturated up to the soil surface, considerable soil organic matter will accumulate, because of slower and less efficient decomposition than in aerobic environments, with 5 to 40 times lower rates of degradation. Characteristics of wetland soils include reducing conditions, occurrence of dissolved organic matter and the presence of anaerobic bacteria that cause reduction of iron, manganese and sulphur (Kroetsch et al., 2011; Aber et al., 2012). Few micromorphological studies have focused just on peat (Bullock, 1974; Cohen & Spackman, 1992; Mooney et al., 2000; De Vleeschouwer et al., 2008). Early studies were reviewed by Babel (1975) and Lee (1983). Most of the discussion by Babel (1975) concerns the work of Kubiëna (1943), Gracanin (1962), Grosse-Brauckmann (1963, 1964), Grosse-Brauckmann and Puffe (1964) and Krause (1964), reported in terms of primary peats (continuous saturation) and secondary peats (affected by drainage or cultivation; see also Section 5.4). Dinc et al. (1976) reviewed the various approaches to classify peat based on micromorphology. Fox (1985) presented a review of peat micromorphology in relation to the US soil classification system. Other approaches to classify peat, based on decomposition, were suggested by Von Post (1924) and Malterer et al. (1992). Detailed overviews of characteristics of wetlands, including hydrology, chemistry and peat decomposition, can be found in various publications (e.g., Richardson & Vepraskas, 2001; Mitsch & Gosselink, 2007; Keddy, 2010; Aber et al., 2012).

# 5.1 Fibric Horizons

Most fibric horizons (Fig. 10A to F), designated as Oi horizons or peat, are dominated by coarse plant residues (as many as  $70\%$  larger than  $2\mathrm{mm}$ ), which are light yellowish to

reddish brown or dark brown and appear to have undergone little decomposition. Fibric horizons are common in raised bogs of boreal forest zones (Manoch, 1970; Dinc et al., 1976; Levesque & Dinel, 1982; Fox, 1985; Collins & Kuehl, 2001). Residues originate from herbaceous materials such as sedges and grasses, wood, moss (Sphagnum) (Fig. 10C and D) and seeds. They may be relatively large and are easily recognised under the microscope. Some fibric horizons may also contain minor amounts of materials that appear much darker than the yellow tissues and are similar to hemic or sapric material in degree of decomposition (Fig. 10A and B) (Lee & Manoch, 1974; Dinc et al., 1976).

# 5.2 Hemic Horizons

In general, hemic materials (Fig. 10E to H; Fig. 11A and B), assigned to the Oe horizon or mucky peat, are dominated by coarse plant residues, but a large portion of the groundmass consists of barely distinguishable plant residues and organic fine material (Manoch, 1970; Dinc et al., 1976; Levesque & Dinel, 1982; Fox, 1984, 1985; Mooney et al., 2000; Collins & Kuehl, 2001). They represent an intermediate degree of decomposition between fibric and sapric horizons. Coarse residues are often quite decomposed, and hemic horizons are thus generally darker than fibric horizons. The fabric is generally loosely packed and porous, with denser, poorly preserved excrements dispersed among the coarse tissue residues. Dissolved organic matter can be present and can react with other organic components or impregnate tissues (Kibblewhite et al., 2015). Dopplerite (see Section 2.2) may be present as pore infillings or thin layers (Babel, 1975).

# 5.3 Sapric Horizons

Most sapric materials (Fig. 11A to D), corresponding to the Oa horizon or muck, are dominated by black or dark brown organic fine material when viewed in incident light (Manoch, 1970; Lee & Manoch, 1974; Dinc et al., 1976; Levesque & Dinel, 1982; Fox, 1985; Collins & Kuehl, 2001). The few organ residues that are observed are dark brown and quite decomposed, which can make it difficult to identify the species from which they are derived (Fig. 11A and B). Sapric horizons are much denser than hemic or fibric horizons. A range of pore types is observed, including vughs, channels and packing voids (Dinc et al., 1976; Fox, 1985). Earthworm and mite excrements are often present (Fox, 1985). Sapric materials are common in many Histosols that have been drained and cultivated (Collins & Kuehl, 2001).

# 5.4 Peat Ripening

Although the transformation of soil organic matter deposits into peat (paludification) is considered an important process in the formation of Histosols (Buol et al., 2011), some authors do not consider peat to undergo pedogenesis until these water-saturated deposits are artificially drained or become dry during periods of major drought. When such changes in water saturation conditions occur, the pores fill with air and decomposition

rates increase, resulting in subsidence of the peat ('ripening'; Pons, 1960). Babel (1975) and Bouma et al. (1990) reviewed micromorphological studies focused on peat that has undergone ripening; the peat is transformed to a much denser material having prismatic, granular, blocky (Fig. 11E and F) or platy microstructure (Kuiper & Slager, 1963; Lee & Manoch, 1974; Fox, 1984, 1985). The increase in faunal activity as a result of ripening greatly reduces the volume of plant residues and increases the relative amount of organic fine material, which can be easily removed by water and/or wind (Babel, 1975; Dinc et al., 1976; Hammond & Collins, 1983; Mitsch & Gosselink, 2007). Extreme ripening may result in formation of mulls or moders from previously water-saturated peats (Jongerius & Pons, 1962).

# 5.5 Dy, Gyttja and Sapropel

Non-peaty layers with high organic matter content that developed in low-energy subaqueous environments include dy, gyttja and sapropel. Such deposits can be found in floodplains, fans and deltas of rivers and streams. Organic matter accumulates at the sediment-water interface from suspension or when its specific weight exceeds that of water. Degradation of the organic matter occurs under anaerobic conditions. Micromorphological studies focused on dy, gyttja and sapropel are very limited (Kubiëna, 1953; Babel, 1975).

Dys (or peat mud), occurring in subaqueous Fluvisols (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015; Blume et al., 2016), are black to brown humus layers deposited in acidic waters that are poor in nutrients and have high concentrations of soluble organic compounds. Such organic deposits have a gel-like form indicative of an abundance of amorphous organic matter. Small amounts of residues from plants associated with acidic environments, such as Sphagnum and other mosses, can be found. Those forms of dy having a dark glassy appearance and conchoidal fracture correspond to dopplerite (see Fig. 6H).

Gyttja (or eutrophic mud) forms in subaqueous environments rich in nutrients. It is defined as fine-textured, plastic, often gelatinous material when wet but becomes hard when dry, as the material shrinks and cracks along horizontal planes (Kroetsch et al., 2011). Gyttja (Fig. 11G and H) consists largely of droppings, diatoms and residues of aquatic animals, accumulated as loosely stacked particles and aggregates (Babel, 1975; Jongerius & Rutherford, 1979). Plant residues are commonly derived from algae, but remains of rooted plants of the shore vegetation are also often observed. In thin sections, the organic materials in gyttja are yellow (Kubiëna, 1953). Gyttja layers are referred to as

sedimentaryary peat, coprogenous earth or limnic materials in Soil Taxonomy (see Fox, 1985; Soil Survey Staff, 2014). Few studies have examined gyttja under the microscope (e.g., Uggla et al., 1972; Fox & Tarnocai, 1990). Fox & Tarnocai (1990) reported that the composition of sedimentary peat from a Pacific temperate wetland was dominated by amorphous organic matter, besides recognisable diatoms and plant tissues. At high magnification, the amorphous organic matter was identified as being composed largely of diatoms frustule fragments and organic remains with cell structure.

Sapropels are subaqueous layers formed at the bottom of nutrient-rich waters under anaerobic conditions. They can develop from gyttja or accumulate on top of the latter. Sapropels contain various amounts of more or less recognisable organic debris, and they are often highly enriched in sulphides, occurring as Fe-monosulphides or pyrite. Colours of sapropel horizons in the field are typically black, changing to grey upon drying. In marine settings, sea grasses such as Zostera spp. may provide considerable amounts of plant residues and tissues to surface and near-surface sapropel horizons (Babel, 1975; Bradley & Stolt, 2006; Blume et al., 2016). In marine intertidal zones, organic layers may also contain shell fragments, algae and remains of higher plants. Pseudomorphs after organic matter, composed of carbonates, iron sulphides, iron oxides and manganese oxides, are commonly encountered (Kooistra, 1978).

# 5.6 Anthropogenic Histosols

Deposits with high organic matter content that accumulate through anthropogenic activities may develop in waterlogged environments. Those sediments usually are not comparable with Anthrosols, which are characterised by long-term human impact and are described as human-altered or human-transported soils, mainly formed by irrigation or cultivation (Osman, 2013; Kooistra, 2015; see also Adderley et al., 2018). We prefer to allocate them to Histosols and not organic Anthrosols, as their genesis is much more comparable with that of natural waterlogged soils, such as peat soils (see below Section 5). Anthropogenic Histosols are found not only, for example, in Neolithic and Bronze Age lakeside settlements of Europe but also in urban areas near rivers or lakes (Kenward & Hall, 2000; Ismail-Meyer et al., 2013; Ismail-Meyer, 2014). Such accumulations may contain different types of organic remains, such as wood chips, charcoal, ash, bones, leather, woven fabrics, different coprolites, moss, grass, needles, leaves, seeds and shells

with probable roots showing interference colours  $(>)$ .

(F) Idem in XPL, showing that only the epidermis and central veins of the spruce needles display interference colours. (G) Calcareous gyttja containing altered leaves (a), a probable root (b), shells and moss stems (anthropogenic deposit, Jelsum, The Netherlands) (PPL). (H) Idem in XPL, clearly showing the presence of gastropod and ostracod shells  $(>)$ , as well as some degraded moss stems (a). Images (A) to (D), (G) and (H) by H. Huisman; images (E) and (F) by K. Ismail-Meyer.

(Fig. 12). The origin of such accumulations can be diverse, including house constructions (wood, bark, grass or peat sods), animal husbandry (twigs, leaves and grasses in connection with herbivore and omnivore coprolites), and harvesting, tillage and hunting activities (seeds, fruits, bones, possibly shells) (e.g., Guttmann et al., 2003; Huisman et al., 2009; Verrill & Tipping, 2010; Ismail-Meyer et al., 2013; Ismail-Meyer, 2014; Huisman & Milek, 2017; Bronnimann et al., 2017a, 2017b). In terms of formation and degradation processes, these accumulations can be compared with natural wetland soils, with the difference that accretion of organic matter was not natural but anthropogenic. The organic layers of anthropogenic Histosols can correspond to fibric, hemic or sapric horizons (Fig. 12; see also Section 5). The sediments may be reworked by running water, contain fluvial or limnic intercalations or can be overprinted by ripening during phases of lower water table (Fig. 12E and F). Because of erosion and breaks in sedimentation, contrasting layers can accumulate in succession, forming complex stratigraphic sequences. Thick anthropogenic layers can be produced in settings with high sedimentation rates (up to several centimetres per year) and short periods of settlement. They therefore represent brief events, not comparable with a normal peat soil formation with accumulation rates of  $0.01 - 3.8\mathrm{mm}$  per year (Kroetsch et al., 2011; Ismail-Meyer et al., 2013).

# 6. Organic Pedofeatures in Mineral Horizons

Organic pedofeatures commonly observed in thin sections of mineral horizons include excrements, infillings, coatings and nodules. Illuvial horizons rich in soil organic matter, occurring as pedofeatures, include spodic (e.g., De Coninck & McKeague, 1985; Bardy et al., 2008; Coelho et al., 2012), placic (Hseu et al., 1999) and humilluvian materials (van Heuveln & De Bakker, 1972). Detailed information about the micromorphology of spodic and placic materials is provided in the reviews by Wilson and Righi (2010) and Van Ranst et al. (2018). Illuvial organic material, sometimes referred to as illuvial humus, accumulates at the base of some drained and cultivated acidic organic soils (Soil Survey Staff, 2014). These illuvial horizons generally occur near the contact with underlying sandy materials. Such illuvial organic materials have only been identified in a few soils; thus little is known regarding their nature (Fox, 1985).

Excrements can be dispersed in mineral horizons or occur in groups, typically within pores or associated with plant remains (see Kooistra & Pulleman, 2018). The source of soil organic matter that was ingested and the type of soil fauna will primarily determine whether the excrements are composed of organic fine material or contain plant residues, the latter potentially including some that can be identified by tissue type. Excrements containing recognisable plant residues, produced by soil macrofauna such as earthworms, are often consumed again by soil mesofauna, such as potworms. Description and discussion of the genesis of excrements is presented by Kooistra & Pulleman (2018).

Soils can contain infillings that are composed of a variety of soil organic matter basic components, including plant residues and organic fine materials (Kooistra et al., 2006), although such infillings are a less common type of soil organic matter pedofeatures than excrements. In agricultural soils that are well populated with earthworms, these infillings are common in unplowed near-surface horizons (Ligthart, 1997). In contrast, Blazejewski et al. (2005) found that infillings were the least common OM-rich pedofeatures found in subsurface horizons of hydric riparian (streamside) soils and the few that were observed were directly below A horizons or buried surface horizons.

Coatings composed of soil organic matter occur in several forms. One of the most common types of coating is associated with coarse grains, in a chitonic c/f-related distribution pattern, as in spodic horizons. Detailed descriptions of these coatings and their genesis are provided elsewhere (see Van Ranst et al., 2018). Other types of organic matter coatings include coatings in channels, resulting from earthworm activity. Worms moving through the soils create channels and leave exudates along the channel walls that may be rich in organic carbon (Kretzschmar, 1987; Blackwell et al., 1990; Binet & Curmi, 1992; Babel & Kretzschmar, 1994). Ligthart (1997) found that earthworm channels at shallow depths  $(< 22\mathrm{cm})$  lacked coatings, in contrast to channels at greater depths in the same profile. However, earthworm-related coatings have also been observed at deeper levels in soils (Kretzschmar, 1987). Coatings rich in organic matter are also often observed along ped surfaces of gleyed horizons (Bg or Btg). Some illuvial clay coatings are rich in organic matter pigment or amorphous fine material (see Kuhn et al., 2018).

Irregular impregnative (non-cemented) nodules rich in organic matter have been described in some studies. They are sometimes clearly associated with incipient or incomplete spodic horizon formation (Macphail, 1983; Blazejewski et al., 2005), but in other cases the apparent genetic process cannot be identified. These nodules are often found in the same horizons as other organic matter features; thus a number of different pathways for their formation may exist. Based on the observation that these nodules, together with roots, were the most abundant features or components rich in organic matter, Blazejewski et al. (2005) suggested that they formed primarily by transformation of roots. This transformation involves a series of decomposition steps, from a fibrous root into a root trace (decomposed root that still maintains the orientation and dimensions of the original root), into a barely recognisable soil organic matter aggregate and finally into an irregular impregnative nodule (see Fig. 5). Other processes involved in the formation of these features may include pedoturbation (Hole, 1961; Johnson et al., 1987; Peacock & Fant, 2002) and illuviation (Fanning & Fanning, 1989).

# 7. Organic Sedimentary Features

In environments where deposition is a major process, such as floodplains, footslopes and alluvial fans, layered sediments indicative of water deposition are often encountered at various depths in the profile. These layers, referred to as lenses here, contain a range of

soil organic materials from various sources and range in thickness from millimetres to a few centimetres (e.g., Kooistra, 1978; Kooistra et al., 1989, 2006; Macphail et al., 2003; Blazejewski et al., 2005). Samples can include several parallel layers of this type. Some of these layers are composed almost entirely of plant residues, whereas most are dominated by organic fine materials or pigments. In sandy materials, organic matter is primarily associated with fine organomineral aggregates that occur between coarse grains (enaulic c/f-related distribution pattern). In fine-textured soils, organic matter is so intimately associated with the silt and clay particles that differentiating between amorphous, fine organic materials and pigments is difficult. Boundaries between lenses rich in organic matter and those strata containing much less carbon are typically prominent. Their limited thickness, abrupt boundaries, abundance of plant residues and parallel orientation and distribution relative to the soil surface suggest that the lenses formed during short periods of land surface stability.

# 8. Applications and Conclusions

Some of the most important issues that soil scientists face are related to the effects of land-use change, global warming, pollution and invasive species on the soil environment. Because soil organic matter is the most dynamic of all soil components, effects of changing soil environment are often recorded first in the quality and distribution of organic matter. Thin sections provide a window to directly view these changes in soils at mesoscopic and microscopic scales.

Understanding changes relative to anthropogenic activities and the effects of cultivation, erosion, sedimentation, ground raising, compaction, waste deposition and fire may require integrative approaches using micromorphology, macrobotanical analyses, palynology and palynofacies analyses, possibly supplemented by molluscs, insect and diatom analyses, to interpret the form and distribution of soil organic matter, as well as to understand natural and anthropogenic soil formation processes (Kooistra & Kooistra, 2003; Sebag et al., 2006; Kuhn et al., 2013). These plant and animal remains can be useful, for instance, in establishing the succession of changes in natural communities and understanding land-use changes. Wood fibres, cereal pollen and grains representing allochthonous organic matter can be used to identify the depth of anthropogenic activity.

Another important marker for anthropogenic activity is black carbon, especially charcoal (Masiello, 2004). Numerous studies have used micromorphology and the occurrence and distribution of charcoal to understand anthropogenic occupation and activities (e.g., Courty et al., 1989; Macphail et al., 1990; Davidson, 2002; Stephens et al., 2005; Macphail & Crowther, 2007). Fine black carbon (soot) in the atmosphere may be responsible for climate change in certain regions (McConnell et al., 2007; Ramanathan & Carmichael, 2008), and it can also be a significant sink of carbon in the global cycle (Kuhlbusch, 1998; Dai et al., 2005). Future micromorphological research may assist in

understanding deposition rates of black carbon relative to global change and warming, and carbon turnover and storage.

Land-use change, global warming and atmospheric deposition of  $\mathbf{N}$  may contribute to increased soil organic matter turnover rates such that carbon stocks in soils decrease and consequently  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  concentrations in the atmosphere increase. Records of soil organic matter quality, its spatial distribution and its position relative to mineral components may assist in understanding soil organic carbon and  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  responses to these changes. For example, soil horizons with lignin- or phlobaphene-rich materials, resistant to decomposition, will have slower turnover rates and thus will not be affected as much by environmental change. Turnover rates of soil organic matter may also be slowed by occlusion within aggregates and by intercalation or interaction with the mineral fraction or metals (Lützow et al., 2006). Understanding the spatial distribution of the organic matter in the soil and the interactions with mineral components may assist in understanding which soils will be more prone to higher turnover rates than others.

The distribution of soil organic matter in profiles such as moders and annoors is the result of soil, plant, mesofauna and microfauna interactions. Soil micromorphology provides a tool to observe these interrelationships and to understand ecosystem processes (Ponge, 2003).

# 1. Introduction

Three concepts and associated terms are used in soil science to indicate the organomineral surface horizons: (i) topsoil, the most general term used by the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006, 2015; see also Spaargaren, 1998); (ii) epipedon, used in Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 1999) for diagnostic organo-mineral horizons complementary to subsoil horizons; and (iii) humus forms introduced by Kubiëna (1938) and widely used by micromorphologists. Kubiëna (1953) gives clear and comprehensive definitions of 17 humus forms, which were later subdivided into narrower categories, mostly by pedologists in France (e.g., Duchaufour, 1959, 1960; Baize & Girard, 1995; Jabiol et al., 1995) and Russia (Chertov, 1966).

Micromorphologists followed Kubiëna's ideas, either extending them over broader sets of soils (Jongerius & Marsman, 1971; Kowalinski & Kollender-Szych, 1972; Parfenova & Yarilova, 1977; Romashkevich & Gerasimova, 1982) or proposing alternative systems that refer more to the properties of organic matter in the surface horizons than to the horizons themselves (Barratt, 1964; Bal, 1970). At present, organic components are described in micromorphology strictly according to their properties (Bullock et al., 1985; Stoops, 2003), whose combinations serve as a basis for characterising organic soil horizons (Stolt & Lindbo, 2010; Ismail-Meyer et al., 2018).

This chapter summarises the micromorphological characteristics of organo-mineral surface horizons of natural soils, weakly or not subjected to human influence. Topsoils with prominent anthropogenic features are referred to in another chapter (Adderley et al., 2018). Most of the horizons considered here occur as part of soils on unconsolidated parent materials such as loess and clays, in which manifestations of pedogenesis are easily observed.

Special attention is given to mollic diagnostic horizon with typical mull humus of steppe, forest-steppe and prairie soils, and its variants under more humid or more arid climatic conditions, or in particular geomorphological settings. Also considered are umbric horizons, which mainly form in rather humid and cool climate under deciduous forests (e.g., southern taiga and mountainous forest). In addition to the organo-mineral surface horizons mentioned above, intervals with takyric and yermic properties (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015), corresponding roughly to the former takyric and yermic diagnostic horizons (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006), are also discussed. Both properties are specific of desert areas and are essentially determined by the mineral solid phase. In contrast to other topsoils, organic constituents and biological activity are of minor importance. Takyric properties occur in periodically flooded soils of arid regions and comprise a surface crust above a platy structured layer. Yermic properties usually comprise residual surface accumulations of rock fragments, the so-called desert pavement, embedded in a loamy vesicular crust and covered by a thin layer of aeolian sand or silt. Comprehensive descriptions of the micromorphology of aridic soils were given by Allen (1985), Lebedeva-Verba and Gerasimova (2009) and Lebedeva et al. (2013). The micromorphology of desert topsoils has been reported in several publications by Russian authors (e.g., Feofarova, 1956; Romashkevich & Gerasimova, 1982; Gubin, 1984; Golovanov et al., 2005; Gerasimova & Lebedeva, 2008; Lebedeva et al., 2015).

The organo-mineral soils discussed in this chapter were chosen to illustrate the idea of soil diversity in terms of micromorphological properties, with emphasis on zonal soils of the temperate climate. Less attention was paid to forest soils to avoid overlapping with the description of humus forms (see Ismail-Meyer et al., 2018). However, overlap with the chapters on faunal activity (Kooistra & Pulleman, 2018), organic matter (Ismail-Meyer et al., 2018) and surface crusts (Williams et al., 2018) are sometimes inevitable. WRB terminology (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015) will be used throughout this chapter; if correlation with WRB terms is ambiguous, soil names according to the

Russian classification systems (Cooperative Research Group of Chinese Soil Taxonomy, 2001; Shishov et al., 2004) are also reported for Russian examples.

To cover the diversity of surface horizons within the above-mentioned groups, we use the concept of orthotype, which applies to a horizon with the most typical and well-developed micromorphological characteristics, may it be a real horizon in a specific soil profile or a generalised set of the most conspicuous and recurring properties. Orthotypes reflect the typical results of pedogenic processes in certain environments. They more or less correspond to the concepts of higher levels of organisation (Stoops, 1994), or micromorphotypes and central images (Gerasimova, 2003). Deviations of micromorphological properties from those inherent to the orthotype indicate changes in pedogenic processes that produced horizons with similar basic properties but with some different and/or additional features (variants). In WRB, qualifiers are used to record such minor modifications of the orthotype. In the Russian soil classification system, they correspond to 'diagnostic properties', identifying the subtype level, which are soil types with additional or less expressed features than in the main type.

# 2. Organo-mineral Surface Horizons of Soils of Temperate Climates

# 2.1 General Features

Particular combinations of soil-forming factors, including loess-like parent material, easily decomposable litter, high biological activity, favourable soil moisture and temperature regimes, explain the micromorphological properties that are inherent to the majority of organo-mineral surface horizons in soils of temperate climates. These properties have been described for a broad set of soils, such as soddy-podzolic soils (Albeluvisols, Retisols), forest-steppe and steppe soils (Phaeozems and Chernozems), and are summarised below.

The microstructure is most commonly granular and crumb; in addition, elements of platy or lenticular microstructure have been observed for frost-affected soils. The aggregates being moderately to highly separated, the total void space is large in the majority of these topsoils. Packing voids are dominant, vugs may occur, and channels and chambers are less abundant. The main processes responsible for microstructure development are faunal activity (see Kooistra & Pulleman, 2010, 2018), root growth, coagulation, binding by organic substances (see Stolt & Lindbo, 2010; Ismail-Meyer et al., 2018) and ice crystal formation due to seasonal frost (see Van Vliet-Lanoë, 2010; Van Vliet-Lanoë & Fox, 2018).

The groundmass is mostly homogeneous. The c/f-related distribution pattern varies, although porphyric types are the most common. The micromass has a speckled or dotted limpidity and generally an undifferentiated or stipple-speckled b-fabric owing to the masking effect of organic compounds. Compared with other horizons, organo-mineral surface horizons are the most strongly affected by present-day pedogenesis and

the first to reflect changes in environmental conditions. Being the main habitat of biota in the soil, organo-mineral surface horizons contain plant residues in various stages of alteration. The type of alteration and the properties of the organic fine material reflect the intensity and conditions of humus accumulation.

Except for excrements and passage features, few pedofeatures are observed. Earthworm activity is of primary interest as being responsible for microstructure development. The contribution of earthworms is well known and universally accepted since the time of Darwin (e.g., Kubiëna, 1938; Jeanson, 1964; Bal, 1973; FitzPatrick, 1984, 2006; Kretzschmar, 1987; Jabiol et al., 1995; Brown et al., 2003; Kooistra & Pulleman, 2010, 2018). Other mesofauna groups are common, such as oribatid mites and potworms in surface horizons of forest soils with moder or mull-moder humus forms (Zachariae, 1964; Bal, 1973; Babel & Vogel, 1989). In addition, organo-mineral surface horizons may contain loose infillings of channels and packing voids with extraneous material, mostly in the form of non-aggregated fine silt that is different from the enclosing groundmass. These infillings probably result from deposition, in large open voids, of fine material that was loosened and transported by surface water during rainstorms or that was added to the surface by wind.

Relic features preserved from earlier periods of pedogenesis, such as nodules, coatings and crystals, are uncommon in surface horizons, unless they are either transported (e.g., by colluvial processes) or part of a truncated soil.

# 2.2 Mollic and Chernic Horizons

Mollic horizons are part of the profile of a broad spectrum of soils, although they are most typical for chernozems. In the most recent version of the WRB system (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015), the chernic horizon was introduced, in which the most prominent characteristics of mollic are clearly manifested. It is identified by higher organic matter content and lower chroma than the mollic horizon and by a strongly developed granular structure. In the majority of Russian chernozems, under both forest-steppe and steppe vegetation, the uppermost part of the mollic horizon may be identified as chernic.

The humus form in mollic and chernic horizons is mull, eumull (Baize & Girard, 1995), 'well-developed terrestrial mull' (Kubiëna, 1938, 1970) or calcic mull (Chertov, 1966; Romashkevich & Gerasimova, 1982). The major micromorphological features have been comprehensively described for North American Chernozems (Pawluk & Bal, 1985; Sanborn & Pawluk, 1989; Eswaran & Drees, 2004; Kovda et al., 2004). There are also many publications on Russian and Ukrainian Chernozems (e.g., Tselishcheva, 1966; Yarilova, 1972, 1974; Yarilova & Bystritskaya, 1976; Parfenova & Yarilova, 1977; Poliakov, 1981; Yarilova et al., 1983; Bystritskaya & Gerasimova, 1988; Khitrov et al., 2013). A review of the micromorphological properties of mollic horizons was presented by FitzPatrick (1984).

# 2.2.1 Orthotype

The upper part of typical mollic horizons, often corresponding to a chernic horizon, has a well-developed, highly separated complex crumb microstructure (Fig. 1A) and abundant channels. The peds are mostly organo-mineral excrements of various sizes, generally between 0.1 and  $0.5\mathrm{mm}$  but occasionally up to  $1\mathrm{mm}$ . They are mostly arranged in clusters, for which a three-level hierarchy can be recognised. Channel infillings composed of earthworm excrements (Fig. 1B), either separate or coalesced, are common, and a vermicular microstructure is often dominant. According to Poliakov (1981), the upper  $0.5\mathrm{m}$  of chernozem profiles is at least five times fully reworked by earthworms. In the lower part of the topsoil, the aggregates are less separated, and the microstructure is a result of ageing and coalescence of earthworm excrements (Fig. 1C). Associated voids are mostly vugs, channels and chambers. Passage features are common. The described crumb, vermicular and spongy microstructures basically correspond to the 'spongy fabric' of Poliakov (1981) and Pazos and Stoops (1987) and to the 'mullgranic' and 'mullgranoidic' microstructures of Pawluk and Bal (1985).

The groundmass is homogeneous, generally with a close porphyric c/f-related distribution pattern, as the majority of Chernozems occur on loess or loess-like materials. The micromass is dark brown and dotted, because of fine organic material occurring as punctuations, with almost always undifferentiated b-fabric, which confirms the close association between organic and mineral fine material, one of the important mull humus characteristics. Few fresh plant residues, consisting of light yellowish parenchymatic root tissues with distinct interference colours, occur in channels.

Earthworm excrements are mostly spheroidal and mammilated, coalescing by ageing, porous to very porous and composed of the same material as the groundmass with minor admixtures of tissue fragments. Some excrements containing material from lower horizons can be identified as aggregates with a different colour and b-fabric than the groundmass (Fig. 1D and E). The degree of distinctness of their boundaries and contrast with the enclosing material indicate the stage of their assimilation into the groundmass of the surface horizon. This process can play an important role in maintaining the calcium carbonate equilibrium and provides the stability of the microstructure of a typical mollic or chernic horizon.

# 2.2.2 Variants

Variants have either additional or modified micromorphological features, which reflect different environments (climate, drainage conditions, parent material) and which are complementary to the main properties of the orthotype. The first three variants that are considered in this section (greyzemic, hydromorphic, lenticular/platy) basically correspond to surface horizons of Chernozems and Phaeozems. The next series of variants represent horizons in other Reference Soil Groups.

Greyzemic variant - Circular or semicircular arrangement of silt grains in the groundmass (Fig. 2) was observed for chernic horizons of Greyzemic Luvic Chernozems (Yarilova et al., 1983) and Greyzemic Luvic Phaeozems (Miedema et al., 1999). This

feature is interpreted as having formed by the removal of fine material from the periphery of former crumbs or granules, which next became hardly recognisable through coalescence or disturbance. This variant corresponds to leached mollic material below the chernic horizon, mostly in forest-steppe soils. In terms of soil classification, this feature identifies Chernozems as Greyzemic and/or Luvic in the current WRB system, or as a podzolised subtype of clay-illuvial chernozem in the current Russian system.

Hydromorphic variant - Dark typic (orthic) nodules composed of iron oxides with admixture of organic matter (Fig. 3) have been encountered in organo-mineral surface horizons of Phaeozems of the Far Eastern plains (Gerasimova et al., 1996). Iron-depletion hypocoatings and light brown limpid non-laminated clay coatings around nodules and aggregates, described for Gleyic Phaeozems of the Amur River terraces (Gyninova & Shoba, 1988), suggest present-day mobilisation of iron and weak clay illuviation. Similar pedofeatures were reported for some Chernozems of European Russia with active hydromorphism (Yarilova et al., 1983), and for Luvian Phaeozems of small depressions in the Caspian semidesert (Verba et al., 2006). These pedofeatures of the hydromorphic variant reflect short periods of waterlogging.

Lenticular/platy variant - Crumbs arranged into wavy plates that form lenticular or platy microstructures (Fig. 4), typical of soils subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, have been reported for North American mollic horizons (Mermut & St. Arnaud, 1981; Sanborn & Pawluk, 1989). Pawluk and Bal (1985) described 'banded' cryic microstructures for A1-horizons of soils in the forest-grassland transition zone and interpreted them as degraded mollic horizons. In Russia, similar features were recorded for forest-steppe grey soils (Mollic Luvisols) (Gerasimova et al., 1996; Miedema et al., 1999). Another

type of platy microstructure with welded round aggregates, forming partially accommodated plates, may form in depressions, as a result of the strong lateral runoff in spring that leads to the transport and deposition of granular or crumb aggregates. This is the case for the mollic horizon of Luvian Phaeozems in large 'steppe saucers' in the Caspian Lowland (Verba et al., 2006).

Melanic variant - A rather compact and very dark micromass is typical of mollic horizons of Phaeozems of the Argentinean Pampa (Pazos & Stoops, 1987). These horizons are characterised by intense biological activity. Compared with the orthotype, they contain less excremental pedofeatures and much more abundant organic pigment and have weakly developed microstructure (unpublished work by the authors). Dark coatings on coarse grains and abundant dark opaque amorphous aggregates  $(50 - 100\mu \mathrm{m})$  (Fig. 5) have been observed as well. The latter are probably remnants of volcanic glass, which is known to be abundant in Pampean soils (Moscatelli & Pazos, 2000). The differences with the orthotype can be mostly attributed to the admixture of volcanic material, which can require an 'andic' qualifier.

Kastanozem variant - The mollic horizon of Kastanozems (Chestnut soils) of dry steppes (Medvedev, 1983; Gracheva et al., 1988) shows a more compact arrangement of the granular aggregates, with moderate to weak ped separation and few to common secondary peds, a total void space (vugs and channels) of less than  $20\%$  by volume, a lighter grey-brown colour of the micromass (lower content of organic matter content) and more diverse and abundant plant residues, owing to a shorter period available for decomposition. Traces of faunal activity are less abundant (Fig. 6). The Kastanozem variant is not very close to the orthotype, but it meets the requirements for mollic, which confirms its diagnostic significance for Kastanozems.

Serozem variant - This carbonate-enriched variant of the mollic horizon occurs in Calcisols on loess (serozems). It was first described by Minashina (1966) as strongly reworked by soil fauna and having preserved loess-inherited properties such as high pedality and high porosity, dominated by vesicles. The organic carbon content is  $1.5\mathrm{-}3.5\%$  and the organic matter is bound to the mineral soil constituents, which also

justifies qualifying this topsoil as calcic mull. Aggregates are weakly to moderately separated, mostly rounded and not accommodated. They coalesce to create a sponge-like microstructure with various types of voids (packing voids, vesicles, channels, chambers, vugs) (Fig. 7). The micromass is greyish pale brown with a weak stipple-speckled and/or calcitic crystallitic b-fabric. It differs from the mollic horizons of

Chernozems by colour, b-fabric and a greater abundance of channels and other passage features. The similarity in microstructure between this variant and the orthotype can be explained by the prominent contribution of soil fauna, whose excrements in serozems, although less numerous than in chernozems, are better preserved owing to the semiarid climate.

Rendzic variant - This limestone-derived variant essentially corresponds to the 'rendzina fabric' of Kubiëna (1938). The microstructure is subangular blocky rather than crumb, granular or vermicular. The dark brown coarse aggregates  $(0.2 - 0.5\mathrm{mm})$  are weakly accommodated and have undulating to rough boundaries. The proportion of aggregates related to faunal origin strongly varies. The high porosity, resulting in low moisture content due to the excessive aeration, together with the great abundance of rock fragments seems to be the limiting factor for soil animal activity, recorded by the low abundance of excrement pedofeatures. Tissue residues are strongly altered, with deformed dark brown lignified walls only partly preserved (Kowalinski et al., 1972). The b-fabric is generally undifferentiated and locally weakly developed calcitic-crystallitic. Occurrences of the latter b-fabric type correspond to small zones presumably adjacent to dissolving fragments of the calcareous parent rock (Fig. 8), which are an essential component of the groundmass (Wilding et al., 1997).

Plowed variant - This variant is common among mollic topsoils, and its properties vary more in relation to field management practices than to natural factors. Under continuous low-input farming (e.g., limited fertilisation, plowing irrespective of soil moisture status, use of heavy machines), the topsoil hardly qualifies as mollic or chernic. Extreme cases of undue management may result in strong compaction, plow pan formation, sealing and development of vertic features. Some of these features may

disappear after several years of no-till practices or abandonment. The effect of traditional farming on the microstructure of chernozems is usually rather modest. The main effects are a decrease in porosity and a change in aggregate shape. The resulting microstructure is dominated by rounded, elongated or irregular coarse aggregates with uneven boundaries that are better accommodated. Many of them are former coprolites and may be identified as part of a rather compact soil material or as part of channel infillings. The volume of packing voids is smaller and few fine planes are present (Fig. 9). Preservation of microstructure is considered to be a prerequisite for the restoration of initial properties of mollic and chernic horizons following favourable changes in land use or climate (Bystritskaya & Gerasimova, 1988).

# 2.3 Umbric Horizon

Morphologically, the umbric horizon has much in common with the mollic horizon: it is dark, rich in organic matter, rather thick, and it has a strong to medium crumb structure. It is set apart from the mollic horizon by lower base saturation (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015), and it typically also has a lower pH. Unlike the mollic horizon, it has a limited geographical occurrence, confined to deciduous forests of regions with a cool climate.

The umbric horizon is diagnostic for the Umbrisols in WRB, and umbric is a qualifier in other Reference Soil Groups. Only few micromorphological descriptions of the umbric horizon are available, and only its orthotype is discussed here. It is based on studies, by the authors, of Umbrisols, or Umbric Leptosols of the Altay Mountains in Southern Siberia and Khentey Mountains in Mongolia.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/5501161a-5c4f-4e7e-80ad-cb00b3b22133/838b17a1cc5c79ed49d21b751ff32ee3012ada610a5e4f6a58a20aa8296fc597.jpg)

The crumb microstructure of umbric horizon is moderately developed with weakly separated peds. In some coarser aggregates ( $>1\mathrm{mm}$ ), finer aggregates ( $<0.5\mathrm{mm}$ ) that are welded together are discernible (Fig. 10A). The outlines of the welded aggregates are indistinct and rugose. They consist of organo-mineral material and contain numerous fine voids. Packing voids between the coarse aggregates are few, and some associated vugs are present. Traces of faunal activity are limited to intact and coalesced earthworm excrements, occurring as infillings. Few residues of yellowish brown parenchymatic root tissues are found in the groundmass. These residues seem to be fragmented, possibly by frost. The groundmass is homogeneous, generally with a close porphyric c/f-related distribution pattern. The micromass is dusky brown to black with many fine organic punctuations, which display a trend to ring-like patterns. The b-fabric is undifferentiated (Fig. 10B).

The described micromorphological features of the umbric horizon confirm that, despite some common properties, it differs from the mollic orthotype by lower biological activity, more weakly developed microstructure and evidence of frost action.

# 3. Organo-mineral Surface Horizons of Desert Soils

Organo-mineral surface horizons of desert soils have a distinct set of common properties. The horizons are extremely shallow, being only a few centimetres thick. A very thin layer (0.5-1 cm) of wind-blown sand is commonly present above a more compact material, recording the contribution of aeolian processes (Lobova, 1967; Dregne, 1976; Souirji, 1991). Moreover, even in sandy desert soils (Arenosols) of Turkmenia, the thin surface layer of fine sand is continuously moved by wind, thus protecting the tender roots of ephemeral grasses from direct irradiation (Lobova, 1967).

The recent change in taxonomic position of intervals with takyric and yermic properties is of minor importance with regard to their micromorphological characteristics, as reviewed by Lebedeva-Verba and Gerasimova (2010), because the orthotypes remain distinct. In the definitions of both diagnostic properties (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015), aridic properties are now an obligatory criterion, implying low organic matter content, evidence of aeolian activity, light colour and high base saturation (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015).

Takyric properties occur in aridic, periodically flooded soils and comprise the presence of a surface crust above the layer with platy structure. Yermic properties usually comprise the occurrence of surface accumulations of rock fragments, the so-called desert pavement, embedded in a loamy vesicular crust and covered by a thin layer of aeolian sand or silt. A comprehensive description of the micromorphology of aridic soils was given by Allen (1985). The micromorphology of desert topsoils has been reported in several publications by Russian authors (e.g., Feofarova, 1956; Romashkevich & Gerasimova, 1982; Gubin, 1984; Golovanov et al., 2005; Gerasimova & Lebedeva, 2008; Lebedeva (Verba) et al., 2009; Lebedeva et al., 2015). In recent years, the interest of micromorphologists in desert soils has shifted towards studies of vesicular crusts and mechanisms of their formation (Lebedeva-Verba & Kutovaya, 2013; Lebedeva et al., 2013; Turk & Graham, 2014).

# 3.1 Intervals With Takyric Properties

Intervals with takyric properties (typically  $2 - 6\mathrm{cm}$  thick) have a clear and limited set of micromorphological characteristics, which were first described by Feofarova (1956) for takyrs of southwestern Turkmenia. Subsequent research allowed specifying the micromorphological properties of takyrs with respect to the stages of their evolution (Romashkevich & Gerasimova, 1982; Gerasimova, 2003). These stages were described for southwestern Turkmenistan by Lavrov et al. (1976) and named after the associated successive plant communities: abiotic, algal and lichen stages, followed by degraded takyr with some higher plants. The orthotype may be regarded as representing the lichen stage of takyr development in Lavrov's evolution sequence, whereas two variants represent the early and final stages.

# 3.1.1 Orthotype

The takyric orthotype is characterised by a homogeneous, apedal, salt-free, clayey groundmass, with few to many vesicles and few planes. The c/f-related distribution pattern is mostly fine monic, with coarse mineral grains generally confined to infillings of planar voids. The micromass is yellowish brown to light brown with mainly calcitic crystallitic b-fabric (Fig. 11) and locally stipple-speckled b-fabric. Very few limpid, non-laminated clay coatings or fragments of clay coatings have been reported. Their occurrence has been described in terms of 'epi-illuvial argillification' for Chinese takyr soils (Cao Chenggeng, 1990). Organic constituents are rare or absent and may be

fragments of lichens blown into fissures. The presence of a thin discontinuous surface layer of wind-transported fine sand (less than  $0.5\mathrm{cm}$  thick) has been mentioned for a number of takyrs (Fedoroff & Courty, 1987). Such deposits can become buried, resulting in the presence of sand layers.

# 3.1.2 Variants

The algal variant represents an earlier stage than the orthotype, starting after deposition of clayey material in depressions or playas. It survives a few weeks of waterlogging in spring, allowing development of algae and abundant zooplankton (Bazilevich & Rodin, 1956). Morphologically, algal deposits are identified by a grayish blue or greenish thin  $(<0.5\mathrm{cm})$  discontinuous films with curling edges (Fig. 12A). Such films, both on the surface and embedded in the mineral groundmass, are observed in thin sections at high magnification as consisting of blue-green algae (cyanobacteria), occurring as algal filaments with high birefringence, mixed with micritic calcite aggregates (Fig. 12B). Besides algae, other manifestations of microbiota include small  $(5\mu \mathrm{m})$ , rounded or oval, dark brown, semitransparent biogenic bodies and flakes. The c/f-related distribution pattern is fine monic, but silt and fine sand grains occur in thin bands, with mica plates displaying a subparallel orientation. The micromass is yellowish brown to light brown with mainly crystallitic b-fabric (Fig. 12B) and locally stipple-speckled b-fabric. The microstructure is massive with few planes and closed equant pores in the compact groundmass. These testify to periodical and strong effects of living organisms on the takyr fabric (Lebedeva-Verba & Gerasimova, 2010). The filamentous cyanobacteria are assumed to maintain the stability of the crust on the soil surface, contributing to better cohesion of

the mineral mass and to dust accumulation (Pagliai & Stoops, 2010; Williams et al., 2018).

The degraded variant, or takyr of the final stage, is characterised by gradual incorporation of aeolian sand infillings into the groundmass. The boundaries of the infillings become gradually less distinct, and in older takyrs the former infillings are recognised only as linear features composed of aligned sand grains along former planes or clusters of sand grains filling former vesicles. The initial fine monic c/f-related distribution pattern becomes open porphyric (Fig. 13), some vesicles are transformed to vughs and a more open pore system is formed. Rare fragments of clay coatings with indistinct boundaries are impregnated by fine-grained calcite. The input of aeolian sand enhances the transformation of takyrs, which is also controlled by the changes in plant communities during alternating flooding stages and dry periods. When the amount of sand reaches a certain level, vesicular voids are transformed to vughs, and some of them become no longer closed. As a result, the surface horizon acquires certain water permeability, and water no longer stagnates on their surface in spring. These changes in moisture regime contribute to evolution of the pedon to another type of desert soil with residual takyric features (Lobova, 1967). Presumably, they gradually acquire yermic properties.

Comparing the orthotype and variants, it may be concluded that the micromorphological features of intervals with takyric properties are very conspicuous and that differences between them permit to decipher the history of these soils. The microfabric of each variant is indicative of its hydrological regime, which strongly depends on the shape and continuity of voids, including vesicles, which are further discussed in the next section.

# 3.2 Intervals With Yermic Properties

The most recent definition of yermic properties in WRB (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015) includes aridic properties as requirement (see Section 3.1) as well as the required presence of desert pavement (identified by desert varnish and presence of ventifacts) and/or a vesicular layer (either associated with the desert pavement or overlain by a thin platy layer). The components of the associated desert pavement are too large for standard thin section studies and are not discussed in this chapter.

The fine material of the intervals with yermic properties usually comprises two thin sublayers (microlayers of Boiffin and Bresson, 1987) that are a few centimetres thick: the vesicular sublayer and the platy sublayer (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006, 2015), with corresponding vesicular and platy microstructures (Fig. 14; see also Pagliai & Stoops, 2010; Williams et al., 2018). Both sublayers show prominent features of aeolian accumulation. In most cases, the vesicular sublayer is located on the top of the platy sublayer, but the opposite arrangement has also been recorded (Lebedeva (Verba) et al., 2009). The platy layer can also be absent in soils with desert pavement, as reported for Antarctic 'dry valleys' (Bockheim, 2010).

A layer with vesicular microstructure has been described for many desert soils (Springer, 1958; Evenari et al., 1974; McFadden et al., 1998; Romashkevich & Gerasimova, 1982; Figueira & Stoops, 1983; Gong Zitong & Gu Guoan, 1991; Gubin, 1984; Allen, 1985; Souirji, 1991; Anderson et al., 2002; Golovanov et al., 2005; Gerasimova & Lebedeva, 2008; Lebedeva & Shishkov, 2016). The vesicular sublayer is an important diagnostic element of intervals with yermic properties, corresponding to vesicular crusts, and it has been assumed to be genetically related to the desert pavement (see Pagliai & Stoops, 2010;

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/5501161a-5c4f-4e7e-80ad-cb00b3b22133/2dc239596f90aec96aafb3f883409ec4ec7d4da3ad526225f9057694eb3f9427.jpg)

Williams et al., 2018). The micromass of this sublayer is calcareous, with embedded fine sand-sized and silt-sized grains (open porphyric c/f-related distribution pattern) and calcitic crystallitic b-fabric (Fig. 15). Its most prominent feature is the presence of round, closed pores. This type of porosity can result in low water permeability, which can cause water stagnation for short periods after episodic rainstorms (Gorbunov & Bekarevich, 1955; Evenari et al., 1974). Investigating the hydrological function of vesicular microstructures was one of the reasons to apply new methods to the study of pore patterns, including X-ray computed tomography (Turk & Graham, 2011, 2014; Lebedeva et al., 2016). As illustrated by such studies, vesicular pores prevail in the upper part of the microhorizon, and their number decreases downward, sometimes merging to form interconnected voids, with equant voids becoming substituted by vugs. This trend may be attributed to deformation mechanisms caused by swelling-shrinking or by freeze-thaw cycles (Springer, 1958; see Van Vliet-Lanoë & Fox, 2018). The latter can apply to aridic soils with yermic properties of Central Asia, for which low temperatures have been reported (Pankova, 1992; Golovanov et al., 2005; Lebedeva (Verba) et al., 2009; Lebedeva et al., 2015; Pankova & Lebedeva, 2015).

Vesicular microstructures are considered to be rather stable owing to microlaminated clay coatings along pore walls (Sullivan & Koppi, 1991), or to stress-deformed clay around the vesicles (porostriated b-fabric). In hyperaridic soils of the Gobi desert, hypocoatings and coatings with partially disordered fabric were observed along the sides of vesicular voids (Fig. 16) (unpublished work by the authors).

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/5501161a-5c4f-4e7e-80ad-cb00b3b22133/ca892f4e4770fe082bcd18cf55ae24e89463d10487bb6f4b05c04445a35a0c1a.jpg)

Vesicular pores have been described for substrates that are quite different in terms of particle size distribution and carbonate content. In these different materials, the origin of vesicles may be different, while remaining related to trapping of a gas phase. Thus, for aridic soils of Ili Depression (Eastern Kazakhstan), with a highly calcareous silty groundmass, vesicle formation may be related to shifts in carbonate-bicarbonate equilibrium in response to moisture and temperature fluctuations during summer rains, promoting carbon dioxide emission (Lebedeva et al., 2015). In an extremely aridic soil of the Gobi Desert (Mongolia), with a sandy clay groundmass, aeolian material has been found as loose discontinuous infillings of vesicular pores, suggesting another way of vesicle development, presumably involving liberation of air from a strongly desiccated material caused by short intense summer rains.

In subboreal deserts, the vesicular layer is mostly underlain by a platy layer. The latter has a complex microstructure composed of aeolian rounded aggregates displaying a more or less strongly developed banded arrangement, producing a platy or lenticular microstructure, with subparallel voids (Fig. 17). These rounded aggregates vary in micromass properties, c/f-related distribution pattern and degree of separation. Their micromass has a calcitic crystallitic b-fabric, and calcareous nodules or fragments of nodules are frequently included in the groundmass. Frost action has probably contributed to the platy rearrangement of the rounded aggregates.

In the majority of intervals with yermic properties, plant residues are scarce. Few traces of faunal activity are encountered as rather dense yellowish limpid spheroidal organo-mineral excrements. Pedozooologists have reported an abundance of Isopoda in aridic soils (Striganova, 1996).

# 4. Conclusions

Organo-mineral surface horizons are more sensitive to environmental conditions and changes than other parts of soil profiles. This is reflected in thin sections by the presence of characteristic microstructures, organic matter types and features related to faunal activity.

The orthotype of the mollic horizon, coinciding with the recently named 'chernic horizon' (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015), corresponds to steppe chernozemic mull and has been the subject of many micromorphological studies. Variants of this orthotype occur in a broad spectrum of soils, mostly under grasslands of boreal or subtropical steppes, meadows and prairies. The micromorphological characteristics of mollic horizons are essentially determined by their high organic matter content and strong faunal activity. Other organo-mineral surface horizons in temperate climate having diagnostic importance in WRB (umbric, melanic) are also dominated by organic matter features, but they have been far less investigated.

In contrast, the role of organic matter is insignificant in desert topsoils such as those with takyric and yermic properties. Such intervals have a distinct set of micromorphological properties that characterise the orthotypes. Their variants are related to the evolutionary sequence of takyric soils. For intervals with yermic properties, most attention has been given to layers with vesicular microstructure.

The relative scarcity of micromorphological information about organo-mineral surface horizons of desert regions is partly due to incomplete and difficult sampling of surface features for thin section preparation for undisturbed material.

The use of micromorphological data contributes to a better understanding of the origin, properties and evolution of the described surface horizons. Responses of soils to changes in climate, environment and land use may be efficiently unravelled by micromorphological studies.

# 1. Introduction

Soil crusts are classified into three morphological types. Physical soil crusts are modifications of topsoil caused by physical perturbation, such as raindrop impact or sedimentation, resulting in development of a compacted surface layer with reduced porosity; some authors prefer to use the term seal if no drying or hardening has taken place (Remley & Bradford, 1989). Biological soil crusts (BSCs) are living communities of lichens, cyanobacteria, algae or mosses growing on and near the soil surface and binding soil particles. Chemical crusts are salt crusts, which are discussed elsewhere (Mees & Tursina, 2018). These three main crust types are not mutually exclusive, as many forms of biological soil crusts will also exhibit some physical or chemical crusting (Cantón et al., 2003; Malam Issa et al., 2011; Williams et al., 2012). Although the word crust may also indicate hard layers of lateritic, calcareous and siliceous material, as well as horizons described as 'weathering crusts' by Russian authors, these terms have meanings that are different from those discussed in this chapter. Physical compaction by trampling (Rentzel et al., 2017) or tillage also forms physical soil crusts, but this is not covered here.

Micromorphological studies of vertically oriented thin sections of soil crusts, as well as SEM studies, have contributed considerably to our understanding of crusts and have enhanced field-plot to hand-lens scale observations of surface processes (see Valentin & Bresson, 1992; West et al., 1992; Bresson & Valentin, 1994; Slattery & Bryan, 1994; Pagliai & Stoops, 2010; Williams et al., 2012; Felde et al., 2014). Endpoint and sequential laboratory and field experiments combined with micromorphology have been important for understanding crust and seal formation (e.g., Southard et al., 1988; Luk et al., 1990; Poesen et al., 1990; see also Table 1), particularly the genesis and destruction of ephemeral structures (Luk et al., 1990; Mermut et al., 1995). Morphometric quantification of pore shape, size, continuity and distribution allows identification of microstructural changes associated with crust formation that correspond to changes in soil functions, which can support land management interpretations (Pagliai, 1994).

The aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of the micromorphological expressions of soil crust formation and to reconcile differences in terminology. Table 1 provides an overview of the most relevant papers dealing with the micromorphological characterisation of physical and biological crusts.

# 2. Physical Soil Crusts

Physical soil crusts form in a variety of climatic conditions but are widespread on soils of arid and semiarid regions, in both natural and cultivated systems (see also Gerasimova & Lebedeva, 2018). In temperate areas, surface crusts most commonly develop on unstable loamy soils with low organic matter content (Mücher & De Ploey, 1977), especially when cultivated (Pagliai et al., 1983a; Norton & Schroeder, 1987; Pagliai, 1987; Poesen & Nearing, 1993). In recent decades, soil degradation resulting from intensive land use has

caused physical surface crusts to develop on most soil types (Valentin & Janeau, 1989; Pagliai, 2004).

Soil seals and physical soil crusts have a strong negative influence on seedling emergence and water infiltration rates (Volk & Geyger, 1970; Sombroek, 1986; West et al., 1992; Bresson & Valentin, 1994; Pagliai, 2008). The decrease in water infiltration causes problems for irrigation, whereas increases in surface runoff lead to significant soil erosion (Moore & Singer, 1990). Several studies suggest that no-till systems (e.g., Pagliai et al., 1983a, 1989; Pagliai, 1987) and the use of soil conditioners and amendments may reduce crust formation by improving soil structure and aggregate stability, thereby increasing infiltration (Pagliai & La Marca, 1979; Pagliai et al., 1983b; Le Souder et al., 1990; Reichert & Norton, 1995). In such studies, soil micromorphology has enhanced our understanding of crust characteristics and management.

A first description and illustration of physical soil crusts in thin section, dealing with a sedimentary crust, was published by Kubiëna (1938, p. 196-197). The first broader micromorphological study of physical soil crusts was made in 1939 by Duley, which was followed only much later by other significant micromorphological studies, in the 1970s. More recently, research has expanded to include detailed conceptual models of crust development (e.g., Bresson & Valentin, 1990; Malam Issa et al., 1999; Ries & Hirt, 2008).

The three main morphological types of physical soil crusts, occurring individually or in combination, develop through both natural and anthropogenic processes. Structural crusts (Section 2.1) form through in situ modification of the soil surface by raindrop impact and by wetting and drying cycles. Vesicular surface horizons (Section 2.2) form when air is entrapped by advancing wetting fronts to form vesicular pores. Sedimentary crusts (Section 2.3) form through deposition of transported material. Although most crusts are strictly pedofeatures, some vesicular surface horizons and sedimentary crusts reach sufficient thickness to be considered soil horizons. Figure 1 illustrates the pathways that form common physical soil crust types.

Systematic descriptions of physical soil crusts are rare in the literature, and terminology varies greatly (Bresson & Valentin, 1994). The micromorphological data provided here, and outlined in Table 1, are based on the study and interpretation of published photographs and schematic drawings, with terminology drawn primarily from the reviews by West et al. (1992) and Bresson and Valentin (1994).

The morphology and characteristics of physical soil crusts vary as a function of soil and climatic conditions. Crusts commonly range from less than  $1\mathrm{mm}$  up to  $5\mathrm{cm}$  in thickness and are more compact, hard and brittle than the underlying soil and also have a different porosity, in terms of void size, number and arrangement (Valentin & Ruiz Figueroa, 1987; Bresson & Boiffin, 1990; West et al., 1992; Bresson & Valentin, 1994; Pagliai, 2008). Particle size, soil wetting, surface water flow and runoff, soil moisture, organic matter content, pore water chemistry and rainfall kinetic energy largely control the morphology, strength, structure, bulk density, infiltration rate and permeability of

physical soil crusts (Tackett & Pearson, 1965; Gupta & Larson, 1979; Valentin, 1986; Arshad & Mermut, 1988; Remley & Bradford, 1989; Greene & Ringrose-Voase, 1994).

# 2.1 Structural Crusts

Structural crusts are categorised into four types: (i) disruptional crusts, which form when aggregates are disrupted or disintegrate upon raindrop impact (Figs. 2 and 3) or when aggregates slake because of compression of entrapped air (Le Bissonnais, 1996), resulting in particle rearrangement (West et al., 1992); (ii) coalescing crusts (or agradational crusts), which develop when well-separated aggregates of moist soil material coalesce under raindrop impact, whereby the aggregates are welded to form a single apedal layer (Bresson & Boiffin, 1990; Kwaad & Mücher, 1994; Bresson & Moran, 2004); (iii) erosional crusts, which are thin layers of non-oriented fine-grained material whose formation is related to erosion (Bresson & Valentin, 1994); and (iv) sieving crusts, which are composed of a coarse-grained surface layer overlying a fine-grained layer that results from winnowing or sieving processes initiated by raindrop impact (Bresson & Valentin, 1994). The mechanisms that form structural crusts, as well as differences in morphology, are strongly tied to soil surface conditions and rainfall characteristics (Bresson & Moran, 2004), with disruptional crusts forming on dry soils in summer and coalescing crusts forming on wet soils during winter (Le Bissonnais & Bruand, 1993).

# 2.1.1 Disruptional Crusts

Disruptional crusts consist of four microlayers, which occur individually or in combination (Figs. 1 to 3): the disruptional microlayer, the skin seal, the washed-out microlayer, and the washed-in microlayer (McIntyre, 1958; Arshad & Mermut, 1988; West et al., 1992; Bresson & Valentin, 1994; Chiang et al., 1994). A model for the development of disruptional seals and crusts was initially proposed by McIntyre (1958), and the genesis and stages of formation of these crusts have been further discussed by other authors (e.g., Farres, 1978; Bresson & Boiffin, 1990; Chen et al., 1980; Tarchitzky et al., 1984; Collins et al., 1986; Luk et al., 1990; West et al., 1992; Bresson & Valentin, 1994; Chiang et al., 1994; Mermut et al., 1995; Bajracharya & Lal, 1999). In the model of McIntyre (1958), slaking drives the formation of the microlayers of disruptional crusts, which occur on bare, dry soils (Bresson & Valentin, 1994). This model of development involves (i) slaking, or disintegration of cohesive aggregates, resulting from compression of entrapped air or dispersion of clay (disruptional microlayer) (Bresson &Valentin, 1994); (ii) formation of a surface layer of coarse material with most of the fine material removed (washed-out layer); (iii) accumulation of fine material beneath that surface layer (washed-in layer), plugging available voids and hence reducing water movement; and (iv) development of a thin layer (c.  $100\mu \mathrm{m}$ ) of fine particles along the soil surface (skin seal; McIntyre, 1958), attributed to aggregate breakdown and compaction by raindrop impact (Chen et al., 1980; Tarchitzky et al., 1984) or to settling of fine particles from suspension at the end of the rainfall event (Pagliai et al., 1983b; Onofiok & Singer, 1984; Norton, 1987; Arshad & Mermut, 1988).

# 2.1.1.1 Disruptional Microlayer

The disruptional microlayer forms through slaking, due to compression of entrapped air or dispersion of clay, producing a dense layer at the soil surface. This microlayer is  $100\mu \mathrm{m}$  to  $6\mathrm{mm}$  thick (Arshad & Mermut, 1988) and shows no internal layering (Bresson & Valentin, 1994). The disruptional layer has a smaller aggregate size than the underlying soil, and it has a porosity that is 30 to  $60\%$  lower (Chiang et al., 1994).

In strongly aggregated soils, the disruptional microlayer forms slowly and is initially recognised by the presence of newly formed small aggregates that bind the original larger aggregates together. In weakly aggregated soils, detached micromass material quickly fills interpedal voids (Cousin et al., 2005). In early stages of formation, particles are oriented parallel to the surface (Luk et al., 1990). In sandy soil materials, coatings of fine particles on coarse grains are quickly removed, leaving uncoated grains (Chen et al., 1980; Tarchitzky et al., 1984). For granite-derived soils, Moss (1991a, 1991b) observed the formation of a silt layer on the soil surface, overlying a compacted layer. Other authors describe small depressions resulting from raindrop impact (e.g., Slattery & Bryan, 1994; Zhao et al., 2015), or small protrusions (Slattery & Bryan, 1992).

The c/f-related distribution pattern and the b-fabric of the disruptional microlayer depend on the soil material affected. The m1 microhorizon of Bresson and Boiffin (1990) is a discontinuous disruptional microlayer showing moderate to weak ped separation,

whereas the overlying m2 microhorizon corresponds to a more continuous, apedal microlayer, and the m3 microhorizon is a local sedimentary surface.

The susceptibility of soils to slaking and formation of the disruptional microlayer are determined by soil texture, organic matter content, mineralogical composition of the clay fraction, cation saturation, and Fe and Al hydroxide content (see Le Bissonnais, 1996; Amézketa, 1999). Medium-textured soils with  $<20\%$  clay are susceptible to slaking, and swelling clays such as smectite are more prone to crust formation than kaolinitic materials (e.g., Mermut et al., 1995). Clay dispersion is favoured by high exchangeable Na contents, whereas Fe and Al hydroxides have a stabilising effect (see Le Bissonnais, 1996).

# 2.1.1.2 Skin Seal

Skin seals, formed by raindrop-induced compaction or fine particle deposition (Chen et al., 1980; Onofiok & Singer, 1984), are very thin surface coatings composed of fine material (clay, silt, fine sand), with strial b-fabric. Skin seals vary in thickness from less than  $10\mu \mathrm{m}$  (Luk et al., 1990) or  $50~{\mu\mathrm{m}}$  (Arshad & Mermut, 1988) to  $500~{\mu\mathrm{m}}$  (Chiang et al., 1994). In studies by Pagliai et al. (1983a), the skin seal is only a few micrometres thick and can directly overlie a relatively pure silt layer. McIntyre (1958) described the skin seal as having no visible pores, but SEM analysis shows many small ( $< 5\mu \mathrm{m}$  wide) parallel planar voids (Arshad & Mermut, 1988). Seals are commonly local features, being confined to interridge depressions adjacent to microtopographic ridges. However, the extent of skin seals may increase or become more continuous as a rainfall event continues (Bresson et al., 2001).

# 2.1.1.3 Washed-Out Microlayer

The washed-out layer (Onofiok & Singer, 1984) is a thin, micromass-depleted hypo-coating along the soil surface. This layer forms only after prolonged rainfall (Luk et al., 1990). It ranges from less than 1 to  $5\mathrm{mm}$  in thickness, depending on surface topography, duration of rain impact and aggregate stability (Chiang et al., 1994), and it commonly displays a coarse monic c/f-related distribution pattern. The fine material that is removed in suspension from the washed-out layer is commonly thought to be translocated into the underlying washed-in microlayer (McIntyre, 1958; Poesen, 1981; Onofiok & Singer, 1984; Luk et al., 1990), but lateral evacuation of fine material (West et al., 1990, 1992; Radcliffe et al., 1991; Mermut et al., 1995; Clegg et al., 1999) and local surface deposition of coarse material (West et al., 1990) have also been suggested. Vertical translocation is observed when the grain size or sorting is different from that of the underlying soil. Sieving crusts (see Section 2.1.4) can be considered to be a type of washed-out layer (Bresson & Valentin, 1994).

# 2.1.1.4 Washed-In Microlayer

The washed-in microlayer lies below the washed-out layer. It is a thin layer in which fine material, in the form of particles or aggregates, has been washed in and accumulates, plugging the voids. Clay illuviation has been suggested as a mechanism for this process, but Bresson and Valentin (1994) contend that evidence for clay translocation has not been clearly demonstrated.

The morphology of the washed-in layer varies with soil texture. In sandy material, the washed-in layer starts as a discontinuous band of clay (Bielders & Baveye, 1995), which is morphologically similar to a sieving crust (see Section 2.1.4). In loess, the deposits of translocated clay have a speckled orientation pattern (Luk et al., 1990) and occur at a depth of  $1\mathrm{mm}$ . Removal of the overlying washed-out layer can transform the washed-in layer to a surface seal.

# 2.1.2 Coalescing Crusts

Coalescing crusts, also called agradational crusts, form by gradual welding of aggregates upon wetting of moist soil material (Bresson & Boiffin, 1990; Kwaad & Mücher, 1994; Clegg et al., 1999). Under moist soil conditions, little slaking occurs (Le Bissonnais et al., 1990; Kwaad & Mücher, 1994). As crust development proceeds, smaller aggregates disappear first. Eventually, packing voids are transformed to vugs, and planar voids may appear. The newly developed microstructure of the affected surface interval, with a diffuse lower boundary, is much denser than the original structure (Bresson & Boiffin, 1990). A special form of coalescing crusts, known as a 'swelling crust' (Valentin, 1991) forms because of swelling of clay. A similar process, known as slumping, occurs when overburden pressure causes structural collapse that welds soil aggregates and results in the formation of hard-setting seedbeds (Bresson & Moran, 2004).

# 2.1.3 Erosional Crusts

Erosional crusts, which occur primarily on arid rangelands, are thin fine-grained layers with poor grain orientation. These crusts form on the highest points of irregular soil surfaces and extend across lower parts (Valentin, 1986). Such crusts are thought to form by selective removal of coarse grains in conditions with strong raindrop impact (Chen et al., 1980; Valentin, 1991). They can also form by removal, through erosion, of the coarse-grained surface layer of disruptional or sieving crusts, exposing the underlying fine-grained layer (Valentin, 1986). Morphological similarities with biological soil crusts (e.g., filament knobs and filament sheets) suggest that some occurrences may be formed by biological processes (Williams et al., 2012).

# 2.1.4 Sieving Crusts

Sieving crusts, which are most commonly observed for sandy soils of arid and semiarid tropical regions, form when rainfall causes vertical sorting of soil material, resulting in the development of a succession of three layers (Valentin & Bresson, 1992): (i) an upper layer of loose coarse sand or fine gravel, (ii) a middle fine-grained layer of densely packed grains, with vesicles, and (iii) a lower layer with a high concentration of densely packed fine particles, resulting in reduced porosity (Valentin & Bresson, 1992; Nicolau et al., 1996; Puigdefabregas et al., 1999; Solé-Benet et al., 2002; Contreras et al., 2008). The depth of the fine layer seems to be controlled by mechanical energy (raindrop momentum) rather than by physicochemical properties, as no such sorting occurs when the material is protected from drop impact (Bielders & Baveye, 1995). Desert pavements,

which are common in arid regions and form in combination with vesicular horizons (Section 2.2), are considered to be a special case of sieving crust (Springer, 1958).

# 2.2 Vesicular Surface Horizons

Vesicular surface horizons are characterised by dense concentrations of vesicular pores (Figs. 4 and 5). They were first discussed by Springer (1958), who proposed the horizon symbol  $\mathrm{A_v}$ . Soils with vesicular surface horizons have also been called 'Schaumböden'

(foam soils) (Volk & Geyger, 1970). Although vesicular surface horizons are most common in arid and semiarid climates (Turk & Graham, 2011), they are also observed within humid regions, alpine areas and arctic zones (Volk & Geyger, 1970; Badorreck et al., 2013; see also Van Vliet-Lanoë & Fox, 2018). They are commonly observed in association with biological soil crusts (Williams et al., 2012), salt crusts (Mees & Singer, 2006), or in soils with furrow irrigation (Miller, 1971). Vesicular horizons may be up to several centimetres thick below desert pavements (Turk & Graham, 2011). Vesicular surface horizons are distinct from vesicular layers that display similar micromorphological characteristics but occur in deeper parts of soil profiles, as observed for paddy soils (G. Stoops, unpublished data).

The mechanisms forming vesicular surface horizons have been investigated experimentally. Evenari et al. (1974) suggest that vesicle formation is the result of expanding air trapped by surface crusts or desert pavements (reg soils). However, studies with simulated desert pavements indicate that vesicles do not form directly under rocks (Poesen et al., 1990; Dietze et al., 2012). A comprehensive experimental study by Dietze et al. (2012) identified three mechanisms that lead to increasing gas pressures within the soil matrix, resulting in vesicular pore formation: (i) downward migration of the wetting front, (ii) surface sealing by fine materials, and (iii) water pooling above the surface seal. Pore development appears to be influenced by the number of wetting cycles, as artificial vesicular crusts may be obtained after 5-10 simulated wetting and drying cycles (Figueira & Stoops, 1983; Figueira, 1984) and the general appearance of the natural vesicular surface horizon is reached after 20-30 cycles (Figueira & Stoops, 1983). These studies and others (Miller, 1971) have demonstrated that with increasing number of cycles, the number of pores decreases but vesicle size increases. Following the disturbance of vesicular surface crusts, the vesicular pore structure can be reestablished in natural soils within one year (Yonovitz & Drohan, 2009).

Vesicles are by definition the dominant void type (Figs. 4 and 5) in vesicular surface horizons. The vesicles are commonly arranged in parallel horizontal bands (Brewer, 1964). Vesicle diameters range from  $25\mu \mathrm{m}$  to  $8\mathrm{mm}$ , with predominantly small pores  $(25 - 500\mu \mathrm{m})$  in natural soils (Volk & Geyger, 1970; Escadafal & Fedoroff, 1987). Pore density ranges from 300 to 500 vesicles/  $\mathrm{cm}^2$  in vertical cross-sections, with a pore volume of up to  $40\%$  (Volk & Geyger, 1970), to more than 600 vesicles/  $\mathrm{cm}^2$  and a total pore volume of  $31\%$  (Figueira & Stoops, 1983). For vesicular horizons below desert pavements, porosities of up to  $50\%$  have been reported (Escadafal & Fedoroff, 1987).

Vesicle formation is dynamic, with vesicles being destroyed and reformed, depending on water saturation (Luk et al., 1990) and root activity (Dietze et al., 2012). Turk and Graham (2014) proposed a conceptual model of pore evolution in vesicular horizons, starting with equant vesicles, which evolve to non-equant vesicles, which in turn can merge into individual vugs or connected vugs, which will finally collapse to form planar voids. These observations are supported by other studies demonstrating that larger vesicles commonly occur in the upper  $1 - 2\mathrm{cm}$  of the surface horizon, and smaller pores occur in the lower  $3 - 5\mathrm{cm}$  (Bouza et al., 1993), where they grade to planar voids

(Anderson et al., 2002) or vugs (Volk & Geyger, 1970; Figueira, 1984; Collins et al., 1986). Similar phenomena occur within sedimentary crusts, where vesicles  $(0.2 - 3.0\mathrm{mm})$  collapse upon drying, giving rise to vugs (Kooistra & Siderius, 1986).

Vesicular surface horizons form in silt-rich material, and while clay contents can be very low, high sand contents are common (Volk & Geyger, 1970). The c/f-related distribution pattern of vesicular surface horizons is porphyric (Figueira & Stoops, 1983; Valentin & Ruiz Figueroa, 1987; Luk et al., 1990; Bouza et al., 1993). A porostriated b-fabric was described by Bouza et al. (1993). In arid soils, a calcitic crystallitic b-fabric can occur, and strong calcite impregnation may affect part of the horizon (Collins et al., 1986). A thin, dense, often laminar crust of fine material with a strial or calcitic crystallitic b-fabric commonly occurs at the surface (e.g., Anderson et al., 2002). Vesicle walls are commonly coated with parallel-oriented, speckled clay (Volk & Geyger, 1970; Figueira & Stoops, 1983; Fedoroff & Courty, 1987), which may be most apparent at the base of the vesicle (Bouza et al., 1993). Textural coatings covering the sides of vesicles and interconnecting fissures are interpreted to have formed between air bubble and void wall in wet conditions (Sullivan & Koppi, 1991). In some cases, grain size of the groundmass increases from the vesicle wall to the midpoint between neighbouring vesicles (Collins et al., 1986). In addition to clay coatings, thin calcite coatings have also been reported (Evenari et al., 1974; Collins et al., 1986).

# 2.3 Sedimentary Crusts

Sedimentary crusts (Figs. 6 to 10) form by lateral transport and subsequent deposition of fine particles along the soil surface. Sedimentary crusts have also been called

depositional crusts, but the former term will be used to avoid confusion, as suggested by Arshad and Mermut (1988) and West et al. (1992), because washed-in layers have also been termed 'depositional crusts'. Sedimentary crusts form in a variety of environments, where they can be local features (e.g., in furrows and rill channels) or widespread deposits (e.g., base of sheet erosion-affected slopes, irrigation basins) (Evans & Buol, 1968; Bishay & Stoops, 1975). In cultivated soils, sedimentary seals are very common and

may occur in microlows or overlie disruptional crusts (Panini et al., 1997) and commonly consist of small stable aggregates (Falayi & Bouma, 1975). A special type of anthropogenic sedimentary crust is formed when liquid organic manure slurry is spread on the soil surface (Svestrup et al., 1995).

Sedimentary crusts form when the fine soil particles, derived from disintegration of soil aggregates, are transported and deposited at a certain distance from the source to form a crust with a different composition and structure than the underlying soil (Chen et al., 1980) (Fig. 6). Deposition may occur on a previously formed crust, producing a layer with a different texture (Pagliai & La Marca, 1979). Salts can play an important role in depositional crust formation in clayey soils, as clays may be dispersed in moderately saline conditions, followed by deposition upon drying (Labib et al., 1975; Tayel et al., 1975). The thickness of these sedimentary crusts generally ranges from a few millimetres to a few centimetres, with the thickest crusts being composed of several layers (e.g., Kooistra & Siderius, 1986; Boiffin & Bresson, 1987). These layers can be sorted or laminar (Bresson & Valentin, 1994) (Figs. 7 and 8). Drain fillings often have the same micromorphological characteristics as sedimentary seals (Hall, 1987), including a banded distribution of the groundmass (Herrero Isern et al., 1989).

Sedimentary crusts on sandy soils consist of finer-grained layers (silt or clay) that include few pores that are larger than a few micrometres, alternating with coarse-grained layers with greater total porosity. Isolated larger voids may occur randomly within the fine-grained layers. With the exception of packing voids and surface-parallel planar voids, few voids occur within the coarse-textured layers, but vesicles can be present in association with surface crusting (Pagliai et al., 1989) or concentrate below clay seals (Courty, 1986).

Sedimentary crusts are characterised by a clear banded distribution parallel to the surface, with alternating clayey and more coarse-grained layers. In many crusts, with variable textures, some layers show a clear fining-upward textural gradient (Southard et al., 1988) (Fig. 9). The thickness of individual laminae ranges from 3 to  $9\mathrm{mm}$  (Valentin & Ruiz Figueroa, 1987), and layers may be irregular because of small-scale erosion (Fig. 10). Clay particles and coarser plate-shaped grains are commonly oriented parallel to the surface (Evans & Buol, 1968). Parallel orientation of fine platy particles, with negligible porosity, is also observed in SEM studies (Arshad & Mermut, 1988). Laboratory experiments (Southard et al., 1988) indicate that the strongest parallel orientation occurs during sedimentation in distilled water, whereas phosphogypsum addition provokes clay flocculation, resulting in a more random orientation and a speckled b-fabric. Material suspended in pure water can penetrate up to  $5\mathrm{mm}$  in the underlying layer, where it forms deposits with strong parallel orientation (Southard et al., 1988). In the same study, material suspended in water with a high electrolyte content penetrates to less than  $0.5\mathrm{mm}$ . Below sedimentary crusts on sandy materials, textural coatings may form in horizontal planar voids (Fedoroff & Courty, 1987).

Poorly sorted laminae form by rainsplash and overland flow (Clegg et al., 1999), whereas well-sorted laminae result from afterflow (Mücher & De Ploey, 1977; Mücher

et al., 1981). Sedimentary deposits in microlows clearly show wedging of the composing layers along the walls of the depression (Kooistra & Siderius, 1986). Multiple layers of foreset laminae of coarse silt to fine sand are thought to be overwash deposits (Kooistra & Siderius, 1986), which display an angle of 60 to 70 degrees and may be several centimetres thick.

The c/f-related distribution pattern of sedimentary crusts ranges from fine monic in the clayey parts, over porphyric to coarse monic in sandy parts, where it can also locally be enaulic or gefuric (Hall, 1987). In cultivated soils, tissue residues and charcoal fragments are common. In the fine-grained upper part of each layer, the commonly observed strial b-fabric (e.g., Southard et al., 1988) may be masked by a calcitic crystallitic b-fabric (Bishay & Stoops, 1975).

# 3. Biological Soil Crusts

BSCs are complexes of lichens, cyanobacteria, algae or mosses that bind and enmesh soil grains. BSCs are commonly observed in arid and semiarid regions, from hot subequatorial zones to the cold deserts of polar zones (Belnap et al., 2001a). They occur where soils are exposed or unvegetated and relatively stable and undisturbed. BSCs are thought to have a net positive impact on surface soils, by acting as a surface membrane that regulates the flow of water, gases and solutes across soils (Belnap et al., 2003), reducing erosion (McKenna Neuman et al., 1996; Miralles-Mellado et al., 2011; Rodríguez-Caballero et al., 2014), modifying water and energy balances (Belnap, 2006; Thomas et al., 2011; Rodríguez-Caballero et al., 2012; Couradeau et al., 2016), improving soil fertility (Kleiner & Harper, 1977; Evans & Belnap, 1999; Delgado-Baquerizo et al., 2016) and influencing plant community establishment (Li et al., 2005; Escudero et al., 2007; Hernandez & Sandquist, 2011; Lan et al., 2013). BSCs are extremely fragile and sensitive to disturbances such as off-road vehicles, hiking and grazing (Belnap, 1998) and are estimated to take decades to thousands of years to recover from disruption (Belnap & Warren, 2002; Williams et al., 2012).

Some of the earliest descriptions of BSCs were published in the 1960s and 1970s (e.g., Cameron & Blank, 1966; Friedmann & Galun, 1974). The primary focus of most early BSC studies was the biological taxonomy of component organisms and their ecological roles. Only recently have their biosedimentary structures been subject to micromorphological analysis (e.g., Campbell, 1979; Greene et al., 1990; Danin & Ganor, 1991; Belnap, 2001; Malam Issa et al., 2001; Hoppert et al., 2004; Miralles-Mellado et al., 2011; Lan et al., 2012; Williams et al., 2012; Felde et al., 2014).

Several soil crust classification systems have been proposed for BSCs, either characterising the morphology of the component organisms (e.g., Eldridge & Greene, 1994) and/or emphasising changes in soil morphological features during crust development. Belnap et al. (2001a, 2001b) developed a classification system based on climate-driven differences in crust surface microtopography, including flat and rugose crusts of hot deserts and rolling and pinnacled crusts of cool deserts. Other authors have

proposed successional models that characterise changes in crust morphology and microtopography with time (e.g., Danin et al., 1998; Thomas & Dougill, 2007; Lan et al., 2012) or level of development (Belnap et al., 2008). The following discussion is based on the work of Williams et al. (2012), which integrates conclusions from these previous morphological studies, extended based on new observations.

# 3.1 Macromorphological Features

Several studies have identified two dominant zones within most BSC types, which are visible to the naked eye (Malam Issa et al., 2009; Miralles-Mellado et al., 2011; Fischer et al., 2012; Williams et al., 2012; Felde et al., 2014): (i) a highly cohesive surface layer (0.5 to  $20\mathrm{mm}$  thick) with great abundance of biological components, capped by biological structures ('bio-rich zone'; Williams et al., 2012), and (ii) a lower non-cohesive layer composed of poorly consolidated and pedologically unstructured grains, with lower abundance of organic material ('bio-poor zone'; Williams et al., 2012). A planar void that is visible with a hand lens commonly separates both zones (Williams et al., 2012; Felde et al., 2014) (Fig. 11).

In most BSC successional models, crust formation commences as a layer dominated by cyanobacteria. If conditions are favourable, these develop into crusts composed of lichens and short mosses (short-moss-lichen crusts), eventually succeeded by pinnaced crusts consisting of lichens and tall mosses (tall-moss-lichen crusts). The latter may include vesicular pores (within the pinnacles) and vesicular horizons (beneath the pinnacles) (e.g., Williams et al., 2012). In the field, cyanobacteria-dominated crusts are characterised by a relatively smooth surface, pale colour, recognisable filamentous cyanobacteria. Short-moss-lichen crusts are recognisably dominated by lichens and mosses, with  $\leq 2$  cm of vertical relief and a rolling surface morphology. Tall-moss-lichen pinnaced crusts form small mounds (up to  $5\mathrm{cm}$  high), which are commonly separated by polygonal surface cracks. The upper interval with high concentration of biological

Processes (dark blue) proceed through time concurrent with changes in crust species composition and morphological features, including evolution of surface layer with great abundance of biological components (brown) and lower layer with lower abundance of organic material (yellow).

components is up to  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  thick in cyanobacteria-dominated crusts,  $10\mathrm{mm}$  thick in short-moss-lichen crusts, and  $20\mathrm{mm}$  thick in tall-moss-lichen crusts.

# 3.2 Micromorphological Features

Figure 11 illustrates the genetic processes that drive the formation of the three BSC types (Williams et al., 2012). In thin section, BSC components are mineral grains (predominantly clay to medium sand), biotic structures (filaments, lichens, plant roots and mosses) and intricate voids. As the component organisms change and formative processes become more complex, organic and mineral material accumulates, microtopographic relief is enhanced, and increasingly intricate biosedimentary structures are formed (Williams et al., 2012). Precipitation and stabilisation of authigenic minerals dominate at the stage of cyanobacteria-dominated crust formation and continue throughout the succession. Expansion-contraction (caused by wetting-drying) and dust capture processes become more pronounced through the formation of short-moss-lichen crusts. The mentioned processes become more intense during formation of the tall-moss-lichen crusts, during which mass-wasting and vesicular pore development also take place.

# 3.2.1 Stabilisation and Authigenic Mineral Precipitation Features

Filamentous cyanobacteria, such as Microcoleus, play a primary role in stabilisation by weaving around fine sands and by trapping clay, silt and very fine sand grains that stick to their mucilaginous sheaths (Campbell, 1979; Belnap & Gardner, 1993; Zhang et al., 2006; Thomas & Dougill, 2007).Authigenic minerals (primarily carbonates) are precipitated as the sheath material of the cyanobacteria is mineralised (Campbell, 1979; Braissant et al., 2003; Souza-Egipsy et al., 2004), which results in cementation of the crust and further stabilises the soil surface (Williams et al., 2012).

Stabilisation processes and authigenic mineral precipitation occur in all crust types and form two main types of features. One type is filament sheets (up to  $300\mu \mathrm{m}$  thick), which are horizontal surface structures consisting of compacted clays to very fine sands, enmeshed in likely cyanobacterial filaments, with variations in grain size between successive layers (Thomas & Dougill, 2007; Williams et al., 2012; Felde et al., 2014). Another type is filament knobs, which are surface protrusions with convex summits, consisting of clay to sand, and up to  $2\mathrm{mm}$  wide and  $4\mathrm{mm}$  tall, which form when the distribution of cyanobacteria is not uniform (Williams et al., 2012). The tallest knobs contain poorly developed to well-developed vesicular pores. The shortest knobs contain planar voids, aligned parallel to the knob summits. These voids are  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  wide and  $0.25\mathrm{mm}$  thick and occur approximately  $1\mathrm{mm}$  below the surface. Sharp protrusions formed by silt- and clay-coated filaments are commonly observed along the top of the knobs.

# 3.2.2 Dust Capture and Shrink-Swell Features

Dust capture potential and heaving processes increase throughout the BSC succession, as component organisms change and surface roughness increases. Cyanobacteria-dominated crusts, with smooth surfaces, capture only relatively small amounts of dust, by trapping particles on mucilaginous filament sheaths (Campbell, 1979; Belnap & Gardner, 1993; Chen et al., 2009; Lan et al., 2012), whereas establishment of mosses (Fig. 12) and lichens increases dust capture potential by forming short-moss-lichen crusts with rolling surface topography and eventually tall-moss-lichen crusts with a more irregular surfaces and greater microtopographic relief (Williams et al., 2012) (Fig. 13).

Wetting-drying cycles cause dust capture to fluctuate through time and, in combination with shrinking-swelling of organic tissues, result in differential heaving that causes development of surface irregularities. Cracks become filled with dust during dry stages and close again by groundmass expansion during wet stages (Williams, 2011), eventually forming expansion-contraction features similar to those of Vertisols (Williams et al., 2012). Various unique biosedimentary features can also develop, including organic sheets that become partially or completely detached from the soil surface by curling upwards ('upturned features', 'rafts'; Williams et al., 2012), commonly with some attached mineral grains (Wynn-Williams, 1990; Williams et al., 2012). Other features are protrusions composed mainly of clay and silt that developed within or beneath lichen rhizine structures ('pedestals', 'towers'; Williams et al., 2012) (Fig. 14). In cool

environments, considerable surface roughness may also develop when hoof prints are made by large mammals (Csotonyi & Addicott, 2004) or when the soil is affected by frost heave (Belnap, 2001; Marsh et al., 2006).

# 3.2.3 Destabilization and Mass-Wasting Features

Although several features of developing tall-moss-lichen crusts increase their stability and reduce erosion, sustained buildup leads to microscale instability and mass-wasting (Williams et al., 2012). Processes include toppling, collapse, creep, sloughing, differential

erosion and dissolution of authigenic minerals. The resulting features include narrow columnar protrusions, overhanging curved extensions of surface-parallel layers and bridge-like structures extending along the top of large voids ('hoodoos', 'curved features', 'biosediment bridges'; Williams et al., 2012).

# 3.2.4 Voids

BSC formation leads to the development of a variety of void morphologies, including irregular planar voids (up to  $5\mathrm{mm}$  wide), large vugs (to 24 by  $36\mathrm{mm}$ ) that can be partly lined by compacted clays to very fine sands containing organic remains and horizontal to vertical planar voids (0.5 to  $1\mathrm{mm}$  wide) that are parallel to biotic structures (Williams et al., 2012).

Vesicles  $(0.1 - 0.8\mathrm{mm})$  develop when a combination of organic matter accumulation, physical crusting and authigenic mineral precipitation seals the surface of the crust, favouring entrapment of air by the wetting front to form vesicles (Williams et al., 2012). A variety of studies have reported vesicles in association with BSCs (e.g., Danin et al., 1998; Marsh et al., 2006; Miralles-Mellado et al., 2011; Felde et al., 2014).

# 3.3 Implications of Biological Soil Crusts for Moisture Conditions

Micromorphology has been used to study the impact of BSC properties on soil moisture behaviour because the surface and internal structure of crusts control infiltration and runoff (Miralles-Mellado et al., 2011; Felde et al., 2014). The complex biotic structures and intricate void systems, with the greatest complexity being observed for tall-moss-lichen crusts, influence infiltration rates as well as moisture retention (Williams et al., 2012).

Other studies applied experimental micromorphological approaches to explore water infiltration properties of BSCs. Miralles-Mellado et al. (2011) combined infiltration measurements and micromorphological analyses to demonstrate that physical soil crusts and incipient BSCs had the fewest pores and lowest meso-macroporosity and that these crusts also had the lowest infiltration coefficients and greatest erosion potential. BSCs with lichens and cyanobacteria displayed the greatest meso- to macroporosity, but infiltration rates remained low for these crusts because they are partially detached from the underlying soil. In another study, Felde et al. (2014) used micromorphological observations, as well as mercury intrusion porosimetry and X-ray computed tomography, to demonstrate that porosity and pore size increase from cyanobacterial to lichen and short-moss crusts and that pore morphology changed from tortuous to straight, facilitating gas and solute transport. In early-stage cyanobacteria crusts, infiltration rates are also limited by pore systems composed of vesicles and other discontinuous voids, which do not conduct water as readily as interconnected pore systems (Felde et al., 2014).

# 4. Conclusions

This literature review has revealed some inconsistency in terminology and opportunities for continued research on formation of soil crusts. Historically, multiple terms have been

used to describe the same common features of physical soil crusts, and competing theories have been proposed for their formation. Consistency and consensus within the scientific community would facilitate discussions of crust development. Micromorphological research of biological soil crusts having been comparatively limited, inconsistency in terminology has been less of an issue.

Because land management interpretations depend on an understanding of how crusts form and evolve, development of clear conceptual models for both physical and biological crusts would benefit scientists and policy-makers in the future. In interpreting the results of micromorphological studies, it is important to separate results obtained for natural and experimental crusts so that researchers can revise existing models more decisively. The usefulness of micromorphological studies would also be enhanced by more systematic quantification of features and functions, allowing greater applicability in land management and in ecological impact assessments.

# 1. Introduction

Frost activity is present in many regions of the world, from high latitudes to tropical arid zones, where it may penetrate the soil to a depth of  $5 - 15\mathrm{cm}$  in winter. It is common in active to subactive Cryosols (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015) from both high altitudes and high latitudes. However, frost-induced microfabrics are not specific of present-day cold environments. Features formed during the extension of the cold domain in the Quaternary are preserved in warmer soil climates as, for instance, in the C1 to E horizons of loess soils from the temperate zone. Specific horizons such as some periglacial fragipans (Soil Survey Staff, 2014) or foliated lodgement tills of formerly glaciated regions (subglacial permafrost) are related to the specific thermal regime of permafrost and frost diagenesis of sediments (Van Vliet-Lanoë & Langohr, 1981).

The effects of frost on soil have been widely described since the first observations of Kokkonen (1927), Taber (1929), Beskow (1935), Sharp (1942), McMillan and Mitchell (1953), FitzPatrick (1956) and Frese and Czeratzki (1957). These authors showed that ice segregation is an important pedogenetic agent, influencing soils by its action on structure development, consolidation, deformation and particle translocation. Frost features are related to the segregation of ice in the soil, usually in the form of lenses, and to the heaving and associated strains resulting from both freezing and thawing.

Frost is a temperature-driven desiccation which can open shrinking fissures in the still unfrozen substratum (Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1985). As the ground freezes, the segregation of ice develops by migration of pore solution to the freezing front. In soil, frost dynamics are controlled by the local drainage conditions and the grain-size distribution (Kaplar, 1974), which specifically affects the ability of the soil to retain capillary and adsorbed water. The latter is mainly related to the content in colloidal organic matter and clay. An average pore diameter of  $50~\mu \mathrm{m}$  for intergranular porosity, is usually the most favourable for ice nucleation (Shumskii, 1964; Kaplar, 1974) explaining its common development in silty and loamy to sandy loam soils. The greater and steadier the water supply, the greater the amount of ice segregated. Soils with these textures at the capillary fringe of the water table or in moisture retention conditions close to field capacity have thus optimal conditions for ice lens development (Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1988a). A large capability to develop ice lenses, also called frost susceptibility, may lead to frost heave of the soil. In spring, the inversion of the thermal gradient, with the temperature of the frozen soil lower than that of the air, promotes the infiltration of melting water in the still frozen substratum. This can result in supplementary heave and stress in the soil (Parmuzina, 1978; Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1985) just before thaw settlement or thaw consolidation, i.e., volume loss by ice melt. Other associated processes are the development of desiccation crack networks and the lateral sliding of soil aggregates along melting ice lenses. Fragmentation of mineral grains is induced by physical weathering related to frost dehydration, hydraulic pressure development and ice crystallisation (McDowall, 1960), in association with chemical weathering and soil faunal activity. On the other hand, the translocation of particles during spring melt or the precipitation of gel-like clays or organic matter can influence or create frost-susceptibility gradients. As fissures left by ice lenses drastically reduce the shearing resistance of the thawed soil (Coutard et al., 1988), deformations can occur simultaneously with differential heave and solifluction on slopes.

Pioneering work on the micromorphology of (sub)Arctic and Antarctic Cryosols, where frost action is an active process, was undertaken by Kubiëna (1953, 1970, 1971) in the Antarctic and Arctic, FitzPatrick (1956) in Svalbard, Dumanski and St. Arnaud (1966) on the boreal soils of Canada and Morozova (1965) in central Yakoutia. They were followed by Parfenova and Yarilova (1967), Benedict (1969), Fedorova and Yarilova (1972), Bunting and Fedoroff (1974), Brewer and Pawluk (1975), Pawluk and Brewer (1975), Fox and Protz (1981), Mermut and St. Arnaud (1981), Tursina (1985) and Van Vliet-Lanoë (1988b). Other studies were performed on mountain soils of Europe (Ontañon, 1978, Harris & Ellis, 1980; Harris, 1987, 1990; Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1987a; Harris & Cook, 1988). More recent

publications report research on soils of the Antarctic (Schaefer et al., 2008, Villagran et al., 2013) and Siberia (Kovda & Lebedeva, 2013; Bronnikova et al., 2014). The study of soil thin sections has also often been used to provide information on the classification of these soils (e.g., Tursina, 1994; Tarnocai & Bockheim, 2011). Micromorphological analysis is usually performed on unfrozen material from field samples collected in summer, but some attempts have been made to study the micromorphological characteristics of still frozen soils, in natural or in experimental conditions (Dumanski, 1964; Pissart, 1970; Van Vliet-Lanoë et al., 1984; Coutard & Mücher, 1985; Coutard et al., 1988; Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1988a; Van Vliet-Lanoë & Dupas, 1991; Gubin & Gulyaeva, 1997; White & Fox, 1997; Szymański et al., 2015).

Micromorphological studies of fossil Cryosols are much more common, especially of those on loess from the Russian Plain (Morozova, 1965; Mücher & Morozova, 1983; Tursina, 1985; Gubin, 1994), from Europe (Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1976, 1988b; Miedema, 1987; Cremaschi & Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1990; Huijzer, 1993; Mestdagh, 2005) and from North America (Mermut et al., 1983; Tarnocai & Valentine, 1989; Todisco & Bhiry, 2008). Micromorphological evidence of past frost activity has been also obtained from other materials such as tills and slope deposits (FitzPatrick, 1956, 1976; Romans et al., 1966, 1980; Menzies & Maltman, 1992) and in caves (Pissart et al., 1988, Cremaschi & Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1990; Laafar et al., 1995).

A few important papers (Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1976, 1985; Mücher & Morozova, 1983; Harris, 1985; Van Vliet-Lanoë et al., 2004) review the use of soil micromorphology for the study of the effects of frost on specific soils and sediments. In the present review, the micromorphological features resulting from the effects of freezing and thawing processes on soils, in both present-day and past environments, are summarised and systematically discussed.

# 2. Microstructure

The sine qua non for ice segregation is the availability of water. Ice segregation and related microstructures can therefore not develop in very cold but dry regions of the globe (Campbell & Claridge, 1987). Most microstructures discussed further are indicative of ice segregation process in permafrost and non-permafrost cold areas as well as in subtropical arid soils. They reflect frost activity at various depths, in different materials or in specific drainage conditions. They may represent very short to very long periods, at the scale of days to millions of years. They are generally well preserved when they were formed at very low temperatures because of intense compaction and ultradesiccation (Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1985). Transitions between the different microstructures described can be observed in a soil, and the same soil may show more than one microstructure type.

# 2.1 Platy, Angular Blocky and Lenticular Microstructure

Evidence of freezing in soils is given by the characteristic lenticular and platy microstructures parallel to the surface, but it may also appear as short prismatic to blocky

micro- to mesostructures. They vary with depth usually from lenticular close to the soil surface (macroscopically foliated) to platy or angular blocky in deeper horizons, depending on the grain-size distribution and the initial consolidation status of the sediment (Tsytovich, 1975; FitzPatrick, 1976). Lenticular and platy microstructures may also be vertical, when they develop in association with ice wedge formation and thermal cracking (Mol et al., 1993). The thickness of the peds ranges from  $<200\mu \mathrm{m}$  to  $2\mathrm{cm}$ , according to the rate of frost penetration, which is controlled by the thermal gradient at the soil surface and the water supply at the freezing front. The voids that delimit the peds are similar to planar voids resulting from desiccation but have smooth and unaccommodating walls (Fig. 1A and B). If the development of ice lenses is limited, these pores may be confused with desiccation features. Other pores such as wide star-shaped vugs are often observed associated with angular blocky microstructures (Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1976) (Fig. 1C and D). Also vertical planar voids can be observed, which correspond to vertical ice blades formed in conditions of rapid freezing (Pissart, 1969). Large pores  $(0.5 - 5\mathrm{mm})$  often develop at the base of large rock fragments, mineral grains or compact aggregates (Fig. 2). This type of pore is probably related to locally increased retraction and accentuated suction, due to the high thermal conductivity of the fragment or aggregate, which results in a greater water supply for ice lens formation at the base of the coarse grains. The fact that a coarse grain creates a hydraulic barrier enhances this process (Van Vliet-Lanoë & Dupas, 1991).

McMillan and Mitchel (1953), Dumanski (1964) and Dumanski and St. Arnaud (1966), who provided some of the first micromorphological descriptions of frost-affected soils, referred to the platy and lenticular microstructures with uniformly distributed fine and coarse material as 'isoband fabric'. This fabric often occurs in frost-affected soils with silty textures or in deep horizons as a result of frost desiccation retraction (Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1985) (Fig. 1A and B).

As a consequence of the gradual decrease in thermal deficit with depth (Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1976, 1985), the size of the aggregates formed by ice lensing usually increases progressively with depth (Shumskii, 1964) in seasonally frozen soils, both macroscopically and at microscopic level. However, in permafrost soils, an abrupt change in aggregate size from coarse to fine occurs in the lower part of the active layer, at the contact with the permafrost table (Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1985). After the melting of ice or thaw consolidation, the interpedal fissures can still be open, leading to platy or foliated macroscopic soil structures. This has a direct impact on the hydraulic conductivity and further translocation of particles and also favours the lateral movement of soil water.

Frost-generated aggregates have various shapes depending on the pattern of ice accumulation in the soil (e.g., Shumskii, 1964). Ice lenses usually form if freezing is progressive and the sediments are moist but not saturated. The resulting peds are lenticular and have a tile-like arrangement in silt-rich homogenous materials (Fig. 1A), and they are curved upward in a clay-rich substratum susceptible to stronger retraction at desiccation (Fig. 1B). Rapid cooling in saturated clays or silty clays (e.g., marine or lacustrine sediments, fresh colluvium) causes rapid shrinking (Van Vliet-Lanoë et al.,

in some fragipan horizons. Vertical ice blades may invade the non-frozen part of the sediment as in colluvial or tidal deposits (Fig. 3).

In stratified sediments, discontinuities affect the shape and size of the aggregates. If stratification is oblique to the frost penetration front, the sedimentary layers are obliquely cut by ice lenses. Obliquely oriented rock fragments in sediments, related to initial fluvial or slope deposition or soil stretching, and the disruption of thinly laminated sediments can enhance the development of frost-induced microstructures (Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1985).

During thaw consolidation, regular settling of the aggregates is observed when the ice content is moderate (Fig. 4A). When ice is abundant, like near the permafrost table, random lateral displacements of the peds (Fig. 4B) or oriented lateral displacement

(Fig. 4C) on slopes, can occur because of sliding along the top of melting ice lenses that promote reduced shearing resistance.

When repetitive freeze-thaw cycles affect a soil, the lenticular or platy microstructure is affected by internal microerosion, particle translocation and some plastic deformation. Fine particles can accumulate as cappings at the upper face of the platy or lenticular aggregates, giving rise to the so-called banded fabrics (Figs. 5 and 6), already mentioned in early descriptions of active boreal soils and slope deposits (e.g., Dumanski, 1964; Romans et al., 1966; Fedorova & Yarilova, 1972; FitzPatrick, 1976). While cappings are formed, sorting and accumulation of coarse grains may occur in situ, together with vertical jacking of grains and an inverted grading of grain sizes (Fig. 5) (Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1976). The size of the mineral grains determines whether they are propelled or not on the thin water film persisting at the front of growing ice crystals. Fine particles migrate ahead of the growing ice lens, whereas coarse grains are rapidly incorporated in the ice lens.

The larger the specific surface of the grain and the thicker the water film, the longer the migration of the grains in front of the growing ice crystal will be (Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1982), resulting in vertical grading. Vertical translocation of fine particles during thaw periods further enhances the sorting of particles (Corte, 1966; Rowell & Dillon, 1972; Fox & Protz, 1981; Frenot et al., 1995). Along slopes, this sorting process is less prominent because of shearing or rotational movements (Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1982). Accumulation of sorted grains between the peds is also rather limited in materials rich in components with swell-shrink behaviour (e.g., smectite, organic matter). Accumulation of clean coarse grains has been experimentally obtained after 5-10 freezing cycles, and distinct capping along the upper face of the platy aggregate after 18-25 cycles (Coutard & Mücher, 1985), 30 cycles (Dumanski, 1964) and 100 cycles (Pawluk, 1988).

Dumanski and St. Arnaud (1966) defined three types of banded fabrics on the basis of the thickness of the 'bands' of fine material and the shape of the aggregates, which would reflect different degrees of soil development. Stoops (2003) refers to these banded fabrics as an example of complex pedofeatures related to lenticular or platy microstructures in which most peds have cappings of silt or coarse clay and are separated by more or less graded layers of clean coarse grains. The leached coarse grains correspond to the 'whitish powdering' of Russian authors (e.g., Morozova, 1965) or to 'podzol flour' (e.g., Dumanski & St. Arnaud, 1966). In present-day surface soils of Western and Eastern Europe, they are sporadically observed and often confused with a chemical or hydromorphic degradation (e.g., Hardy et al., 1999).

In active cold environments, several frost cycles may occur each year, accelerating the process. Abundance of snowmelt water and low clay content can favour the expression of frost/thaw effects at depth. A distinctive layer on the cap or coating is often produced by each freeze-thaw cycle. In climatic zones with only one effective cycle of frost each year, one can use the development and thickness of the cappings to establish a relative chronology and to determine the rate of capping formation in a specific context, such as after an abrupt change of drainage conditions (Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1985).

The presence of platy/lenticular microstructures and/or banded fabrics with a different regular spacing in a same thin section (Fig. 7A) indicates that several generations of repetitive ice lensing occurred as a consequence of burial and/or erosion of the soil profile or a change in environmental conditions and pedogenesis (Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1976; Mestdagh, 2005). Micromorphological features indicating clay translocation or other pedogenetic processes may separate the two generations of cryogenic fabrics (Fig. 7B).

Freeze-thaw banded fabrics may be a transient feature in the history of the soil and may be further disturbed by permafrost, frost creep or mud flow, or be included in larger capped platy aggregates by burial and change in the freeze-thaw regime. Soils rich in swelling clays and organic colloids are highly susceptible to frost, but the cryogenic microstructures are poorly preserved after thaw because of rehydration swelling (Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1985).

# 2.2 Granular Microstructure

Granular microstructure (Fig. 1E and F) is very common in frost-affected soils with a very fine silt to clayey texture and/or rich in amorphous colloids (e.g., Crampton, 1977). It usually occurs in the upper part of the soil (Fig. 1E), which is most susceptible to multidirectional frost and frequent freeze-thaw cycles. At the macroscopic level this corresponds to so-called frost mulching (e.g., Svestrup et al., 2005). The size of granular peds ranges from 1 to  $8\mathrm{mm}$ . These aggregates were originally small angular blocky and became more and more rounded with age because of the cumulative effect of repeated frost-induced plastic deformations. Granular peds can also form through disruption of preexisting clay coatings or infillings produced by melt water infiltration (Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1988a). In this case, they are not microstructure elements and should be described as fragmented or deformed pedofeatures (Stoops, 2003).

Individual granules sometimes show stress features along the sides (Fig. 9B), often only visible in XPL and thus corresponding to poro- or granostriated b-fabrics (see Section 3.1). These features are formed by alignment of clay particles at the surface of the aggregates under the pressure exerted by the growth of ice crystals. Their presence seems to increase structure stability (Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1976; Smith et al., 1991). Ultradesiccation and colloid flocculation have a similar effect and make the granular units resistant to deformation by cryoturbation, mass wasting and collapse on thawing (Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1988a; Fox, 1994; Ostroumov, 1998, 2004). Other features associated with granular aggregates, such as cappings of fine material on granules (Figs. 9B and 15B) and occurrences of interpedal coarse grains around weakly developed granules, have been often documented in patterned grounds. These distinctive soil fabrics have been called 'ovoid' when the granules have associated stress features along the sides (poro- or granostriated b-fabric) or when the peds are covered by a capping (Morozova, 1965;

Bunting & Fedoroff, 1974; Pawluk, 1988; Kovda & Lebedeva, 2013). Fabrics have been described in terms of 'orbiculic' textures (Fox & Protz, 1981) and 'microcircles' (Konishchev et al., 1973; Konishchev & Rogov, 1977) when coarse particle segregation has occurred between the peds, producing a two-dimensional pattern composed of rough circular bands of silt grains around granular units of more fine-grained material (Fig. 9C). Microcircles or orbiculic features seem to be often associated with very old, cryoturbated and often thixotrophic permafrost soils, subject to extremely frequent freeze-thaw cycles.

Rotation of soil aggregates and consequent formation of downturned cappings along the surface (Fig. 12C) is sometimes observed. It probably results from differential frost heave within a horizon at the microtopographical scale or from lateral displacement of the aggregates by solifluction on a slope (e.g., Aurousseau, 1976; Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1976, 1982; Harris & Ellis, 1980). Rotation events can be separated by periods of stability and non-frost pedogenesis, generating complex coatings on the grains or aggregates, often observed in downslope positions (Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1988a; Smith et al., 1991). This can produce a 'conglomeric fabric', which refers to a compound pattern consisting of

heterometric granular aggregates, mineral grains and organic compounds (e.g., plant fragments, amorphous gels), enclosed by dense fine mineral material (e.g., Fox & Protz, 1981; Fox, 1983) (Figs. 9B and 15B). This fabric usually records a change in cryogenic dynamics, related to burial by colluvial or eolian sedimentation or to cryoturbation (differential frost heave).

A granular microstructure can be transitory, whereby granular aggregates are later included in larger capped platy aggregates, by burial or by changes in the freeze-thaw regime. Granular aggregates are often found in contemporary soils affected by past permafrost. Their persistence with time attests for their increased resistance. In Cryosols and palaeosols, distinct granular aggregates often occur within the active layer, at sites with patterned ground features such as sorted circles and hummocks in the field. At greater depths, they are often found at the interface between two materials with different frost susceptibilities (Fig. 16B). They also form at depth in highly mobile solifluction lobes, in the case of temporary oversaturation in melt water (Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1976, 1982, 1995; Fox & Protz, 1981; Fox, 1983; Smith et al., 1991; Van Vliet-Lanoë et al., 2004).

Cryogenic granular peds may resemble aggregates reworked by rill wash in cold conditions, for example, accumulating at the foot slope of a fault, but they are clearly formed in the soil without any external input of material. Also, a cryogenic granular microstructure may sometimes be confused with granular or crumb microstructures produced by biological activity (Van Vliet-Lanoë et al., 1984) or salt mulching (Shein et al., 2013).

# 2.3 Microstructure Stability

Platy aggregates created solely by frost desiccation and without any compaction are often very unstable on moistening during thaw periods. This is usually the case in the A horizon and at levels near the permafrost table, where the propagation of frost is fast. In contrast, platy aggregates formed at depth by slow ice lensing under natural conditions are usually extremely firm and resistant, despite not being cemented with amorphous or other materials. This is related to ultradesiccation, causing vapour diffusion from the adsorbed water film at the surface of mineral grains and allowing the growth of ice lenses at very low temperature. The mechanical action of the enlarging ice lenses may lead to frost heave of freshly frozen material and to the development of platy aggregates. At very low temperatures (below  $-10^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ), ice lens growth and ultradesiccation by frost contribute to compaction of these aggregates and the consequent increase in aggregate stability (e.g., Van Vliet-Lanoë et al., 1984; Dagesse, 2013).

In surface horizons rich in clay, irregular ice lensing induces fragmentation of the soil aggregates, known by farmers as frost mulching. Because soil particles and fine aggregates are detached, the susceptibility of the soil surface to splash erosion and to deflation increases. At depth, the stability of the aggregates created by frost increases when thawing is slow, the coldest winter temperatures are low and the concentration of

organic or mineral colloids is high. These conditions can lead to the development of overconsolidated horizons (Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1988a, 1998).

Vesicles are commonly observed in frost-affected soils. Some authors (Van Vliet-Lanoë et al., 1984; Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1985, 1988a) attributed them to the expulsion of the air that was present between the ice crystals and inside peds in the frozen soil and that became trapped when the microstructure collapsed on sudden moistening during thawing. Other authors (FitzPatrick, 1956; Bunting, 1977; Harris & Ellis, 1980; Harris, 1983) explained vesicles as the result of air expelled from soil water during freezing. Vesicles are usually perfectly round in silt-rich or silt-and-sand-rich materials (Fig. 8A), but in clayey or organic soils they are often mammillated (Fig. 8B). Vesicles often occur in the upper  $5\mathrm{cm}$  of the soil but may also occur along cracks or at depth when the presence of abundant rock fragments affects the thermal conductivity of the soil resulting in a relatively fast thawing.

The partial or total collapse of the microstructure of the soil surface under high precipitation and recurrent frost action enhances particle translocation processes. A direct consequence is the development at depth of B horizons with accumulations of fine material (FitzPatrick, 1956, 1976, 1993; Romans & Robertson, 1975; Forman & Miller, 1984; Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1985; Locke, 1986), which lead to differences in frost susceptibility within the profile. Differential frost susceptibility, due to variations in the clay and silt content, also exists between upslope and the downslope soils (Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1987b, 1995). The pedofeatures associated with these processes are further discussed in Section 4.

Needle ice formation, in combination with subsequent summer rainfall, also promotes the collapse of the microstructure by separating the peds and releasing particles. A splash crust (Fig. 8B) may form on the soil surface, and in deeper horizons layered or cross-layered infillings of silt and coarse clay can develop (see Section 4; Fig. 13B). One can confuse these structural splash crusts with the structure collapse occurring by liquefaction at the surface of patterned grounds. This process, or the percolation of surface runoff after snowmelt, is also responsible for the formation of the so-called mud cutans (FitzPatrick, 1956, 1997; Kubiëna, 1970; Wilkinson & Bunting, 1975), formed by massive infiltration of unsorted silt and coarse clay (see Section 4; Fig. 13A). The preservation of the platy microstructure during summer in cryoturbated grounds shows that liquefaction is accidental and that most of the plastic deformation of layers at macro- and microscopic scales occurs just before the frost consolidation (Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1998).

# 3. Groundmass

# 3.1 Micromass

Striated b-fabrics, in particular poro- and granostriated (Fig. 9A), have been commonly documented in present or past frost-affected soils and associated with alternating

freeze-thaw (e.g., Morozova, 1965; Miedema, 1987) and other cryogenic processes (e.g., Konishchev et al., 1973, Konishchev & Rogov, 1977; Pecsi & Morozova, 1987; Tarnocai & Smith, 1989).

These b-fabrics correspond to the stress features (see Section 2.2) around cryogenic aggregates as described by Van Vliet-Lanoë (1976, 1982, 1985), who explains them as the result of the pressure exerted by growing ice crystals, inducing reorientation of fine material in the groundmass along pore surfaces or around aggregates. This interpretation has also been followed by Bunting (1983) and Fox (1983). However, striated b-fabrics alone cannot be considered diagnostic for frost activity because they can be produced by any type of stress, not necessarily exerted by the growing of ice crystals (Brewer & Pawluk, 1975). For instance, stress can be related to wetting and drying of clay-rich materials (Jamagne, 1972; Brewer, 1976).

# 3.2 Coarse Material

Vertically oriented grains (Fig. 10A and C) were already observed in early studies of frost-affected soils at both macroscopic and microscopic scales (Kaplar, 1965). A microstructure dominated by them is often called a 'succitic microfabric' (Fox & Protz, 1981). The vertical position results from pressure exerted by growing ice lenses on the coarse grains (e.g., rock fragments, bone fragments, fragments of clay coatings, charcoal fragments, nodules) in a frost-susceptible groundmass, which leads to rotation and gradual vertical alignment of the coarse grains, creating a system in which ice growth pressure is minimised. This process was suggested in an early study by Beskow (1935) and later experimentally confirmed by Kaplar (1965) and Pissart (1969). The presence of large open pores (see Section 2.1; Fig. 2) at the base of coarse fragments is a good indicator that this process can take place (Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1976; Fox & Protz, 1981). The fact that the coarse grain sets up a hydraulic barrier enhances the process (Van Vliet-Lanoë & Dupas, 1991). Nevertheless, frost jacking is always in competition with other displacement processes, such as solifluction and gravity-controlled processes, which may result in alignments with other (oblique) predominant directions (Fig. 10B) (Harris & Ellis, 1980; Harris, 1990).

Frost-shattered rock fragments (Fig. 11A) and coarse mineral grains in the ground-mass result from high moisture retention in fissures with subsequent ice growth. Fine particles are produced and loosened, especially if the rock is fractured by geological processes or weathered. This is particularly visible for soils on Arctic or alpine dolomitic limestones, in which the released silt-sized dolomite crystals form the micromass of many patterned grounds. Bones are also commonly fragmented in shards by frost (e.g., Todisco & Monchot, 2008). Frost shattering can also affect pedofeatures (Fig. 11B) such as nodules and coatings (Van Vliet-Lanoë & Langohr, 1983). Shattered grains can be further affected by other processes, such as dissolution, bioturbation and particle translocation (Van Vliet-Lanoë et al., 2004).

# 4. Pedofeatures

The most important pedofeatures associated with present or past alternating freeze and thaw are cappings of silt and coarse clay on coarse grains or peds, which are part of banded fabrics, as discussed in Section 2.1 (Fig. 12). They are usually called silt cappings and also correspond to the 'silt droplets' described by Romans and Robertson (1975). The thickness of these cappings varies between  $< 20~\mu \mathrm{m}$  and  $>1000~\mu \mathrm{m}$  on large grains, depending on various factors such as the rate of infiltration during ice melting in spring, the susceptibility of fine material to translocation, the size and continuity of the interpedal porosity and the presence of rocks fragments. Cappings are generally finely layered and may contain inclusions of coarse mineral grains, charcoal, pollen grains or excrements. They can also bridge several generations of older cappings or form link cappings that either overlie or are juxtaposed to those cappings. Silt and coarse clay cappings can be intact, or they can be fragmented by pedoturbation or more recent frost. They are rather resistant to collapse or dispersion because they were formed by flocculation, ultradesiccation and mechanical compaction, in contrast with cappings induced by simple washing in aridic soils or tills. They often survive the complete collapse of the original platy microstructure, remaining as undulating accumulations of fine material that are not visibly associated with the present pore system (Fig. 6). As mentioned in Section 2.2, silt cappings that initially formed along the upper surface of an aggregate or coarse grain may appear at its side or bottom because of frost- or thaw-induced rotation (Figs. 10C and 12C).

Organic residues, such as mosses or leaves fragmented by ice lensing into coarse silt-sized particles, can be translocated and form cappings on grains or aggregates (Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1987a; Van Vliet-Lanoë & Seppällä 2002; Todisco & Bhiry, 2008).

The partial or total superficial collapse of the soil at thaw promotes particle translocation from the surface horizons. This can occur as diffuse enrichment in the fine material of the groundmass (Schmertmann & Taylor, 1965; Forman & Miller, 1984;

Locke, 1986; Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1987b, 1988a) or as individual pedofeatures such as clay coatings and infillings. Thin coatings of illuviated fine silt or coarse clay ('mud cutans'; FitzPatrick, 1956, 1997; Kubiëna, 1970; Wilkinson & Bunting, 1975) around peds in subsurface horizons (Fig. 13A) and layered coatings and layered or cross-layered infillings of illuviated fine and coarse clay (Fig. 13B and C) have been documented in deeper horizons of freeze-thaw soils and attributed to liquefaction at the surface and/or fast percolation of surface runoff after snowmelt (Fedorova & Yarilova, 1972; McKeague et al., 1973; Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1988a; see also Kühn et al., 2010, 2018). Particle translocation is also enhanced by fast melting (liquefaction) and increased porosity (frost mulching) along the soil surface, as well as by rainfall (Frenot et al., 1995) or snowmelt (Wilkinson & Bunting, 1975). At depth, the accumulation of clay and silt leads to an increase in aggregate stability and consequently to the improvement of drainage and oxidation conditions, favouring the formation and preservation of coatings of clay and associated iron hydroxides. In stratified deposits, such as decalcified loess, iluviation below gentle slopes result, under repeated freeze-thaw, in the formation of a microbanded Bt horizon (Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1988a).

Illuvial features are preserved only in well-drained soils with limited water availability and thus limited ice segregation, and if they are formed below the lower boundary of active ice segregation (the frost limit or desiccated layer). However, fragments of illuvial clay coatings integrated in the groundmass (Fig. 14) are often observed in Bt horizons (e.g., Brewer, 1976; Van Vliet-Lanoë & Langohr, 1983). Both the fragmentation and the integration in the groundmass result from mechanical stress due to differential frost heave between the groundmass and the clay-rich pedofeatures. Identical processes are responsible for the 'conglomeric' fabric integrating rounded fragments in the groundmass as observed for some spodic horizons (Fox & Protz, 1981; Jakobsen, 1989; see Fig. 15B).

Microinjection features are infillings produced by slow upward injection of still unfrozen material along desiccation or thermal contraction fissures, which occurs at the

onset of soil freezing. The injected material may show deformed platy/lenticular or granular aggregates (Van Vliet-Lanoë et al., 1984). Their presence is related to lateral stress due to differential freezing rates and differential frost heave capabilities of the two materials. Microinjections are observed in all types of elongated voids in both modern and past environments (Van Vliet-Lanoë et al., 1984) subjected to repeated freezing and thawing. They have also been produced experimentally (Coutard & Mücher, 1985).

Increased salt concentration in the soil solution lowers the ice nucleation temperature, and liquid droplets may remain in the pores of the frozen soil enabling the crystallisation of salts independently from ice formation (Sweet, 1974; Ostroumov et al., 2001; Ostroumov, 2004). These authigenic silicates, carbonates and salt minerals (see also Mees, 2010, 2018; Mees & Tursina, 2010, 2018) occur as infillings, coatings or nodules. Although related to frost-induced desiccation, these features are not direct cryogenic pedofeatures (Sweet, 1974).

# 5. Implications for Pedostratigraphy

The micromorphological features discussed in this chapter are indicative of ice segregation, affecting soils in areas with and without permafrost, including aridic soils with available surface humidity (dew). They have no specific meaning in terms of environmental conditions, except the occurrence of frost activity at certain depths and in specific drainage conditions, but happening during very short (days) to very long periods (million years in permafrost). Specific horizons directly related to a permafrost thermal regime are, for instance, periglacial fragipans or foliated lodgement tills of formerly glaciated regions.

The impact of frost is often better expressed for cool periods than for very cold stages because water supply is essential for frost activity, whereby rainfall was higher during interglacial and interstadial periods than during glacial or stadial periods. Frost

diagenesis affecting pedofeatures, usually at the end of an interglacial or after soil burial, has often been documented (Morozova, 1965; Van Vliet-Lanoe, 1976, 1988a; Mermut et al., 1983; Mücher & Morozova, 1983; Tursina, 1985; Miedema, 1987; Bertran, 1989; Cremaschi & Van Vliet-Lanoe, 1990; Huijzer, 1993; Mestdagh, 2005; Boixadera et al., 2008; Rellini et al., 2014; Bertran et al., 2015). Disturbance is mainly associated with deep seasonal frost and generally with an oligotrophic soil status with weak dispersion of clays (Van Vliet-Lanoe, 1998), except where organomineral complexes are present (Ugolini et al., 1977).

The development of cryogenic fabrics affects other soil features, for which the formation is related to physicochemical and biological processes. The expression of frost activity depends on whether frost action occurred before, during or after the other processes. If frost disturbance took place before temperate pedogenesis, the classical micromorphological features of temperate climates, such as clay coatings, appear superimposed on former frost-induced features (Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1998; Mestdagh, 2005; Van Vliet-Lanoë & Morawski, 2008) such as lenticular cryogenic aggregates (Figs. 7B and 15A). In the case of alternating periods with more and less cold climatic conditions, the changes of pedogenic processes associated with them are reflected in thin sections by the presence of compound pedofeatures (Jakobsen, 1989; Van Vliet-Lanoë & Seppällä, 2002; Mestdagh, 2005; Van Vliet-Lanoë & Morawski, 2008; Pawelec & Ludwikowska-Kedzia, 2016). Some examples are compound coatings on lenticular aggregates (Fig. 15A), coarse mineral grains with thin coatings rich in organic matter and silt cappings (Fig. 15B), banded fabric development on former biogenic infillings (Fig. 15C), zones with a banded fabric integrated in the groundmass or iron hydroxide nodules cut by planar voids associated with a recently developed platy microstructure (Fig. 15D and E).

On the other hand, the enrichment or depletion of the groundmass in clay or organic matter, decalcification and porosity changes resulting from pedo-, bio- and cryoturbation induce local changes in water retention capacity, resulting in zones with different frost susceptibility occurring side by side. Deformation of aggregates produced by frost heave at the contact between materials with different frost susceptibilities (Fig. 16) has been commonly observed in thin sections (e.g., Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1998; Van Vliet-Lanoë et al., 2004).

# 6. Summary and Conclusions

Ground freezing is a pedogenetic agent among other soil-forming processes. It results in temperature-driven soil desiccation associated with the main process of ice segregation. The impact of this process depends on various soil characteristics (e.g., grain-size distribution, clay and organic matter content, soil moisture content, drainage) and on the temperature regime. The segregation of ice lenses results in the development of distinctive soil features, the most typical being platy and lenticular structures at various scales. In conditions of alternating freeze and thaw, the characteristic lenticular and platy microstructures occur together with more or less developed silt and coarse clay

cappings on lenticular aggregates and sorting of coarse grains, giving rise to different types of banded fabrics. Other micromorphological features related to ice segregation in soils are silt cappings on coarse grains, vertically oriented coarse grains, microinjection features, grano- and porostriated b-fabrics and granular microstructures. Freezing and thawing and solifluction processes further lead to compaction, displacement, rotation and deformation of the cryogenic features.

Cryogenic processes also have an effect on pore shape and size. The resulting change in porosity, composed of planes, vugs and vesicles, in turn affects the hydraulic conductivity of the soil after ice melt and thaw consolidation. Freezing combined with ice and snowmelt leads to the collapse of aggregates during thaw and hence to the translocation of fine particles and their accumulation in deeper horizons. Layered infillings of silt and coarse clay, indicating rapid translocation of fine material, are common. However, these illuvial pedofeatures are only preserved below the depth of seasonal frost penetration or in parts of the active layer that are dry in winter. In moist parts, they are rapidly incorporated to the soil by the frost-induced mechanical stress in winter.

Frost-induced microstructures are very typical and resistant. Their presence in palaeosols and in soils from warmer regions thus constitutes a valuable proxy for past climatic conditions.

# 1. Introduction

Vertic features result from shrink-swell processes, pedoturbation (or churning) and lateral shearing due to the alternating water regime in clayey materials. They are recognised for Vertisols and for various vertic soils that do not meet the requirements for this soil group or order. Cracking and pedoturbation are now believed not to be the most important but concomitant processes in the formation of vertic features by lateral shearing.

The World Reference Base for Soil Resources (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015) defines Vertisols as churning heavy clay soils with high proportion of swelling clays, deep cracks and a vertic horizon, the latter being a clayey subsurface horizon that, as a result of shrinking and swelling, has slickensides and wedge-shaped peds. In Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 2014), similar criteria are used, with mention of slickensides, pedality, clay content and cracks in the soil order definition.

Vertical features occur worldwide in swelling clay soils, from boreal to tropical environments, with alternating wet and dry periods. They occur under a variety of moisture and temperature regimes, landforms, ecosystems and crops, which influence and transform their macromorphological and micromorphological, physical and chemical attributes but retain the diagnostic features.

The major morphological markers of Vertisols are slickensides and wedge-shaped peds (e.g., Mermut et al., 1996a). Other relevant characteristics are a clayey texture, high density when dry, granular structure in surface horizons, blocky structure at subsurface levels, deep wide cracks, monotonous colour coupled with weak horizonation or discontinuous cyclic sequences interrupted by diapiric intrusions (or 'chimneys') of underlying material, gilgai, and pedogenic carbonate, iron-manganese oxide and gypsum segregations. Except for the slickensides, wedge-shaped aggregates and clayey texture, the mentioned characteristics may all not be present in Vertisols.

Vertical behaviour results in the development of specific micromorphological features that are observed in thin sections. Jongerius and Bonfils (1964) were the first to describe in detail the micromorphology of a Vertisol. Micromorphological investigations were subsequently performed worldwide as part of studies on Vertisol genesis and commonly presented at international meetings on Vertisols or soil micromorphology. Selected examples of papers describing vertical features in tropical, subtropical and boreal Vertisols are listed in Table 1. Since the 1990's, studies focused mainly on classification issues and on the understanding of stress phenomena.

A number of papers present an overview of the micromorphological characteristics of Vertisols and vertic features and their pedogenic interpretation (Nettleton & Sleeman, 1985; Mermut et al., 1988, 1996b; Blokhuis et al., 1990). Illustrations of vertic features in thin sections can also be found in the G.D. Smith Memorial slide collection (Eswaran et al., 1999).

The purpose of this paper is to review and summarise the available micromorphological information about vertic features, in Vertisols and in the vertic intergrades of other soil groups. The specificity of these soils is largely related to shrink-swell, churning and shearing processes, which strongly influence all aspects of the microfabric.

# 2. Microstructure

The main processes responsible for the formation of aggregates in soils with vertical properties are desiccation, shear failure and biological activity (Wilding & Hallmark, 1984).

At subsurface levels, a moderately to strongly developed angular blocky microstructure (Fig. 1) with prismatic peds is typical for vertic horizons and corresponds to the wedge-shaped, angular blocky, prismatic-blocky or prismatic pedality observed in the field. A hierarchy of microstructures with up to three hierarchical levels of peds is commonly observed for vertic horizons (Sui Yaobing & Cao Shenggeng, 1992). Subangular blocky (Figs. 1 and 2), massive and complex microstructures also occur.

The surface horizon (1-5 cm) of Vertisols may have a fine granular microstructure produced by repeated self-mulching, i.e., cracking and swelling (Nettleton et al., 1983; Dasog et al., 1991; Sui Yaobing & Cao Shenggeng, 1992; Mermut et al., 1996b). Mermut et al. (1988) noted the importance of rapid desiccation in the formation of a granular structure. Experiments have shown that in the course of successive wet and dry cycles the structure of the surface of a Vertisol gradually changes from massive to complex crumb, blocky and platy and that the size of the peds progressively decreases (Hussein & Adey, 1998). Development of a granular microstructure may contribute to the appearance of other vertic features. For instance, granular peds falling down cracks may lead to heterogeneity of the groundmass at the initial stage, which is homogenised in mature Vertisols (Kovda et al., 2016). Rounded (spheroidal) microaggregates were also described for vertic horizons of Turkish and Israeli Vertisols formed on different parent materials. Their development and preservation are linked to high vermiculite and palygorskite contents, high intrinsic structural stability and high hydraulic conductivity (Kapur et al., 1997) or to high calcium contents (Tsatskin et al., 2008).

Vertical features have been described for soils with swell-shrink behaviour in strongly continental environments with permafrost (Kovda & Lebedeva, 2013; Kovda et al., 2014, 2017). Specific for these Vertisols is the transformation of cryogenic granular and platy structures at the macroscopic level and especially at the microscopic scale, whereby development of planar voids within granular peds results in the formation of finer wedge-shaped aggregates (Fig. 3).

The degree of pedality and ped separation is usually strong in dry field conditions but changes to weak in wet soils. Intraaggregate microporosity is usually weakly developed, but planar voids separating peds are common. Planar voids (Fig. 4) dominate in the vertical horizon at a depth between 60 and  $160\mathrm{cm}$  (Blokhuis et al., 1990; Balpande et al.,

1997). Bui and Mermut (1989) found that the dominant orientation of planar voids is subhorizontal and oblique. It has been suggested that the frequency and orientation of planar voids could be used to distinguish between Vertisols and vertic subgroups (Mermut et al., 1988, 1996a). Comparative micromorphological studies of boreal and tropical Vertisols concluded that vughs were more common than planar voids in the boreal soils (Dasog et al., 1991), suggesting that swell-shrink and shearing processes are more active in tropical environments.

The characteristics and distribution of pores in Vertisols have been studied using image analysis (Puentes et al., 1992; Velde et al., 1996; Cabidoche & Guillaume, 1998, Moreau et al., 1999; Baer et al., 2009), but most of these studies were focused on the evaluation of image analysis techniques rather than on the characterisation of Vertisol porosity. However, image analysis has shown promising results in the assessment of compaction and subsequent structural regeneration of Vertisols (McKenzie et al., 1992; Pillai-McGarry, 1992).

Thin section preparation procedures may lead to structural changes in the clayey material. Freeze drying and critical point drying were compared, using SEM control, to find out which method of dehydration leads to more significant alteration of the microstructure (Bruand & Tessier, 1987; Tessier, 1987). It was observed that freeze drying gives rise to numerous microscopic cracks ( $1\mu \mathrm{m}$  wide). The critical point drying method modifies the microstructure less significantly, but it leads to a decrease in specimen volume.

# 3. Groundmass

Vertical horizons are mainly composed of clay with few coarse constituents. They usually have a dense groundmass with a double-spaced or open porphyric c/f-related distribution pattern. Fine monic c/f-related distribution patterns have been occasionally observed (Heidari et al., 2008).

Material from the surface horizons falls down the open cracks and is incorporated in deep horizons of the subsoil. In thin sections, this process can be recognised by a heterogeneous groundmass with incorporated dark aggregates (Fig. 5) or with materials of contrasting colour and composition occurring side by side (Fig. 6) (Mermut et al., 1996a; Kovda et al., 1999). Bioturbation can also explain the incorporation of abundant dark grains of surface-derived organic matter in the groundmass of deep subsurface horizons (Stephan & De Petre, 1986). Lateral shearing may lead to the lateral heterogeneity of the groundmass. These processes explain the complex morphology and soil cover pattern of some Vertisols (Wilding et al., 1990), especially in more wet conditions, and the strongly contrasting colours at the surface and in depth.

# 3.1 Coarse Fraction

Coarse material generally occurs in small amounts and rarely show relevant micromorphological features. Coarse grains can become fragmented by swell-shrink behaviour

of the soil, showing an increase in degree of fragmentation with decreasing depth (Rodriguez Hernandez et al., 1979). Phytoliths in deep subsurface horizons can be an indication of the incorporation of surface-derived material through the vertical cracks (Fig. 7) (Boettinger, 1994; Kovda et al., 1999).

Yaalon and Kalmar (1978) observed that some Vertisols exhibit, toward the surface, a coarsening of the sand fraction, although the high clay content remains unchanged with depth. Their explanation is that repeated cycles of wetting and drying resulted in textural differentiation by uplifting of the sand grains, which is most effective on grains entirely

embedded in the clayey groundmass. This process should be better expressed in older Vertisols formed along stable land surfaces with high content of swelling clays and relatively small amount of sand grains.

# 3.2 Micromass

# 3.2.1 Colour

A dark colour of the micromass is typical for many Vertisols and other soils with vertical properties. It has mainly been attributed to strong complexation between clay and organic matter (Singh, 1956). Bornand et al. (1984) considered the localisation of organic matter in relation to smectite layers and particles (quasicrystals), whereby a small part of the organic matter was found to have an external position and the main part has intraparticle localisation. Decomposition of organ and tissue residues may be responsible for the dark colour of the micromass (Fedorov & Soliyanik, 1991; Fedorov et al., 1991).

The colour of the fine material is strongly influenced by climate, parent material and carbonate content. Vertisols and vertic soils in arid and semiarid environments generally have a red-brown colour. In temperate or wet environments, they are often darker, which is generally attributed to high biological activity and high organic matter content (Dudal, 1965; Nordt et al., 2004). However, dark Vertisols can also be characterised by low biological activity and rare biological features (Fedorov & Soliyanik, 1991; Fedorov et al., 1991). Vertisols derived from basalt are usually dark. More than half of all grey, brown and red clayey Vertisols in Australia are dominated by illite and kaolinite (Norrish & Pickering, 1983).

# 3.2.2  $b$ -Fabric

Shrink and swell processes in soils result in microshearing, which leads to reorientation of the individual clay plates into planar zones with face-to-face alignment of clay domains (Wilding & Tessier, 1988). These zones correspond to streaks with striated b-fabrics, characteristic of vertic materials (McCormack & Wilding, 1974; Mermut et al, 1996a). Mono-, parallel, cross-, poro- and granostriated b-fabrics (Figs. 1B and 6B) occur together with speckled b-fabrics (Fig. 6B). Strial b-fabrics can characterise Vertisols at depth, where these soils developed on sedimentary parent materials (e.g., Mees, 2001). The local occurrence of materials with this b-fabric in BC and C horizons can be used to estimate the amount of sediment already converted to soil material (Dasog et al., 1987).

SEM studies have shown strong orientation of clay particles in vertic horizons and, on the other hand, a decrease in the size of oriented clay domains due to their breakdown by high pressures under swelling (Tessier et al., 1992). Field et al. (1997), using SEM, observed that structural units of a Vertisol were typically composed of small spherical and elongated aggregates  $(10 - 50\mu \mathrm{m}$  diameter). These aggregates are clearly visible in SEM images, but in thin sections they appear as a pattern of small strongly anisotropic and weakly anisotropic areas, which correspond to cross-sections through oriented clay features enclosing the aggregates.

Calcitic crystallitic b-fabrics are predominant in calcareous vertic horizons from arid and semiarid environments (e.g., Blokhuis et al., 1970; Bellinfante et al., 1974; Kalbande et al., 1992; Pal et al., 2001). In these soils, the presence of calcite in the groundmass masks the occurrence of striation (Wilding, 1985; Kalbande, 1988; Mermut et al., 1996b; Aydemir et al., 2004; Heidari et al., 2005, 2008). This is demonstrated by the better recognition of striated b-fabrics in decalcified thin sections (Wilding & Drees, 1990). The expression of b-fabrics can also be obscured by the dark colour of the micromass related to a high organic matter content (Yerima et al., 1987; Eswaran et al., 1988; Kovda et al., 1992) or by a poor orientation resulting from a small size of the clay particles (Eswaran et al., 1988).

Vertical horizons with distinct slickensides show well-developed, striated b-fabrics (Fig. 8) (Mermut et al., 1996a). In SEM images (Fig. 9A), slickensides are recognised as bright, smooth surfaces with microgrooves approximately  $0.3 - 20\mu \mathrm{m}$  wide, which are believed to be caused by the movement of coarse grains (Morgun Nobles et al., 2004). The thickness of the oriented clay along the slickenside surface is about  $3 - 4\mu \mathrm{m}$ . A decrease in shrink-swell and shearing intensity is reflected by weakening of the expression of striated b-fabrics in thin sections and by lowering of the brightness of surfaces in SEM images.

SEM observations permitted to distinguish two types of coatings associated with peds in vertic palaeosols (Shorkunov, 2013): (i) unidirectional 'shear coatings', which reflect both pressure and shearing processes (Fig. 9A) and which are similar to the slickensides described by Morgun Nobles et al. (2004), and (ii) 'pressure coatings', formed by repeated strong shrinking and swelling without shearing (Fig. 9B)

(see also Stoops & Mees, 2018). Features similar to 'pressure coatings' have also been observed for modern Vertisols (Kovda, unpublished data).

The degree of development of striated b-fabrics is affected by several factors. It seems to be greater in areas with high rainfall than in dry areas and to increase with increasing depth (Blokhuis et al., 1970). The same study indicates that the development of granostriated b-fabrics is influenced by the intensity of the churning process and by the size of the coarse grains.

A change in b-fabrics was also observed for Indian Vertisols formed along a climosequence extending from humid tropical to arid dry climates (Pal et al., 2009).

Despite the similar high shrink-swell potential, porostriated, parallel-striated and granostriated b-fabrics become less common and mosaic-speckled, stipple-speckled and crystallitic b-fabrics become better expressed in Vertisols of the drier climatic environments.

Attempts have been made to correlate b-fabrics with the shrink-swell potential of a soil measured by COLE values, whereby it was found that higher COLE values corresponded to better developed striated b-fabrics (Yerima et al., 1987). In turn, the shrink-swell potential of a soil is generally negatively correlated with the abundance of organic matter, carbonates, gypsum, iron-manganese oxides and low-activity clays and with electrolyte concentration (Mermut et al., 1991). Kalbande et al. (1992) found that weak swelling of clays, limited by chloritisation of smectite interlayers, was insufficient for the formation of a porostriated b-fabric and only resulted in either mosaic-speckled or granostriated b-fabrics. Based on variations in b-fabric, Kalbande (1988) suggested that shrink-swell processes are less pronounced in the presence of micritic calcite or coarse grains and in conditions with short dry periods.

Changes in b-fabric through wet/dry cycles were studied by Hussein and Adey (1998). They found that these changes were less well defined and more difficult to interpret than microstructure changes developed in the same conditions. The development of b-fabric generally decreased as the soil went through successive wet/dry cycles. b-Fabrics were better developed in vertical thin sections than in horizontal thin sections, suggesting that more clay orientation took place parallel to the wetting front. In this study, the b-fabrics were generally mosaic- to stipple-speckled with granostriation around large mineral grains and calcium carbonate nodules, and with weakly developed or absent porostriation.

The degree of development of vertic features may decrease in mature soils. Deep black soils on alluvium derived from weathered basalt, with typical properties of Vertisols except for the presence of slickensides, show only weakly developed poros-striated b-fabrics (Paranjape et al., 1997). In these soils, shrink and swell processes were operative, but their extent was not great enough to reorganise particles and produce b-fabrics typical for vertic horizons. Clayey smectite-dominated soils may need at least 550 years of shrinking and swelling before slickensides and striated b-fabrics can form (Paranjape et al., 1997). Other studies found that in smectite-dominated soils in very cold environments these features need less time (several decades) to form and become visible (Kovda & Lebedeva, 2013; Kovda et al., 2014, 2017).

Drying of unconfined soils does not produce significant reorganisation of clay domains because this requires a rather strong force. However, some methods of thin section preparation may create artificial stress that could enhance the development of shear-related b-fabrics (Blokhuis et al., 1990). This happens when moist clayey soil is dried quickly and/or when the resin is excessively heated during hardening  $(60 - 80^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ . Shear-related b-fabrics can also occur along the edges of a thin section, as a result of friction between the material and the sampling tool.

# 3.3 Pedofeatures

In comparison with the groundmass features discussed above, the type, distribution, orientation and abundance of pedofeatures in thin sections of vertic materials are much more variable, in function of the temperature and moisture regimes. They therefore provide useful information about environmental conditions.

# 3.3.1 Fe and Mn Oxide Pedofeatures

Fe and Mn oxide concentrations are very common in vertic horizons and Vertisols as a whole (Sleeman & Brewer, 1984; Blokhuis et al., 1990). The high water retention properties and low permeability of the dense clayey vertic materials are responsible for humid or water-saturated environments and consequently for the reduction and mobilisation of Fe and Mn, resulting in the formation of Fe and Mn oxide pedofeatures (see also Lindbo et al., 2010; Vepraskas et al., 2018).

The most common Fe and/or Mn oxide features are impregnative and intrusive nodules (Fig. 10) and poorly crystalline coatings and hypocoatings (Rodriguez Hernandez et al., 1979; Sleeman & Brewer, 1984; Blokhuis et al., 1990; Kovda et al., 1992; Nordt et al., 2004; Heidari et al., 2008). Concentric nodules (Fig. 10C) are typical for vertic horizons and are believed to reflect moisture regimes with repeated seasonal wet/dry cycles (Brewer, 1964; Van Ranst et al., 2011). Fe/Mn oxides followed by zeolite crystals in the pore system of palaeo-Vertisols were attributed to a transition from wetter to drier conditions during the evolution of these soils (Beverly et al., 2014). Image analysis and mapping with SEM/EDS analysis of rounded nodules in a young Vertisol from Texas have shown clear banding for Fe and Mn. Irregularly shaped nodules have patchy patterns for Mn with homogeneous Fe distribution. No banding for Al, Si, K, Ca or Ba was observed for any of the studied nodules (White & Dixon, 1996). Typic, aggregate or dendritic nodules (Fig. 10A, B and D), partly with gradual boundaries, have also often been described for vertic materials (Labib & Stoops, 1970; Buursink, 1971; Sleeman & Brewer, 1984). An upward increase in degree of fragmentation and dispersion of these pedofeatures has been reported (Rodriguez Hernandez et al., 1979).

The occurrence of abundant Fe and Mn oxide pedofeatures of various morphologies has been interpreted as evidence for prevailing wet conditions in the past (Blokhuis et al., 1969; Kabakchiev & Galeva, 1973). It indicates periodic anaerobic conditions and may occur in deep horizons of soils in both low and high parts of a gilgai landscape (Hallsworth & Beckmann, 1969). Backscattered electron images of thin sections show a large variability of size and shape of nodules within the clay matrix of Vertisols (Chittamart et al., 2010). SEM-EDS analysis of abundant nodules (smaller than  $6\mu \mathrm{m}$ ) in Vertisols from Argentina revealed their complicated structure and composition, with a combination of organic substances, sesquioxides and other absorbed compounds (Stephan et al., 1983). In addition, Fe/Mn oxide and magnetite nodules of bacterial origin were described for Vertisols (Chotte et al., 1994), emphasising the importance of investigating the distribution of soil microorganisms within soil pores and the relationships between microorganisms and mineral grains.

# 3.3.2 Carbonate Pedofeatures

Vertical horizons may be free of carbonates or may have soft (powdery) or hard (concretionary) carbonate segregations. In thin sections, hard carbonate nodules are generally micritic or microsparitic and usually have sharp boundaries. Calcite nodules can be orthic, disorithmetic or anorithmetic (Wieder & Yaalon, 1974). Acicular calcite, referred to as lublinite, may also occur inside voids (Dabbakula et al., 1992).

Hard nodules also often contain Fe and Mn oxide impregnations (Figs. 11 and 12), including dendritic Mn oxide occurrences (Blokhuis et al., 1969; Labib & Stoops, 1970; Kooistra, 1982a). Their sharp boundary has been attributed to churning processes, i.e., argilloturbation (Blokhuis et al., 1969; Wieder & Yaalon, 1974). It has also been considered an indication that nodules were no longer actively growing (Kovda et al., 2003; Nordt et al., 2004).

White and black carbonate nodules, with and without Fe/Mn oxide coatings, have been described for Indian and Sudanese Vertisols (Blokhuis et al., 1969; Rajan et al., 1972; Mermut & Dasog, 1986; Srivastava et al., 2002). Microsparitic or sparitic carbonate nodules with Fe/Mn oxide coatings and sharp boundaries have been interpreted as having formed elsewhere, followed by transportation and redeposition (Pal et al., 1999, 2001). Fe/Mn oxide coatings on hard carbonate nodules reflect a wetter environment and are often a relict feature (Mermut & Dasog, 1986). These coatings can protect carbonate nodules against recrystallisation, preventing rejuvenation of their radiocarbon age and changes in stable isotope geochemistry (Kovda, 2004).

Shrinking/swelling, lateral shearing and vertical churning have an impact on the morphology and location of carbonate pedofeatures. Many hard carbonate nodules are disorthic, whereas micritic soft carbonate masses may be elongated parallel to the shear

direction (planar voids or slickensides) (Podwojewski, 1995). Carbonate nodules may have a clustered or semibanded distribution parallel to planar voids or slickensides. Some bands were reported to be oriented at an angle of 45 degrees with the horizontal, indicating soil displacement through shear failure (Mermut & Dasog, 1986). Blokhuis et al. (1969) explained the peculiarities of hard carbonate nodules in Vertisols by their formation in the substratum and further upward transport, during which they acquired a subangular to rounded shape and also became harder. The Fe/Mn oxide impregnations and coatings on those carbonate nodules were also inherited from the substratum.

Micritic/microsparitic calcite coatings and hypocoatings in voids have been documented as well in horizons with vertic properties (Blokhuis et al., 1990; Kovda et al., 2003; Heidari et al., 2005).

Other carbonate nodules such as porous spherulitic aragonite accumulations and dolomitic or magnesitic micritic nodules, as well as barite aggregates, were described by Podwojewski (1995) for magnesium-rich Vertisols.

# 3.3.3 Gypsum Pedofeatures

Gypsum pedofeatures often occur in deep vertic materials in arid environments (Dudal, 1965; Sehgal & Bhattacharjee, 1988; Ahmad, 1996; Heidari et al., 2008). Compared with Fe/Mn oxide and carbonate pedofeatures, gypsum pedofeatures are less common. Various gypsum features have been described (Barzanji & Stoops, 1974; Podwojewski & Arnold, 1994; Podwojewski, 1995; see also Poch et al., 2010, 2018) with no indications about the relationship between those features and vertic characteristics. Gypsum can be inherited from the parent material or formed by early translocation processes of soluble constituents of the parent material by groundwater or soil solutions and even from ocean source (Barzanji & Stoops, 1974; Parfenova & Yarilova, 1977; Podwojewski & Arnold, 1994; Coulombe et al., 1996a).

# 3.3.4 Textural Pedofeatures

Textural pedofeatures, in particular illuvial clay coatings, are uncommon in Vertisols and horizons with vertic properties (Blokhuis, 1993). Nevertheless, they have sometimes been described (e.g., Osman & Eswaran, 1974; Verheye & Stoops, 1974; Mermut & Jongerius, 1980; Yerima et al., 1987; Dasog et al., 1991; Gunal & Ransom, 2006a, 2006b). Osman and Eswaran (1974) combined data on the percentage of clay coatings in thin sections with total clay contents and incipient flocculation ratios, concluding that clay translocation is an active process in Vertisols but that the evidence of clay translocation is continuously being destroyed by vertic processes. Textural pedofeatures are often fragmented and/or deformed and incorporated in the groundmass by shrink-swell and shearing processes (Fig. 2) (Nettleton & Sleeman, 1985; Yerima et al., 1987; see also Kuhn et al., 2010, 2018) and if present they may show a kink-band fabric instead of a continuous orientation (Stoops, 2003). They are more commonly found in deep horizons, where they are not disturbed by shrink-swell activity (Wilding & Drees, 1990).

Textural pedofeatures in Vertisols can be related to a former wetter environment or to a decrease in the activity of vertic processes, with the rate of illuviation exceeding the rate of destruction by churning processes (Nettleton & Sleeman, 1985). The development of clay coatings can also be due to ferrolysis in wet Vertisols that become very acid because of redox changes under alternating seasonal reduction and oxidation, resulting in clay disintegration in the upper part of the soil (Wilding, personal communication).

Illuvial clay coatings were observed in thin sections of smectite-rich horizons of buried palaeosols combined with porostriated and granostriated b-fabrics, but they were absent in parts with cross-striated b-fabrics (Gunal & Ransom, 2006a). A more recent review of tropical Indian Vertisols suggests that the presence of coatings of impure and weakly oriented clay in some Bss horizons results from long-term clay illuviation combined with low shrink-swell activity (Pal et al., 2012).

Deformed illuvial clay coatings may be very similar in appearance to porostriated b-fabrics originating exclusively from vertic soil behaviour, and the distinction between both types of features may require close investigation (e.g., Gunal & Ransom, 2006b).

Fe-rich clay coatings were observed for Canadian Vertisols and interpreted as resulting from weak pedoturbation in a subhumid boreal climate (Dasog et al., 1991). Also, minor clay illuviation and leaching of carbonates and/or gypsum were described for Australian grey and brown clay soils (Hallsworth & Beckmann, 1969).

Pedofeatures composed of silt, in the form of nodules and intercalations, were occasionally found in some Australian cracking clay soils, generally in the lower part of the profiles (Sleeman & Brewer, 1984). Infillings composed of sorted sand were also described for a vertic palaeosoil in India (Srivastava et al., 2010).

# 3.3.5 Excrements

Some authors consider the absence of excrement pedofeatures to be a typical feature of Vertisols, due to low biological activity (Fedorov & Soliyanik, 1991; Fedorov et al., 1991).

# 4. Degradation of Vertic Features in Cultivated Soils

Well-illustrated examples of how structure and porosity of Vertisols are affected by land use were presented by Coulombe et al. (1996b), showing that continuous and intensive cultivation results in the formation of a massive structure, an increase in bulk density and a lowering of continuity and connectivity of macropores. McGarry (1987, 1989) reported that structural degradation may extend to a depth of  $65\mathrm{cm}$  and result in the development of blocky, massive or platy microstructures in various parts of the profile. A comparison of the effects of wet and dry cultivation on soil structure and b-fabric using thin sections shows that cultivation of wet soils leads to better developed striated b-fabrics, mostly at a depth of  $5 - 20\mathrm{cm}$  (McGarry, 1987, 1989). This is related to the greater incidence, at this depth, of shearing of soil in a plastic state by tillage tools and tractor wheels. Other studies suggest that management practices, in general, did not lead to significant modifications, except for a change from a complex striated b-fabric in a

Vertisol under dry farming to a mostly parallel-striated b-fabric in an irrigated Vertisol (Kalbande et al., 1986).

Waterlogging is a major risk in irrigated Vertisols and results in changes of the type, location and abundance of pedofeatures (calcite, gypsum and Fe/Mn oxide occurrences; clay coatings; depletion pedofeatures). Dissolution of calcite and gypsum and their accumulation in deep horizons as calcite nodules and gypsum infillings were described for wet Vertisols (Kovda et al., 2003). Newly formed pedofeatures reflect a more humid soil environment by the larger size of the crystals and the presence of illuvial clay coatings and iron oxide nodules. Fe oxides occur as impregnative typic nodules and hypocoatings instead of concentric nodules. In irrigated soils, the total porosity and the degree of development of b-fabrics increase, microaggregation and intraaggregate porosity decrease, and the colour of the micromass in the surface horizon changes to lighter brown (Dostovalova & Tursina, 1988).

The reclamation of sodic Vertisols by adding  $\mathrm{CaCO_3}$  results in a change in aggregation, an increase in clay translocation and the dispersion of fine organic material (Bystritskaya et al., 1988). Experiments with Br and Brilliant Blue FCF dyes have shown that slickensides do not act as significant barriers for the penetration of solutes and chemicals into the groundmass (Morgun Nobles et al., 2004). Solutes penetrate into the soil both vertically along the cracks and laterally through the slickenside surfaces.

# 5. Vertic Features in Palaeosols

Diagnostic vertic features are usually well preserved and easily identifiable in palaeosols that are up to Archaean-Proterozoic and Cambrian in age (Retallack, 2008; Bandopadhyay et al., 2010) even in case of assumed weak and/or short duration of vertic pedogenesis (Tovar et al., 2014). Vertic features have been recognised and studied in palaeosols in several places worldwide (Matviishina, 1982; Gray & Nickelsen, 1989; Tsatskin & Chizhikova, 1990; Driese & Foreman, 1992; Joeckel, 1994, 1995; Tsatskin et al., 1998; Driese et al., 2003, 2008; Tabor & Montanez, 2004; Kovda et al., 2008; Martins & Pfefferkorn, 2008; Wieder et al., 2008; Diaz-Ortega et al., 2011; Beverly et al., 2014) and they have also been studied in archaeological contexts (Driese et al., 2013; Sánchez-Pérez et al., 2013).

In thin sections of vertic palaeosols, typical vertic features such as an open porphyric c/f-related distribution pattern, blocky or massive microstructures and striated b-fabrics are commonly observed (Driese et al., 2003; Kovda et al., 2008). Voids related to non-active slickensides sometimes show only weakly developed porostriated b-fabrics (Fig. 4) and can be filled with carbonates, gypsum and silt-sized quartz grains and have Fe/Mn oxide coatings. Typic and complex carbonate nodules with distinct sharp boundaries (disorthic) have been reported (Caudill et al., 1996; Dzenowski & Hembree, 2012). Clay coatings (Fig. 2) and fragments of clay coating, as well as a variety of Fe/Mn oxide nodules, carbonate nodules and other impregnative pedofeatures, have been described for vertic palaeosols (Tsatskin & Ronen, 1999; Kovda, 2004; Diaz-Ortega et al., 2011;

Dzenowski & Hembree, 2012). Concentric nodules with laminae composed of pure Mn oxides without any admixture of Fe compounds have been suggested to be associated with environments with high biological activity (Tsatskin & Ronen, 1999). Fragments of clay coatings were interpreted as illuvial pedofeatures fragmented by vertic processes (Díaz-Ortega et al., 2011). Several phases of carbonate precipitation and later recrystallisation have been documented in vertic palaeosols of various ages (Caudill et al., 1996; Kovda, 2004). The common occurrence of Vertic palaeosols, with a variety of pedofeatures that could not have developed simultaneously, suggests their polygenetic formation with the soil record of several evolutionary stages (Pal et al., 2001, Kovda et al., 2003; Sánchez-Pérez et al., 2013; Solis-Castillo et al., 2015).

Vertic palaeosols can provide additional information for environmental reconstructions because they undergo little burial compaction (less than  $10\%$ ) due to their high original density (Blodgett, 1985; Caudill et al., 1996, 1997). This fact was used to correlate the depth to the pedogenic carbonate horizon in Holocene Vertisols with the mean annual precipitation for estimating palaeoprecipitation values (Caudill et al., 1996; Nordt et al., 2006). The difficulties of this method are depth corrections for erosion and possible microrelief and/or subsurface cycling in the past. The wetter soil environments in the microlows and drier conditions in the microhighs complicate the estimation of mean annual precipitation for the area. Micromorphology could be helpful for identification of erosion and correlation with palaeomicrorelief.

Striated b-fabrics can not be used for the reconstruction of tropical or subtropical environments (with 4-8 dry months) or monsoonal climates, as done by some authors (Tsatskin & Chizhikova, 1990; Driese & Foreman, 1992; Beverly et al., 2014, 2015), because cold boreal Holocene Vertisols of continental climate zones may show the same features. Other micromorphological features of vertic materials can help the identification of various stages of palaeopedogenesis (see also Fedoroff et al., 2010, 2018).

Clayey materials such as palaeo-Vertisols may be one of the best substrates to preserve archaeological materials, but gilgai and/or subsurface cycling common to Vertisols should be taken into account during palaeoenvironmental reconstructions (Driese et al., 2013).

# 6. Conclusions

Research on the micromorphology of vertic features has been carried out since the 1960s. Vertic features, resulting from shrink-swell processes, vertical mixing and lateral shearing, due to alternating wetting and drying of clayey materials, are very prominent and rather easy to identify in thin sections.

Vertical materials show a characteristic combination of micromorphological features. The most relevant are striated b-fabrics, an open porphyric c/f-related distribution pattern, a blocky microstructure, a heterogeneous groundmass with incorporated dark aggregates, Fe/Mn oxide pedofeatures and, in more arid regions, carbonate and gypsum pedofeatures. However, classifying Vertisols and vertic subgroups of other soils based exclusively on their micromorphological characteristics is impossible (Blokhuis et al.,

1991; Mermut et al., 1991) because other clayey soils may be micromorphologically similar.

The micromorphological study of vertic features in modern soils and palaeosols can provide reliable information about the genesis and evolution of the soil and on long-term and short-term environmental changes and trends. Good indicators for the recognition of soils with vertic behaviour include the presence of surface-derived granular aggregates preserved in deep cracks or as part of a heterogeneous groundmass, as well as the occurrence of striated b-fabrics and abundant complex nodules. Nevertheless, more micromorphological studies are required for a better understanding of the preservation and diagenetic transformations of vertic features in palaeosols.

# 1. Introduction

Spodic materials are mineral soil materials generally associated with vertical and/or lateral translocation of organically complexed (cheluviated) forms of Fe and Al. Spodic features in soils are expressed in specific horizons: (i) eluvial horizons (E, albic), predominantly light-coloured intervals depleted of clay, base cations, Fe and Al, and mainly composed of residual quartz; (ii) illuvial spodic horizons (Bhs, Bs, Bhm),

reddish brown to brownish black depositional zones that have accumulated organic matter, Al, Fe and/or Mn; (iii) ortstein, composed of cemented spodic materials rich in organic matter and Al; and (iv) placic horizons, reddish brown cemented layers enriched in Fe with or without Mn.

The formation of spodic materials is principally controlled by specific biodegradation processes of the organic material, primarily facilitated by fungi. These processes favour the production of complexing organic acids that are preserved for a certain time and that are subjected to eluviation/illuviation. These specific biodegradation processes may be induced by cool and humid climatic conditions, seasonal subsurface groundwater, acid-producing vegetation (e.g., pines, subalpine fir, heath), quartz-rich and base-cation-depleted parent materials or a combination of two or more of these factors (De Coninck, 1983; McKeague et al., 1983; Jongmans et al., 1997; Lundström et al., 2000a). Formation, mobilisation and deposition of organo-metallic complexes are major soil-forming processes for occurrences of spodic features but are not requirements. For example, placic horizons are often associated with podzolisation but may develop in soils by redoximorphic and hydromorphic processes and consequently are not specific spodic features. Also, other processes besides organo-metallic cheluviation have been recognised in soils with spodic features. For instance, the translocation and illuviation of clay with and without organic materials has often been mentioned (Glinka, 1924; Fridland, 1958; De Coninck & Laruelle, 1960, 1964; De Coninck & Maucorps, 1972; Guillet et al., 1975; Condron & Rabenhorst, 1994; Li et al., 1998; Hseu et al., 2004) and the mobilisation of non-crystalline or nanocrystalline inorganic components (proto-imogolite allophane) has also been documented (Farmer et al., 1980, 1984, 1985; Kodama & Wang, 1989).

Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 1999, 2014) and the World Reference Base (WRB) (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015) recognise the spodic diagnostic horizon, composed predominantly of spodic materials, at their highest categorical levels, as the Spodosol order and Podzols Reference Soil Group, respectively; in this chapter the WRB term Podzols will be used for these soils. The albic diagnostic horizon appears in Soil Taxonomy, whereas the albic horizon is replaced by albic diagnostic materials in the 2015 WRB system. Classification uses the spodic subsoil horizon rather than the more variable and transient albic horizon or materials. Placic features are used in Soil Taxonomy at the great group level, whereas placic is a supplementary qualifier of the Podzols Reference Soil Group in the WRB. In the latter system, ortsteinic, as well as albic, is the principal qualifier of the Podzols Reference Soil Group. Spodic horizons can be found in soils other than Spodosols or Podzols. Spodic horizons can occur below thick  $(>2\mathrm{m})$  zones of well-expressed albic materials (giant podzols; e.g., Dubroeucq & Volkoff, 1988; Thompson et al., 1996; Van Herreweghe et al., 2003; D'Amico et al., 2015) in soils classified as Entisols in Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 2014) and Regosols in WRB (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015).

Soils with spodic materials occur mainly in temperate and boreal regions of the northern hemisphere, but also in specific areas in the humid tropics, the Arctic and in temperate mountainous regions of the southern hemisphere.

Micromorphological studies have been carried out for soils with spodic features, developed in a variety of parent materials in temporal and boreal climates of northern latitudes (e.g., De Coninck & Laruelle, 1960; Polteva & Sokolva, 1967; De Coninck & Righi, 1969; Righi, 1975, 1977; De Coninck, 1980; McKeague et al., 1983; Page, 1987a; Jakobsen, 1989; Sanborn & Lavkulich, 1989; Page & Guillet, 1991; Jersak et al., 1995; Gerasimova et al., 1996; Taina et al., 1997; Melkerud et al., 2000; Buurman et al., 2005; Kristiansen et al., 2010; Wallinga et al., 2013; Waroszewski et al., 2013), as well as in temperate to subtropical climates along the east coast of the United States (Rabenhorst & Hill, 1994; Condron & Rabenhorst, 1994; Phillips & FitzPatrick, 1999). Podzols are also found in the southern hemisphere (e.g., Bullock & Clayden, 1980; Farmer et al., 1985; Milnes & Farmer, 1987; Jamet et al., 1990; Liu et al., 1997; Sullivan, 1997; Van Ranst et al., 1997; Horbe et al., 2004; Hseu et al., 2004; Liu & Chen, 2004), but to a lesser degree due to warmer winters and drier climate (Lundström et al., 2000a).

In tropical areas, soils with spodic features were studied in coastal areas of Sarawak (Andriesse, 1970), in African lowlands with a thick quartz sand substrate (e.g., Schwartz et al., 1986; Schwartz, 1988) and at higher elevations in Rwanda (Van Ranst et al., 1997) and South Africa (Hawker et al., 1992). Under tropical rain forest, soils with thick albic and spodic horizons occur in progressive transition with Oxisols and are the result of an evolution of Oxisols (Ferralsols) into white sands. These Oxisol-Spodosol sequences were studied along slopes (Lucas et al., 1987; Bravard & Righi, 1989, 1990; Schaefer et al., 2002), in plateau areas where the Oxisol (Ferralsol) profile has been truncated and the lateritic crust removed (Horbe et al., 2004) and in tropical lowlands (Altemüller & Klinge, 1964; Dubroeucq & Volkoff, 1988, 1998; Thomas et al., 1999; Bardy et al., 2008).

Podzols on coarse volcanic material are found in the North Island of New Zealand (De Coninck & Rijkse, 1986), and Podzols on tephra-derived parent materials with characteristics of Andisols were studied in Japan and the northwestern United States (Shoji & Ito, 1990; Dahlgren & Ugolini, 1991). These soils with spodic features occur at higher elevation regions where cooler, moister conditions prevail with subalpine fir vegetation, while Andisols develop in the lower, drier climatic zones (McDaniel et al., 1993).

Micromorphology has been established as a fundamental tool to characterise spodic materials and to assist in determining the nature and sequence of pedogenic processes. Early morphological studies helped define the properties and genesis of albic and spodic horizons by illustrating the nature of the intact arrangement of illuvial materials (Kubiëna, 1938, 1953; Flach, 1960). De Coninck and co-workers (De Coninck et al., 1974; De Coninck, 1980; De Coninck & Righi, 1983; De Coninck & McKeague, 1985) used micromorphology to help elucidate the chemical processes of podzolisation. McKeague and his colleagues also made major contributions toward understanding of spodic features, studying the pedogenesis of soils in Canada, especially of ortstein and Fe/Mn pans (McKeague et al., 1968; Brewer et al., 1973; McKeague & Sprout, 1975; Wang et al., 1978; McKeague & Wang, 1980; McKeague & Kodama, 1981).

Non-destructive microanalysis techniques, including EDS and WDS analyses, have enabled examination of the composition of constituents of cementing materials and the spatial distribution of elements in spodic horizons and ortstein (Lee et al, 1988; Schaefer et al., 2002; Horbe et al., 2004; Kaczorek et al., 2004) and in placic horizons (Righi et al, 1982; Breuning-Madsen et al., 2000; Jien et al., 2010). Micromorphological studies in combination with other types of chemical analyses have provided new results on the constitution and origin of organic matter in spodic materials, resulting in new concepts of Spodosol or Podzol formation (Buurman et al., 2005, 2008; Buurman & Jongmans, 2005).

# 2. Spodic Horizons and Ortstein

Spodic horizons are typically black (Bh horizons) or dark reddish brown to brown (Bs or Bhs horizons), reflecting deposition of various types of organic materials, organometallic complexes and Fe oxides. Darker spodic materials, richer in organic matter, typically accumulate above redder materials, rich in Fe and Al oxides (De Coninck et al., 1974; Bullock & Clayden, 1980). Spodic horizons have been intensively studied over a long period and different theories for their formation have been proposed. Conceptually, organic (fulvic) acids with relatively high molecular weight (HMW) that are leached from the O horizon form complexes with Al and Fe. These initially unsaturated organo-metallic complexes migrate through the soil and precipitate because of continuing addition of metals during the downward migration, until a certain carbon/metal ratio has been reached, causing the complex to precipitate and thus creating a spodic B horizon (McKeague et al., 1971; De Coninck, 1980). An alternative depositional process is microbial decomposition of organic ligands, mainly in the form of acids with low molecular weight (LMW), during downward migration, releasing ionic Al and Fe to the soil solution and resulting in the formation of Al-Si-OH and Fe-OH solid phases (Lundström, 1993; Lundström et al., 1995, 2000a). It has been hypothesised that metal-LMW acid complexes are transported by hyphae from the E horizon to the O layer, where Fe and Al are partly released and then complexed by HMW acids (Lundström et al., 2000b). Other theories of spodic horizon formation include eluviation and precipitation, or in situ formation, of protoimogolite sols in Bs horizons followed by adsorption of mobile humus (Farmer et al., 1980; Anderson et al., 1982; Ugolini & Dahlgren, 1987), rather than involving formation of allophane-related phases through alteration of illuvial organo-mineral complexes (Farmer, 1982; Farmer et al., 1984, 1985). Besides a possible combination of various processes of spodic material deposition, the origin of the organic fraction is currently also considered to be varied, with dissolved organic matter (predominantly in poorly-drained Podzols) and decomposed root-derived material (predominantly in well-drained Podzols) as possible sources (Buurman & Jongmans, 2005; Buurman et al., 2013). Organic components are stabilised and the resistance to decomposition or biodegradation is increased by complexation with metals as well as

by the presence of nanocrystalline minerals (Phillips & FitzPatrick, 1999; Buurman & Jongmans, 2005).

Ortstein (Bhsm, Bsm) is a black to dark brown, cemented layer rich in spodic materials (Wang et al., 1978; Freeland & Evans, 1993), defined as a diagnostic subsurface horizon in Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 1999, 2014). Ortstein is generally composed of translocated complex organo-mineral materials principally associated with Al (McKeague & Wang, 1980; McHardy & Robertson, 1983; Lee et al., 1988; Phillips & FitzPatrick, 1999). Other cementing agents such as Fe and Mn oxides and protoimogolite allophane have been identified (Polteva & Sokolova, 1967; McKeague & Kodama, 1981; Farmer et al., 1984, 1985; Ross et al., 1989; Thompson et al., 1996; Kaczorek, et al., 2004). The colour of the horizon is generally linked to the relative amounts of Fe and Mn oxides and organic carbon. Gibbsite can form from degradation of organic ligands of the Al-organic-matter complex in ortstein horizons of sandy hydromorphic Podzols (Righi & De Coninck, 1977). The formation of ortstein is related to the eluviation/illuviation of spodic materials and can occur in both well-drained and poorly-drained soils (McKeague & Wang, 1980). Vertical eluviation/illuviation is most commonly enhanced by lateral translocation of organic and/or mineral compounds, induced by groundwater dynamics (Karavayeva, 1968; De Coninck et al., 1991). Ortstein can occur as prominent subhorizontal bands, resulting from lateral movement of soil water containing dissolved organic matter, which tends to follow stratification in the parent material (Buurman et al., 2013). Ortstein formation can begin as nodules (Polteva & Sokolova, 1967), subsequently forming a continuous accumulation of organo-mineral coatings that cement mineral grains and result in decreased biological activity (De Coninck et al., 1974, 1986; Van Ranst et al., 1997). The degree of hardness or cementation is related to the distribution of the illuvial organometallic complexes around coarse mineral grains and the infilling of pore space (McKeague & Wang, 1980; McHardy & Robertson, 1983; Rabenhorst & Hill, 1994). This is in turn influenced by texture, as coarser materials and lower void content require less number of agents for cementation (McKeague & Sprout, 1975; Righi, 1987).

# 2.1 Microstructure and c/f-Related Distribution Patterns

Spodic horizons are generally characterised by a basic microstructure, most accurately described in terms of their c/f-related distribution patterns. The typical gefuric, chitonic and enaulic c/f-related distribution patterns (according to Stoops, 2003) (see further) correspond to bridged grain, pellicular grain and intergrain microaggregate microstructures (according to Bullock et al., 1985).

The c/f-related distribution patterns in spodic horizons vary widely and reflect both the size of the coarse mineral components and the composition of the micromass (De Coninck & McKeague, 1985). The c/f-related distribution pattern may range from gefuric, chitonic (Fig. 1) or enaulic to porphyric (Fig. 2). Gradual differences in c/f-related distribution pattern, from gefuric to porphyric, can be viewed as an evolutionary

sequence of increasing accumulation of illuvial spodic materials (Pawluk, 1983). In an Oxisol-Spodosol (Ferralsol-Podzol) landscape, Bravard and Righi (1990) found that the c/ f-related distribution patterns evolved from porphyric in the Oxisol (Ferralsol) on the plateau to enaulic, and finally to chitonic in the Spodosol (Podzol) on the footslope. Elemental and mineralogical similarities suggested a genetic link between the soils although they were classified in different and contrasted orders.

Individual thin sections may exhibit more than one distribution pattern, and intergrades of these fabrics are possible (e.g., chito-gefuric). The differences in c/f-related distribution patterns as well as in composition of the micromass result in different grades of consistency, ranging from friable to cemented. Spodic horizons with continuous or patchy cementation have chitonic and/or gefuric to porphyric c/f-related distribution patterns (see Fig. 7) and common vughs and planes (Rabenhorst & Hill, 1994; Phillips & FitzPatrick, 1999; Kaczorek et al., 2004).

Friable, sandy-textured spodic horizons have been described as having chito-gefuric (Schaefer et al., 2002) as well as enaulic c/f-related distribution patterns (Rabenhorst & Hill, 1994). The gefuric c/f-related distribution pattern may grade to enaulic as aggregates develop with increasing amounts of monomorphic organic material (see Section 2.3) (Salem Avad et al., 1982). Abundant complex packing voids are common between coarse sand grains, especially in the upper part of spodic horizons (Phillips & FitzPatrick, 1999). Aggregates (Fig. 3) are irregular to ovoid-shaped. Well-developed cappings and link cappings on the upper surfaces of the larger grains or rock fragments have been frequently observed for spodic horizons. The stratification of these cappings, in the form of silt-clay segregation, is presumably due to frost action and gelifluction (Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1998), emphasising the polygenetic character of some of these horizons (Phillips & FitzPatrick, 1999). Oriented fine sand/silt cappings and cryoturbation features (e.g., wedge-cast-like figures, platy microstructures) created during cold periods have been observed for relict Podzols in Alpine regions (D'Amico et al., 2015).

Silty or loamy spodic horizons commonly have a crumb microstructure (Fig. 4) or an equal to coarse enaulic c/f-related distribution pattern, with large (up to several millimetres in diameter), irregularly shaped, porous aggregates, composed of small, more or less coalescent granules. Some loamy spodic horizons have a subangular blocky microstructure and chitonic to porphyric c/f-related distribution patterns (Hseu et al., 2004).

# 2.2 Coarse Material

Micromorphological data on coarse material are rather scarce for spodic horizons, as they are predominantly formed in quartz-dominated parent materials, whose main mineral component contributes little to soil development.

The evolution of glauconite and its impact on the formation of spodic materials have been studied for Podzols of northern Belgium (De Coninck & Laruelle, 1960) and northern France (De Coninck & Maucorps, 1972). Glauconite is strongly weathered during podzolisation, undergoing transformation to swelling clay minerals as well as partial to complete dissolution.

Most published data refer to comparative studies of weathering of minerals in albic materials and spodic horizons (e.g., Fedoroff et al., 1977). Microprobe and SEM analyses have shown that feldspar grains in the albic materials exhibit a wide variety of dissolution features (prismatic etching pits), with Ca-feldspar being more severely etched than other feldspar types (Cruickshank et al., 1990).

Melkerud et al. (2000) noted, through thin section point-counting, an increase in weathering of plagioclase, alkali feldspar and biotite toward the surface of Podzols from northern Europe. Biotite is present in spodic B horizons as both fresh mineral grains and as exfoliated altered grains stained by Fe oxides, but it is absent in the overlying albic materials. The weathering rate of minerals is generally lower in spodic horizons than in E horizons because mineral grains are protected by Fe or Al oxides and organo-metallic complexes (McKeague et al., 1983).

The opposite trend was observed for quartz grains from a tropical Spodosol, as the result of the seasonal influence of groundwater and the greater water-holding capacity in the spodic horizon than in the E horizon (Marcelino & Stoops, 1996).

Jongmans et al. (1997) were the first to describe tunnel-like features within feldspar and hornblende grains of E horizons of Podzols. These features are different from (coalesced) etch pits and are assumed to be created by fungal hyphae (see also van Breemen et al., 2000; Hoffland et al., 2002). In feldspar, they were found to be concentrated in the uppermost centimetres of the E horizon (Hoffland et al., 2002), and they were observed more frequently for older Podzols (Hoffland et al., 2002; Smits et al., 2005), with differences between plagioclase and K-feldspar (Smits et al., 2005). Fungal weathering, without tunnel development, has also been studied for phyllosilicate minerals, using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) (McMaster, 2012). Mineral horizons of boreal forest Podzols are intensively colonised by mycorrhizal mycelia, which transfer protons and organic metabolites to mineral surfaces, resulting in mineral dissolution (Rosling et al., 2009).

# 2.3 Fine Organic Material

The fine organic material in spodic horizons and ortstein results from either in situ transformation of plant remains or illuviation. Two main types of secondary organic fine material may be observed, i.e., polymorphic and monomorphic material (De Coninck et al., 1974).

# 2.3.1 Polymorphic Material

This material is organised as porous aggregates consisting of accumulations of biologically and chemically decomposed fine organic material, limited amounts of clay- and silt-sized mineral grains and coarse organic elements with a recognisable cell or tissue structure. The material is very dark brown to black and occurs primarily in the A horizon and the upper part of B horizons where soil microorganisms are active (e.g., De Coninck et al., 1974, 1986; Buurman et al., 2005). This microbial activity is most intense near roots (Page, 1987b), with high fine root turnover rates (Sanborn & Lavkulich, 1989). Roots are mechanically and biochemically fragmented and transformed by soil mesofauna and microbial activity. These transformations result in multiple forms of degraded plant material (hence the name), including excrements (De Coninck & Righi, 1969; Eswaran et al., 1972; De Coninck et al., 1974, 1986; Righi & De Coninck, 1974; Robin & De Coninck, 1978; De Coninck, 1983).

Crumbs (Fig. 4) or granules of polymorphic material impart a loose and friable consistency to soils, also called 'pellety' (Eswaran et al., 1972; Bullock & Clayden, 1980; McHardy & Robertson, 1983; Gerasimova et al., 1996; Van Ranst et al., 1997; Li et al., 1998). These aggregates (pellets) may coalesce, evolving to a vughy or spongy mass of interlocking dense to very dense microaggregates in the lower B horizon (Phillips &

FitzPatrick, 1999). These transformations are generally regarded as biological, but physicochemical processes may influence polymorphic forms as well (Bruckert & Selino, 1978; Phillips & FitzPatrick, 1999). Buurman et al. (2005) categorised the arrangement of polymorphic aggregates as single, welded, strongly welded and flowed. They considered an increase in welding as a sign of abundant microbial and chemical decay of organic components.

Polymorphic materials typically occur in the presence of roots and can also form coatings without cracks on coarse sand grains (Robin & De Coninck, 1978). Faunal activity is the process that incorporates and mixes plant residues and silt-sized materials (Fig. 5). Elemental microprobe analysis shows that the bulk of structural aggregates are enriched with Al, suggesting that illuvial Al-organic-matter complexes are a substantial part of the material constituting polymorphic organic matter (Righi, 1977; Righi & De Coninck, 1977; Robin, 1979; Van Ranst et al., 1980).

Depending on their degree of decomposition, plant tissue residues in aggregates of polymorphic organic matter as well as aliphatic and poorly condensed organic compounds (fulvic acids) exhibit a more or less strong primary fluorescence when viewed with blue or ultraviolet (UV) light (Van Vliet et al., 1983; Altemüller & Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1990).

# 2.3.2 Monomorphic Material

This constituent is the primary spodic material of cemented spodic horizons or ortstein, resulting from the processes of mobilisation, transport and precipitation of illuvial organic matter (De Coninck et al., 1974; Righi & De Coninck, 1974; Righi, 1977; De Coninck & Righi, 1983; De Coninck & McKeague, 1985). The deposit is regarded as a precipitate of dissolved organic compounds that were water-transported (Buurman et al., 2005). Monomorphic material is composed of uniform colloidal-sized materials without coarse organic elements or microvoids (De Coninck, 1980). SEM examination reveals randomly stacked, small bodies of material (Van Ranst et al., 1980). It forms coatings on mineral grains (Fig. 6) and covers pre-existing organic features (polymorphic aggregates, plant remains) (De Coninck et al., 1974). The illuvial nature of this amorphous material is inferred from its presence as coatings in vertical channels and on coarse grains, and as deposits that bridge those grains (De Coninck et al., 1974, 1986; Robin & De Coninck, 1978; Van Ranst et al., 1980, 1997; Buurman et al., 2005). The material has a limpid aspect and its colour can range from black to reddish or yellowish brown. It is initially a gel but undergoes a transition from a liquid or dispersed phase by dehydration and solidification (De Coninck & McKeague, 1985). It becomes increasingly hydrophobic and typically exhibits polygonal cracking when dry, which is evident in both air- and oven-dried material (Fig. 7). Lack of a cracking pattern may be due to continuously moist conditions (Sanborn & Lavkulich, 1989). Monomorphic material may exhibit angular cracking, with detachment from the coarse grain surface (Van Ranst et al., 1980; De Coninck et al., 1986; Lee et al., 1988; McSweeney & FitzPatrick, 1990; FitzPatrick, 1993; Van Herreweghe et al., 2003). Except for areas that contain Al-organic-matter complexes, it is generally black under UV light (Jamet et al., 1990; Altemüller & Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1990; Thompson

et al., 1996). In comparison with polymorphic organic matter, monomorphic materials are mainly composed of compounds with more aromatic and condensed molecular structures (humic acids), which strongly absorb blue and UV light without provoking fluorescence.

Monomorphic material is abundant in the lower part of the spodic B horizon, which is also characterised by the absence of recognisable fresh plant remains and roots. It is the most common form of organic material in hydromorphic Podzols (Buurman & Jongmans, 2005; Buurman et al., 2008; Kristiansen et al., 2010). However, Coelho et al. (2012) observed polymorphic organic matter and/or plant residues in different decomposition stages as most important soil features in spodic horizons of poorly-drained soils of a coastal tropical forest area. In these soils, in situ root decomposition by mesofauna and microorganisms is an important mechanism of organic matter accumulation in the deeper B horizons.

Elemental microprobe analysis shows that monomorphic material is composed of organo-Al or Al/Fe compounds with little Si (Fig. 8) (Righi, 1975; Van Ranst et al., 1980; De Coninck & McKeague, 1985; Thompson et al., 1996; Phillips & FitzPatrick, 1999). The lack of silica implies that clay minerals are absent.

# 2.3.3 Occurrence

Soil hydrology is an important factor in organic matter dynamics (Buurman & Jongmans, 2005). Microbial and mesofaunal activity increase the formation of polymorphic organic material in well-aerated horizons. Micromorphological evidence shows that the principal form of secondary organic materials is polymorphic in the A horizon and well-drained B horizons, where root activity is common (De Coninck,

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/1f470503-4713-459a-b94a-6289d3cace8d/3cf3d4ea1011338edb5d8f1286d2cacde653036fe43ae8bd8a287c2636003123.jpg)

1980). In spodic B horizons, the bulk of the polymorphic materials are likely formed from in situ decomposition of roots that have followed the nutrient source into lower horizons (De Coninck, 1980; Van Ranst et al., 1997). Monomorphic materials dominate in lower B horizons or those horizons influenced by groundwater. Translocation of the dissolved organic compounds that constitute monomorphic materials can occur both vertically and laterally (Buurman & Jongmans, 2005; Buurman et al., 2005, 2008).

In general, polymorphic and monomorphic materials can form simultaneously in the soil (De Coninck et al., 1974; Brandon, et al., 1977; Buurman & Jongmans, 2005; Kristiansen et al., 2010). However, a preponderance of monomorphic organic material generally indicates a more advanced stage of podzolisation, with an increase in the amount of illuvial Al/Fe-complexes. Active processes of plant fragmentation by mesofaunal activity and biodegradation of plant residues create a polymorphic structure within a spodic horizon. If illuvial organo-metallic complexes are subsequently deposited, progressive cementation of the horizon will result in an increasingly higher amount of monomorphic forms. In turn, this accumulation results in the reduction of root development and faunal activity (De Coninck, 1980). Pervasive accumulation of monomorphic material in a horizon eventually leads to formation of the ortstein layer, especially in coarse-textured material (Righi, 1987).

The fine material of cemented horizons or nodules is brown or reddish brown to black with a generally undifferentiated b-fabric. It is commonly composed of monomorphic organic material enriched in Al, although it may contain non-crystalline material rich in Fe or Mn and complex polymorphic organo-mineral materials (Karavayeva, 1968; Miles et al., 1979; McKeague & Wang, 1980; Van Ranst et al., 1980; McHardy & Robertson, 1983;

Arocena & Pawluk, 1991; Rabenhorst & Hill, 1994). Nodules in a Canadian Spodosol or Podzol were identified to also contain polymorphic organic matter where active decomposition of organic materials by fungi prevented the dominance of monomorphic forms (Arocena & Pawluk, 1991).

Clay illuviation has been often recognised in soils with spodic features (e.g., De Coninck & Maucorps, 1972; Alekseyev, 1983; Liu et al., 1997; Li et al., 1998; Liu & Chen., 2004). Monomorphic organic material can occur as coatings that cover illuvial clay or polymorphic organic material (Fig. 6) (McKeague & Wang, 1980; Rabenhorst & Hill, 1994; Hseu et al., 2004; Kaczorek et al., 2004). This process is generally thought to occur sequentially in pedogenesis rather than simultaneously with spodic horizon development (e.g., Guillet et al., 1975; Condron & Rabenhorst, 1994).

In a region with associated Oxisols (Ferralsols) and Spodosols (Podzols), Schaefer et al. (2002) identified buried A horizons that subsequently have undergone organomineral illuviation and are currently interpreted as Bh horizons. In this study, micromorphological examination of organo-Fe/Al deposits in a Bh horizon provided evidence of active podzolisation processes taking place in the lower landscape positions.

# 2.4 Nanocrystalline Aluminosilicates

Nanocrystalline aluminosilicates (e.g., proto-imogolite allophane) have been identified in the fine material of spodic materials by means of selective dissolution, TEM observations and infrared spectroscopy (Farmer et al., 1980; McKeague & Kodama, 1981; Childs et al., 1983; Gustafsson et al., 1995; Lundström et al., 2000b). These compounds, as well as Al-polymers and Al-organic-matter complexes, are fluorescent under UV illumination (e.g., Altemüller & Van Vliet-Lanoö, 1990; Thompson et al., 1996).

The migration of aluminosilicates in Bs horizons is suggested by root pseudomorphs in which the cell wall structure is preserved in the allophanic material and by allophanic coatings covering sand grains (Farmer et al., 1984, 1985). Results presented by Milnes and Farmer (1987) suggest that allophane and organic matter are deposited separately and that gibbsite formed from Al-rich gels before the main allophane deposition phase in humus iron Podzols. Several generations of allophanic deposits are recognised, with evidence of dissolution of earlier phases by percolating waters. These observations support the views of Anderson et al. (1982) and Farmer (1982) that allophane accumulation in spodic B horizons is not controlled by illuviation and precipitation of organic matter. Kodama and Wang (1989), using selective dissolution and differential X-ray diffraction (XRD), identified opaline silica, proto-imogolite allophane and ferrihydrite in Canadian Podzols. Proto-imogolite allophane has been also cited as a contributor to pan formation in Australian Podzols and its occurrence was attributed to a previous soil-forming regime (Thompson et al., 1994, 1996). Interlayering of

nanocrystalline aluminosilicates and organic materials, documented in the fine material of ortstein and other hardened spodic materials, suggests that multiple episodes of deposition are responsible for the formation of these occurrences (Farmer et al., 1984).

# 3. Related Horizons

# 3.1 Surface Horizons

O and A horizons are important sources of organic materials, including organic acids, and of soluble inorganic elements. Fabrics of O horizons of Podzols under forest vegetation are not unique to that order, but are typical of mor (raw humus) or moder (organic materials with varying degrees of decomposition partly mixed with inorganic components) (see also Stolt & Lindbo, 2010; Ismail-Meyer et al., 2018), with little incorporation of mineral material along the forest floor (De Coninck & McKeague, 1985; Sanborn & Lavkulich, 1989). The composition of O horizons depends on the type of material; the degree of degradation by fungi, bacteria and soil fauna; and the degree of decomposition and rearrangement (De Coninck et al., 1974; Phillips & FitzPatrick, 1999; Buurman et al., 2005).

Microscopic organic matter occurrences in O horizons of soils with spodic features range from recognisable fresh organ tissue and cell residues of plants to unrecognisable organic fine materials (including punctuations and organic pigments) (De Coninck et al., 1974; Van Ranst et al., 1997; Stoops, 2003; Hseu et al., 2004). Woody detritus and roots, often reduced to a melanised ring enclosing excrements, typically comprise the bulk of the O horizons (De Coninck & McKeague, 1985; Sanborn & Lavkulich, 1989). Fungal material, in the form of hyphae, sclerotia and mycorrhizal sheaths, is quite common. Fungi often penetrate into excrements, causing partial disintegration (De Coninck et al., 1974), and they also cause biochemical alteration of plant tissue. Excrements occur in various shapes and sizes, fresh or more or less transformed, and they increase in abundance with depth in the O horizon. The accumulation of organic material indicates microbial activity and consumption of plant remains by earthworms, enchymraeids, beetle larvae or mites (Phillips & FitzPatrick, 1999) (see also Kooistra & Pulleman, 2010, 2018). The organic O horizons may lie directly over albic soil materials, as in many boreal Podzols (e.g., Melkerud et al., 2000; Schaefer et al., 2002), or they may grade into an A horizon (e.g., Bravard & Righi, 1989; Van Ranst et al., 1997; Phillips & FitzPatrick, 1999).

A horizons generally have a dark grey to black colour and a 'salt-and-pepper' appearance in the field (Bullock & Clayden, 1980), due to a mixture of discrete, light-coloured mineral grains (generally quartz) and dark small organic particles. In many cases, excrements originally in O horizons enter the underlying mineral soil as channel

infillings, composed of aggregates. In thin sections, black organic materials are generally highly decomposed, consisting of vegetal remains and amorphous fine organic materials. Plant remains are generally strongly fragmented but recognisable. The microstructure is spongy or granular, with a high total porosity (e.g., Van Ranst et al., 1997; Hseu et al., 2004). Fine and coarse granules may form from a combination of clay or silt particles with root remains and/or excrements (Phillips & FitzPatrick, 1999). Part of the plant remains and excrements are transformed into polymorphic organic matter (Robin & De Coninck, 1978; De Coninck, 1983). The c/f-related distribution pattern is coarse monic to enaulic and the soil is highly porous. It generally consists of loosely packed, mostly uncoated sand-sized grains, organic residues with various degrees of decomposition and loose aggregates of organic fine material (e.g., De Coninck & McKeague, 1985). The c/f-related distribution pattern is determined by the relative silt, clay and humus content, components that form aggregates of fine material between the sand-sized coarse grains (Phillips & FitzPatrick, 1999).

# 3.2 Eluvian Horizons and Albic Materials

Albic materials and eluvial (E) horizons are typically light grey, reflecting the absence of clay, Fe oxides and organic constituents (e.g., Melkerud et al., 2000). Iron depletion may result from reduction and dissolution of Fe oxides if water saturation occurs, as redox- morphic processes may be involved in the formation or expression of albic materials (Van Ranst et al., 1997; Hseu et al., 1999; Buurman et al., 2005; Wu & Chen, 2005). A second pale eluvial horizon (possibly albic materials) may occur beneath the spodic horizon, as the result of groundwater moving laterally or perching on an argillic, fragipan or placic horizon (Bullock & Clayden, 1980).

The thickness of eluvial horizons increases during soil development, extending into the upper B horizon. Formation of these horizons results from mineral dissolution and chelation of Fe and Al by complexing agents such as short-chain aliphatic and aromatic acids, followed by organo-metallic eluviation and/or microbial decay of the remaining organic matter at the boundary between the E and B horizons leaving only the most resistant compounds (Melkerud et al., 2000; Lundström et al., 2000b; Buurman & Jongmans, 2005; Buurman et al., 2013). Buurman et al. (2005) regarded microbial decomposition of organic matter, following removal of metals, as the principal mechanism in E horizon formation (rather than eluviation of organic materials) and indicated that the loss of Al increased the palatability of the remaining organic materials for microbes. E horizons are considered to be, in part, derived from former spodic B horizons by eluviation of organic matter, as witnessed by the presence of remnants of monomorphic coatings (Buurman et al., 2008). Thin Fe oxide coatings  $(< 10\mu \mathrm{m})$  have been observed in the lower part of E horizons and in vertical tongues of E horizon material (Buurman et al., 2008).

Enrichment in quartz of the eluvian horizon also occurs via congruent destruction of clay minerals by hydrolysis (Bravard & Righi, 1989; Horbe et al., 2004). This enrichment

has been evaluated by calculation of quartz/feldspar ratios with depth (Salem Avad et al., 1982). Eluviation of clay, alone or in combination with organo-metallic complexes, have been documented, although this process may precede podzolisation (Guillet et al., 1975; Li et al., 1998).

Eluvial horizons from sandy soils typically have a basic microstructure, with a coarse monic c/f-related distribution pattern (Fig. 9). However, patterns can range to gefuric and possibly chitonic (e.g., Dubroeucq & Volkoff, 1998; Phillips and FitzPatrick, 1999), and the microstructure can also be porphyric (e.g., De Coninck & McKeague, 1985; Dubroeucq & Volkoff, 1998; Phillips & FitzPatrick, 1999). Sandy loam to loamy E horizons show more compact monic and gefuric c/f-related distribution patterns with closely packed bare grains and minor amounts of fine organic material (e.g., De Coninck & McKeague, 1985). Porphyric c/f-related distribution patterns (Fig. 10) have been reported for clay-rich E horizons of Podzols in Taiwan (Li et al., 1998; Hseu et al., 1999, 2004).

The coarse material of eluvial horizons is composed of uncoated grains, with a silt to coarse sand size, depending on the texture of the horizon. Phytoliths can be abundant in E horizons (Taina et al., 1997). Organic material and plant remains in various stages of decomposition are found in limited amounts (Salem Avad et al., 1982; De Coninck & McKeague, 1985; Li et al., 1998; Hseu et al., 2004).

Micromass material is generally present in limited amounts or absent. A weakly micaceous crystallitic b-fabric in an albic E horizon due to presence of sericite has been described (Van Ranst et al., 1997). Some small aggregates rich in organic matter (polymorphic material) might still be present (Kristiansen et al., 2010).

SEM examination of sand-sized grains (Dahlgren & Ugolini, 1991; Farmer et al., 1985; Skiba, 2007) illustrates the absence of organic surface coatings and the intense

etching of mineral grains such as plagioclase and biotite. An increase in mineral weathering in eluvial horizons has been documented for Podzols from northern Europe (Melkerud et al., 2000) and northwest Russia (Salem Avad et al., 1982). Platy minerals (such as muscovite, biotite or their weathering products) have been observed in thin sections to be strongly cracked parallel or perpendicular to the basal planes of the mineral (Skiba, 2007). Jongmans et al. (1997) and van Breemen et al. (2000) report the presence of tubular micropores  $(3 - 10\mu \mathrm{m})$  in feldspar and hornblende grains of albic materials, thought to be created by organic acids exuded by fungal hyphal tips. The observation by Phillips and FitzPatrick (1999) of fungi within biotite grains in E horizons is further evidence of biological weathering in these horizons. They also observed sclerotia within fractures in quartz grains. Quartz grains in albic horizons also often appear corroded (Dubroeucq & Volkoff, 1998; Schaefer et al., 2002; Horbe et al., 2004). Deep and abundant dissolution pits and cracks have been observed in quartz sand grains from tropical Podzols (Righi et al., 1990; Marcelino & Stoops, 1996). Quartz weathering induces grain fragmentation and results in abundant fine sand- and silt-sized quartz grains, in areas where the water table is close to the surface (Bravard & Righi, 1990; Dubroeucq & Volkoff, 1998).

# 3.3 Placic Horizons

Placitic horizons generally have porphyric c/f-related distribution patterns with coarse mineral grains embedded in a micromass in which colour depends on the relative amount of Fe and Mn oxides and organic matter (Fig. 11) (De Coninck & McKeague, 1985; Hseu et al., 1999). It may be reddish brown and cracked, consisting of complex organo-mineral

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/1f470503-4713-459a-b94a-6289d3cace8d/924346baebe9b4f20782d98972a9eb25e5ad3593ae5615c898f0b234393b985b.jpg)

material associated principally with iron; pale to reddish brown with little cracking, composed of Fe oxides (De Coninck & Righi, 1983); or black, principally composed of Mn oxides (Brewer et al., 1973). The composition of this material has been investigated by microanalysis, including element mapping (Brewer et al., 1973; Righi et al., 1982; Breuning-Madsen et al., 2000; Jien et al., 2010). SEM and differential XRD analysis have shown that the fine material is composed of a variety of Fe or Fe/Mn oxides (e.g., poorly crystalline goethite, ferrihydrite, lepidocrocite) (Eswaran, 1971; Guillet et al., 1976; Campbell & Schwertmann, 1984). The lepidocrocite likely results from saturated, reducing conditions created during pan formation, and goethite remains poorly crystalline as a result of the carbon-rich environment (Campbell & Schwertmann, 1984; Clayden et al., 1990). Lepidocrocite is well preserved in periodically waterlogged Podzols and in placic horizons (Campbell & Schwertmann, 1984) because its stability is strongly enhanced by the presence of complexing organic molecules and dissolved Al (Schwertmann & Taylor, 1989; Chiang et al., 1999). Microscopic examination and electron microprobe analysis have show that Fe and Mn concentrations occur as separate zones or layers and that Mn concentration increases relative to Fe content with increasing depth (Brewer et al., 1973; D'Amico et al., 2015). SEM examination by Eswaran (1971) revealed the presence of fine, discontinuous voids not visible under the petrographic microscope.

Placic horizons, superimposed on horizons with spodic-like characteristics, were observed in soils derived from volcanic materials (Pinheiro et al., 2004). The placic horizons were described as generally having chitonic c/f-related distribution patterns that grade to close-porphytic. These horizons can have a lamellar microstructure at the

top, composed of a layer of yellow to red or dark red globular material (Fe oxide) with an undifferentiated b-fabric, superimposed on a dark brown layer (organo-metallic complexes) with undifferentiated b-fabric.

The placic horizon is found in a wide range of climatic conditions (temperate to tropical) and landscapes, but always under udic or perudic moisture regimes (McKeague et al., 1983; Hseu et al., 1999; Pinheiro et al., 2004; Schawe et al., 2007; Wu & Chen, 2005; Jien et al., 2010). The formation process of these horizons is different from podzolisation (Clayden et al., 1990; Conry et al., 1996). Iron is reduced and mobilised in association with wet, acid soil conditions with high organic matter concentrations (Clayden et al., 1990; Lapen & Wang, 1999; Wu & Chen, 2005). Placic horizons form on the crystallisation of Fe/Mn oxides from dissolved divalent ions, triggered by changes in redox potential (Bockheim, 2011); thus periodical waterlogging is essential. These horizons are common in soils with spodic features that contain sufficient iron (De Coninck, et al., 1974; Phillips & FitzPatrick, 1999). The zone of saturation/reduction may represent a temporary condition within a seasonally water-saturated surface horizon with high organic matter content, or it may develop in organic and mineral horizons overlying a slowly permeable subsoil such as created by the placic layer (Righi et al., 1982; Hseu et al., 1999; Pinheiro et al., 2004). Placic deposition is generally at discontinuities where soil textural or structural changes affect permeability and hydraulic conductivity (Pinheiro et al., 2004). Therefore these horizons may be present in different positions within a soil profile (Conry et al., 1996). Hseu et al. (1999) found that best developed placic horizons occur in flat landscapes. In steeper landforms, placic horizons were bifurcated and thicker, suggesting lateral translocation. Well-developed placic horizons between E horizons and underlying ortstein have been reported for Podzols in the Italian Alps (D'Amico et al., 2015).

# 3.4 Other Horizons

Fragipans and duric horizons can form under spodic horizons (McKeague & Sprout, 1975; De Coninck & McKeague, 1985). Both fragipans (Weisenborn & Schaetzl, 2005) and duric horizons (McKeague & Sprout, 1975; McKeague & Protz, 1980) are generally characterised by a close porphyric c/f-related distribution pattern. Micromorphological examination shows few voids and coarse grains bridged or coated by thin, grey or brown silt. McKeague and Protz (1980) reported clay coatings on voids and coarse grains that vary from dark reddish brown to yellowish brown, which appear to cement the grains. Electron microprobe analysis indicates that the cement is composed of organo-Al or organo-Al/Fe compounds.

# 4. Conclusions

Fine organic and inorganic constituents composing spodic materials accumulate as a result of eluviation/illuviation processes and in situ transformations. Translocation of

constituents is generally regarded to occur by organo-complexation of metals, but translocation of inorganic compounds is known to occur as well. These processes, in part governed by the properties of the soil in which they form, result in a variety of materials and distribution patterns in thin sections.

One of the earliest applications of microscopic examination of undisturbed soil materials was for elucidation of the nature of spodic processes. This technique is important to determine the relative development of spodic horizons, especially the type, amount and distribution of amorphous fine organic materials, the degree of cementation and the sequence of the soil-forming processes. Development of spodic features has a complexity that makes searching for changes in genesis over time feasible. In addition, small changes in volume during pedogenesis, common in these soils, increase the length of time that features remain recognizable, adding to the identifiable genetic complexity. The different types of spodic materials vary considerably over short distances, both vertically and laterally.

Information on the nature of components derived from the micromorphological study of spodic materials is increased when optical microscopy is used in conjunction with other analytical techniques such as selective dissolution, electron microscopy with microanalysis, XRD and infrared analysis. Micromorphology in combination with other analytical tools will continue to be important in future research on spodic features. Buurman and Jongmans (2005) illustrated that spodic processes differ by climate and soil hydrology, but further research is needed to increase the understanding of site-specific spodic features, especially under different weathering regimes and hydromorphic conditions. One issue is the identification of soil conditions that determine the formation and stability of the different types of amorphous fine organic materials. Also, a better understanding of the role of specific soil organisms in the transformation of organic forms is needed (Phillips & FitzPatrick, 1999).

Landscape studies focused on soil hydrologic conditions influencing vertical as well as lateral translocation of spodic materials will provide a more complete understanding of the processes involved. These studies should include the compounding influence of water saturation related to fluctuating or perched water tables on ortstein and placic horizon chemistry. Chemical and physical association of organic and inorganic forms involved in monomorphic materials and in the nature of cementation of ortstein, placic and associated horizons is still not completely resolved. Also, further study of the development of albic horizons via humic acid eluviation and/or degradation is warranted. Questions still remain regarding the process of clay mineral loss from eluvial horizons during podzolisation in terms of congruent or incongruent dissolution, subsequent mineral formation or translocation of clay minerals. The complexity of these questions is further enhanced by the presence of pedogenic features developed during earlier stages with different climatic conditions on which the modern soil is imprinted.

# 1. Introduction

The oxic horizon (Soil Taxonomy; Soil Survey Staff, 2014) is a strongly weathered subsurface horizon with a clay fraction dominated by low-activity clays and iron and aluminium oxides, and with silt and sand fractions mainly composed of quartz and

including little or no weatherable minerals. The oxic horizon essentially corresponds to the ferralic horizon of the World Reference Base for soil resources (WRB Classification; IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015). Oxic and ferralic horizons are diagnostic horizons of Oxisols and Ferralsols, respectively. Throughout this manuscript, only Soil Taxonomy terminology will be used.

Oxisols were generally named red soils, red loams, red earths, ferralitic soils, lateritic soils and latosols in early publications. The name Latosol (Brazilian Soil Classification System; Embrapa, 1999) is still often used in publications (e.g., Schaefer et al., 2004; Reatto et al., 2009).

These soils are widespread in humid tropical and subtropical regions, where they are mostly found on old, stable land surfaces or in sediments derived from them; they can also form on easily weatherable materials such as ultrabasic magmatic rocks (e.g., Van Wambeke et al., 1983). They are occasionally found in present-day aridic soil moisture regimes (e.g., north-eastern Brazil), where they developed in sedimentary deposits or saprolites, previously weathered under more humid conditions (Beinroth et al., 1996). Even in tropical and subtropical regions, the characteristics of oxic materials are not necessarily the result of current pedological processes and climates, but may be inherited from parent materials derived directly or indirectly from deeply weathered saprolites (Stoops, 1989; Stoops et al., 1994; Buol et al., 2003).

The micromorphology of oxic materials was first briefly studied by Kubiëna (1948). The earliest more detailed studies, on soils from D.R. Congo, were done by De Craene and Laruelle (1955, 1956a, 1956b), Laruelle (1956) and De Craene (1967). Other important early contributions were published by pedologists of Ghent University on strongly weathered soils from Central Africa, Central and South America and Southeast Asia (e.g., Stoops, 1964, 1968; Eswaran, 1972, 1979; Eswaran & Sys, 1976), by French pedologists on soils from Central and West Africa (e.g., Beaudou, 1972; Chauvel, 1972; Beaudou et al., 1977; Muller, 1977a, 1977b; Chauvel et al., 1978), and by French and Brazilian soil scientists on soils from Brazil (Bennema et al., 1970; Lepsch & Buol, 1974; Pédro et al., 1976; Chauvel et al., 1983). General reviews of the micromorphological characteristics of Oxisols have been published in the past by Buol and Eswaran (1978, 1999), Eswaran (1979), Stoops (1983) and Stoops and Buol (1985).

This review concerns the interpretation of the micromorphological characteristics of oxic materials in a broad sense. It covers not only oxic horizons but also related materials, such as horizons with clay content increase but with physical, chemical and mineralogical characteristics similar to those of oxic horizons (e.g., kandic horizons of certain Ultisols), and to horizons that do not fit the definition of oxic because of their very low clay content (e.g., ochric horizons of certain Entisols).

The main problems encountered when reviewing the existing literature are the imprecise definition of the materials under study, often classified using regional soil classification systems, and the lack of a clear and uniform terminology in the description of micromorphological features.

# 2.1 General Features

A well-developed granular microstructure is typical for oxic materials (Figs. 1A and B, and 2A and B). The granular aggregates can be well separated or partly to completely welded, the latter giving rise to more massive microstructures (Fig. 3A). Their diameter varies between 10 and  $1000\mu \mathrm{m}$ , with various size ranges reported by different authors, e.g.,  $50 - 400\mu \mathrm{m}$  (Benayas & Pinto Ricardo, 1973),  $30 - 500\mu \mathrm{m}$  (Chauvel, 1977),  $100 - 500\mu \mathrm{m}$  (Chauvel & Pedro, 1978),  $50 - 1000\mu \mathrm{m}$  (Eschenbrenner, 1986),  $10 - 100\mu \mathrm{m}$  (Santos et al., 1989),  $30 - 40\mu \mathrm{m}$  (Tandy et al., 1990),  $100 - 1000\mu \mathrm{m}$  (Schaefer, 2001; Cooper et al., 2005) and  $50 - 200\mu \mathrm{m}$  (Reatto et al., 2009).

The granular aggregates are responsible for the friable consistency of these soils in the field. They correspond to the so-called pseudosils and pseudosands (Ahn, 1970), as

documented by the micromorphological study of these fractions after different dispersion treatments (Pédro et al., 1976; Guedez & Langohr, 1978; Embrechts & Stoops, 1987).

SEM studies of Oxisols from Hawaii (Tsuji et al., 1975) and TEM examination of Oxisol samples from Brazil (Bui et al., 1989; Santos et al., 1989; Bartoli et al., 1992), French Guiana (Tandy et al., 1990) and Thailand (Tawornpruek et al., 2005) revealed the presence of submicroscopic intra-aggregate pores. Different sizes were reported for the diameter of these pores: average of  $40\mathrm{nm}$  (Santos et al., 1989; Bui et al., 1989), smaller than  $100\mathrm{nm}$  (Tandy et al., 1990),  $7 - 40\mathrm{nm}$  (Bartoli et al., 1992),  $10 - 50\mathrm{nm}$  (Tawornpruek et al., 2005). Early TEM studies by Cambier and Prost (1981) reported the existence of several levels of organisation in a granular aggregate: (i) kaolinite crystallites  $(100\mathrm{nm})$  formed by regular stacking of several layers; (ii) particles originated by face-to-face juxtaposition of kaolinite crystallites; (iii) domains composed by particles with same orientation and bound by iron compounds; and (iv) microaggregates composed of non-oriented domains. Soil aggregate hierarchy of a Brazilian Oxisol was also studied by Vrdoljak and Sposito (2002), who observed that organic components were an important

factor at all levels of the structural organisation. Other ultramicroscopic studies of Oxisol aggregates from Brazil and Thailand showed that the clay-size mineral particles consist of platy kaolinite crystals and almost equant iron oxide crystals (Hart et al., 2003) or gibbsite crystals (Bartoli et al., 1992), arranged in an open 'card house' manner (Tawornpruek et al., 2005). Humified hyphae and decomposed organic matter have been observed within the aggregates (Santos et al., 1989; Vrdoljak & Sposito, 2002), suggesting that fungal activity could play a relevant role in the formation of the aggregates.

The granular microstructure and the internal structure of the granular aggregates strongly affect the water retention behaviour of the soil (Sharma & Uehara, 1968, Tsuji et al., 1975; Uehara & Keng, 1975; Muller, 1983; Taworpruek et al., 2005), and they are thus important for soil management. They also have an effect on the results of soil analysis, for instance by the release of cations when soil samples are crushed (Moura Filho & Buol, 1976).

Sandy oxic materials have a basic microstructure with close enaulic and locally chitonic c/f-related distribution patterns, the granular aggregates being similar to those observed for clayey oxic materials (Fig. 4A and B).

In addition to intergranular porosity, channels are common and usually partially or completely filled with excrements or groundmass material (see Section 4.1).

# 2.2 Origin of Granular Aggregates

Granular aggregates have since long been recognised in thin sections of oxic materials (e.g., De Craene & Laruelle, 1955; Fölster, 1964; Condado, 1969; Bennema et al., 1970; Lepsch & Buol, 1974). Although various attempts have been made to explain their origin, no consensus has been reached between the different authors.

Some authors (e.g., Muller, 1977a, 1983; Bitom & Volkoff, 1991) suggest an essentially physical origin and explain the formation of granular aggregates by mechanical fracturing of a compact soil material, due to alternating wetting and drying. The originally

speckled b-fabric of the compact soil would first evolve to a reticulate b-fabric, the streaks gradually becoming discoloured and acquiring a progressively better visibility of the interference colours of the micromass. Next, small fissures develop within these streaks, eventually leading to formation of individual small peds, which become more and more rounded. However, features related to these processes are not recognised for most soils studied by the present authors. The inferred mechanisms also do not apply to sandy oxic materials, which have clearly similar granular aggregates associated with enaulic c/f-related distribution patterns (Schaefer et al., 2004; Marcelino, unpublished data). Besides aggregates formed by fracturing, Muller (1977a) distinguished other less abundant genetic types of granular aggregates: zoogenetic, ferritic, relict and complex. The first three are in fact pedofeatures (see Section 4), namely excrements and inherited nodules.

According to other authors, physico-chemical interactions between kaolinite and iron oxides, in conditions with extreme leaching rates, can be at the origin of granular aggregate occurrences (e.g., Beaudou, 1972; Pedro et al., 1976; Chauvel, 1977; Chauvel et al., 1978; Chauvel & Pedro, 1978; Buol & Eswaran, 1978; Eswaran & Daud, 1980; Chauvel et al., 1983; Pedro, 1987; Santos et al., 1989; Bitom & Volkoff, 1991). A secondary role can be played by soil mesofauna, which could contribute to the separation of the pre-formed granular aggregates (Chauvel, 1972, 1977; Chauvel et al., 1976; Muller, 1977a; Stoops, 1983). Multiple processes, including faunal activity, were also invoked by Vidal-Torrado et al. (1999) for the formation of microaggregates in an Oxisol from Brazil.

Many studies attribute the granular microstructure mainly to biological activity (e.g., Benayas & Pinto Ricardo, 1973; Verheye & Stoops, 1975), more specifically long-term termite activity (Eschenbrenner, 1986; Trapnell & Webster, 1986; Stoops, 1991; Jungerius et al., 1999; Nunes et al., 2000; Schaefer, 2001; Reatto et al., 2009; Sarcinelli et al., 2009). Micromorphological evidence in favour of a role of termites includes the observation that granular peds in oxic materials are similar in size, shape and internal structure to pellets made by termites to build nests and mounds, both in nature and in laboratory experiments (Eschenbrenner, 1986; Jungerius et al., 1999; Cosarinsky et al., 2005). The presence of charcoal and well-sorted small quartz grains  $(< 100\mu \mathrm{m})$  within the granular aggregates, whereas larger quartz grains are observed in non-granular parts, further supports this hypothesis (Schaefer, 2001). Impregnation of soil material with saliva makes the granular aggregates very stable, much more stable than faecal pellets, which are only found as infillings (Jungerius et al., 1999). It has also been observed that Oxisols in regions with less intense termite activity (e.g., in East Sumatra) have a less developed granular microstructure than Oxisols with high termite activity (e.g., in Brazil) (Buurman, pers. comm.).

An experimental study on the effects of wetting and drying cycles has shown that physical, chemical and mineralogical factors alone could not explain the genesis of granular aggregates (Viana et al., 2004). Also, three different morphological types have been recognised for Oxisols from Brazil, each of them related to one or more genetic processes (Cooper et al., 2005): (i) oval granular aggregates with well-sorted quartz

grains, produced by termites or ants; (ii) oval granular aggregates without well-sorted quartz grains, with either a biological or a geochemical origin; and (iii) polyhedral aggregates, formed by cracking of soil material due to alternating wet and dry conditions.

# 2.3 Degree of Development and Degradation of the Granular Microstructure

The formation of a granular structure in oxic materials does not seem to depend on the underlying lithology, but its degree of development and its stability seems to be related to both the composition of the parent material and climatic conditions, mostly because these factors determine the type and amount of aluminium and iron oxides present. Some authors observed that the granular microstructure was more developed in Ustic soil moisture regimes than in Udic soil moisture regimes (Buol & Eswaran, 1978; Utami et al., 1997; Tawornpruek et al., 2005; Simas et al., 2005). Well-drained red soils have also been reported to have better developed granular microstructure than less well-drained yellow soils (Beaudou et al., 1987; Muggler & Buurman, 1997; Skorupa et al., 2016), the colour being determined by the type of iron oxides present, in particular the relative proportion of hematite and goethite (Camacho et al., 1990). High gibbsite and iron oxide contents of the soil or the parent material have been associated with better developed and more stable granular microstructures (Cardoso de Lima & Eswaran, 1987; Dick & Schwertmann, 1996; Baert & Van Ranst, 1997a; Ferreira et al., 1999; Schaefer, 2001; Schaefer et al., 2002, 2004). However, Reatto et al. (2009) compared Oxisols with different mineralogical compositions and observed that this factor has no effect on microstructure development.

The age of the soil may play a role in the degree of development of the granular structure. For instance, Lepsch and Buol (1974), studying an Ultisol-Oxisol toposequence in Brazil, and West et al. (1997), studying a sequence of strongly weathered soils on volcanic deposits in the Philippines, observed that older soils had better developed granular microstructure in the oxic horizon than the younger soils. Degradation of a stable granular microstructure is usually linked to local changes in soil climate, which mainly resulted in the solubilisation and redistribution of iron and aluminium oxides and in increased clay dispersion and eluviation.

Collapse of the granular microstructure is one of the processes involved in present-day pedogenesis that leads to the formation of epipedons at the expense of the underlying oxic horizon, besides discolouration of the fine material, clay eluviation and accumulation of organic matter (Lepsch & Buol, 1974; Chauvel, 1977; Muller, 1977b, 1983; Muggler & Buurman, 1997). Similarly, changes in the relationship between clays and iron oxides, followed by changes of the c/f-related distribution patterns and the collapse of the granular microstructure, may explain the transformation of 'red soils' typical for humid climates into 'beige soils' in drier climates with alternating very dry

and very wet periods (Chauvel et al., 1976; Chauvel, 1977; Chauvel & Pedro, 1978). In the same way, redistribution of iron oxides may lead to loss of aggregate stability and collapse of the granular microstructure in poorly drained soils (Stoops, 1989).

Transformation of a typical granular microstructure in oxic (ferralic) horizons to a more massive subangular blocky microstructure in argillic or kandic (argic or nitic) horizons has been often reported (e.g., Lepsch & Buol, 1974, Fedoroff & Eswaran, 1985; Vidal-Torrado et al., 1999; Hallaire et al., 1994; Cooper et al., 2010; Padmanabhan et al., 2012) and attributed to several processes, including wetting and drying, biological activity and clay illuviation. The model proposed by Cooper et al. (2010), for Brazilian soils with alternating wetting and drying cycles, in a region with a pronounced dry season, assumes that coalescence of granular aggregates occurred during a dry period in the past, followed by development of a blocky microstructure through fissuration of the coalesced material when the climate became more humid.

Aggregates in surface horizons of Oxisols in slope positions along an Oxisol-Spodosol toposequence had irregular and rough surfaces and UV-fluorescent hypocoatings, indicative of clay alteration to amorphous compounds, and they were more porous than those of Oxisols in plateau positions (Bravard & Righi, 1990). These observations suggest that the granular structure of surface horizons of Oxisols in slope positions is unstable in present-day conditions.

Compaction and degradation of the granular microstructure of Oxisols as a consequence of cultivation and land use changes has often been documented (Chauvel et al., 1991; Stoner et al., 1991; Curmi et al., 1994; Hartmann et al., 1994; Barros et al., 2001; Balbino et al., 2002, Silva et al., 2015). In cultivated soils, the main processes involved in the formation of a massive groundmass are the destruction of large aggregates and mechanical welding of small aggregates into larger, blocky clods (Fig. 5). Moreover, micromorphological evidence of pore clogging by fine-grained material produced by tillage has been reported (Stoner et al., 1991). Land use changes also affect soil structure by inducing changes in soil macrofauna composition (see Kooistra & Pulleman, 2018).

# 3. Groundmass

The groundmass of oxic materials is characterised by a marked homogeneity, which results from continuous bioturbation (Flach et al., 1968; Stoops, 1983, 1991; see also Stoops & Schaefer, 2018).

# 3.1 c/f-Related Distribution Patterns

The limit between coarse and fine material is generally set at  $5\mu \mathrm{m}$ , to consider the numerous small opaque grains as part of the fine material. The c/f-related distribution pattern is generally open to close porphyric. In surface horizons and in sandy materials, it becomes enaolic (Fig. 4).

# 3.2 Coarse Mineral Material

# 3.2.1 General Features

The coarse fraction predominantly consists of sand-sized quartz grains, with other resistant minerals, such as zircon, tourmaline and rutile, as the most common accessory components. Opaque minerals, such as ilmenite and magnetite, are common in soils formed on basic rocks (Buol & Eswaran, 1978; Rodriguez-Rodriguez et al., 1980; Tejedor Salguero et al., 1984/85). In soils on metamorphic rocks, sillimanite and kyanite may also be present (Stoops & Buol, 1985). Weatherable minerals are occasionally present when covered by iron oxide or gibbsite coatings (Stoops, 1968; Verheye & Stoops, 1975; Buol & Eswaran, 1978) and thus not available for interactions with soil solutions (Baert & Van Ranst, 1997b). Stable iron and aluminium oxide pseudomorphs are sometimes recognised, especially near the saprolite (see Zauyah et al., 2018). Examples include goethite pseudomorphs after garnet (Embrechts & Stoops, 1982), gibbsite after feldspar (Eswaran & Wong Chaw Bin, 1978), and various minerals after olivine, augite and biotite (Eswaran

et al., 1979; Eswaran, 1990). Inherited iron oxide nodules (see Section 4.2) are also part of the coarse material.

In most oxic materials, the silt fraction is poorly represented, except for the abundant opaque grains. The silt is mostly composed of quartz, and it sometimes includes gibbsite (Eswaran et al., 1977), phytoliths and inherited iron oxide nodules (Stoops, 1983). The relative amount of silt-sized quartz grains has been reported to increase with increasing depth, which was explained by dissolution of small grains in the upper part of the profile (Chauvel, 1977). Fragmentation of sand-sized quartz grains during sample preparation is responsible for most of the silt fraction obtained in textural analyses. Quartz grains in oxic materials are generally brittle, and it is commonly observed in thin sections (more than for other materials) that the grains are strongly fractured and pieces are lost during polishing (see Fig. 6) (Stoops & Buol, 1985). Others authors found indications that partial dissolution of quartz is the most important process of silt formation in deep saprolites (Muggler et al., 1997).

In surface horizons, the coarse material is generally more abundant than in the oxic horizon. The presence of surface horizons with a coarser texture has often been reported for tropical soils and has been attributed to one or more of the following processes acting simultaneously or sequentially on surface and subsurface horizons: selective removal of clay from the surface, earthworm and termite activity, clay destruction in the epipedon, and clay eluviation/illuviation (e.g., Nye, 1955; Roose, 1970; Moorman, 1979; Buurman & Sukardi, 1980; Andrade et al., 1997).

# 3.2.2 Weathering of Quartz

Fissuring of quartz grains (see Fig. 4C) was already observed in some early studies (Beaudou, 1972; Claisse, 1972). The fissures are often filled with Fe and Al oxides (Stoops, 1968; Claisse, 1972), which is a feature described as 'runiquartz' (Eswaran et al., 1975) (Fig. 6). According to the latter study, runiquartz is formed by infusion of amorphous iron- or aluminium-rich fine material into the cracks of quartz grains, which is then transformed to goethite, hematite or gibbsite. In some soils the same material may form coatings around the runiquartz grains (Eswaran et al., 1975, Padmanabhan & Mermut, 1996). Runiquartz is very common in laterites (see Stoops & Marcelino, 2018) and in most Oxisols, in which the material filling the cracks is usually different from the enclosing fine material. The latter has been interpreted as an indication that runiquartz grains are inherited, probably from a former lateritic material (Stoops, 1989; Muggler & Buurman, 1997). Runiquartz is very stable and persists even in soils subjected to strong weathering conditions, such as soils along slopes and poorly drained soils (Eswaran, 1979; Stoops, 1989). However, the infusion of fine material may also lead to physical breakdown of the quartz grains (see Fig. 6) (Eswaran & Stoops, 1979).

Thin sections show various signs of dissolution of quartz grains, such as corroded surfaces (Beaudou, 1972) and 'floating' grains in voids with a slightly larger size (Eswaran & Stoops, 1979; Muller et al., 1980/81; Muggler et al., 2007). In SEM images, marks of intense chemical weathering along the surface of quartz grains, such as shallow triangular features, deep pyramidal pits and other dissolution features (Fig. 7), are unequivocally recognised and have often been described and studied (e.g., Leneuf, 1973; Eswaran et al., 1979; Eswaran & Stoops, 1979; Flageollet, 1980/81; Fritsch, 1988). Although etch pits in

FIGURE 7 SEM image of a highly weathered quartz grain in sandy oxic material (Entisol, D.R. Congo), illustrating different types of dissolution figures such as the deep pyramidal etch pits on one crystal face (left) and the triangular plates with tile-like arrangement on another face (right).

the surfaces of quartz grains from oxic materials are often inherited from previous environments, their frequency and size reflect present-day soil-moisture relationships and can be used to assess the relative degree of weathering of tropical soils developed on the same parent material (Marcelino & Stoops, 1996; Marcelino et al., 1999).

# 3.3 Fine Mineral Material

The micromass in well-drained soils is characteristically very homogeneous. The colour is related to the amount, type and degree of crystallisation of the iron oxides present, which in turn depend on the parent material, degree of alteration, climate and internal drainage (Stoops, 1968; Bennema et al., 1970). When yellowish, the micromass can be limpid or speckled, and when reddish, it is generally speckled and frequently cloudy (Bennema et al., 1970). The cloudiness of the fine material has been related to incipient flocculation of iron oxides. However, a micromass free of iron oxides, as in mottled clays, has also been described as cloudy, whereby cloudiness is attributed to the presence of very fine-grained gibbsite (e.g., Dedecker & Stoops, 1993). Silt-sized red speckles, probably hematite aggregates, are often observed. They are inherited from plinthitized saprolitic material (see Zauyah et al., 2018) and incorporated into the soil by bioturbation (Stoops, 1968; Schmidt-Lorenz, 1980; Stoops, 1989; Muggler & Buurman, 1997; Muggler et al., 1999). Very small gibbsite or goethite crystals may also be present.

The b-fabric in oxic materials is weakly expressed, most commonly undifferentiated (Figs. 1C and 4C) or weakly stipple-speckled. This is attributed to the high concentration and masking effect of iron oxides (e.g., Eswaran & Daud, 1980), the low birefringence of kaolinite (Stoops, 1983) and the random arrangement of clay particles (Stoops, 1968; Eswaran, 1972; Stoops & Buol, 1985).

Weakly striated b-fabrics are sometimes observed, if a strong light source is used and the section is sufficiently thin. The b-fabric is porostriated in the case of individual granular aggregates and circular striated in the case of welded granular aggregates (Fig. 2C). They are the result of clay particles being parallel orientated along the border of the aggregates (Buol & Eswaran, 1978; Santos et al., 1989). This, as mentioned above, could be due to pressures exerted by termites on the surface of pellets during regurgitation and when plastering channel walls (Eschenbrenner, 1986). Buol and Eswaran (1978) suggest that this specific orientation of the clay is attained during transport. The feature has also been related to the presence of easily dispersible clay around the granular aggregates (Embrechts & Stoops, 1986, 1987).

The undifferentiated b-fabric of soils developed on volcanic material becomes generally stipple-speckled to weakly striated in a first stage and finally, in the Oxisol, changes again to undifferentiated, with cloudy limpidity, typical for oxic materials (Rodriguez Rodriguez et al., 1988; West et al., 1997; see also Stoops et al., 2018).

Tubular features (50-100  $\mu$ m) with crescent striated b-fabrics (Fig. 3B and C), not visible in plain light (Fig. 3A), have been reported for oxic materials from Central Africa (Stoops, 1968; Beaudou et al., 1977), Brazil (Stoops, 1991; Muggler & Buurman, 2000;

Schaefer et al., 2004) and Southeast Asia (Stoops & Buol, 1985). They are passage features, recording intense biological activity.

A clear relationship seems to exist between the degree of development of the b-fabric and other characteristics of Oxisols. Early studies related weakly developed b-fabrics to strong aggregate stability (Cagauan & Uehara, 1965). Speckled b-fabrics are common in yellow oxic materials with poorly developed granular microstructures, but they are rare or absent in materials with better developed granular microstructures (Beaudou et al., 1977). Well-developed b-fabrics have also been related to high concentrations of easily dispersible clays (Embrechts & Stoops, 1986, 1987), and weakly developed b-fabrics in clay-rich Oxisols have been related to low plasticity (Zainol & Stoops, 1986).

# 3.4 Organic Material

Root residues and other organ residues in different states of decomposition are frequent in surface horizons. Charcoal fragments, probably originated from bush fires, are sometimes observed in thin sections (unpublished observation by the authors).

# 4. Pedofeatures

Pedofeatures, except those related to faunal activity, are very restricted, because of the physico-chemical stability of the material and continuous bioturbation. Many of them are relict features formed in previous environments and thus no longer reflect present-day pedogenesis.

# 4.1 Channel Infillings and Coatings

Clay coatings that are not laminated and commonly have an admixture of very fine sand and silt are sometimes observed in channels, which may be filled with granular aggregates and more or less sorted quartz grains (Fig. 8A and B). In very clayey materials, these coatings or fragments of coatings are difficult to distinguish from the groundmass, but in sandy materials they are very clear (Fig. 8B) (Marcelino, unpublished data). These textural coatings are plasters that are applied to the walls of channels by termites (e.g., Kooistra, 1982; Kauffman, 1987; Miedema et al., 1994; see also Kooistra & Pulleman, 2018).

Channels and chambers often contain loose continuous or discontinuous infillings composed of groundmass material (Fig. 8A and B) or excrements (e.g., Chauvel, 1977, Stoops, 1983, Kauffman, 1987). Dense complete channel infillings with bow-like (crescent striated) internal fabric have also been observed for oxic materials, as well as in present-day termite mounds, and interpreted as passage features (e.g., Stoops, 1964, 1968; Lee & Wood, 1971; Sleeman & Brewer, 1972; Mermut et al., 1984).

# 4.2 Iron Oxide Pedofeatures

More or less rounded iron oxide nodules with sharp boundaries and various types of internal fabric, sometimes containing other pedofeatures such as iron oxide coatings and

fragments of clay coatings, are common (Fig. 9). These nodules are inherited laterite nodules (e.g., Stoops, 1968, 1983; Buol & Eswaran, 1978; Faure, 1987; see also Stoops & Marcelino, 2018), unrelated to present-day pedogenesis and thus to be considered as part of the coarse material.

Newly formed impregnative, irregular and rather diffuse iron oxide nodules, coatings and hypocoatings, as well as spherulitic goethite coatings (e.g., Frei, 1964; Eswaran, 1972; Stoops, 1983), occur in moderately to poorly drained oxic materials (see Vepraskas et al., 2018).

Skorupa et al. (2016) report the presence of relict iron oxide nodules with signs of dissolution, due to the more humid current environment, in Oxisols formed on the same parent material but with different internal drainage intensity. However, newly formed impregnative nodules were only present in the Oxisol with slower internal drainage.

# 4.3 Gibbsite Coatings and Nodules

Gibbsite may be present as a pedogenic mineral in Oxisols. Its formation in highly weathered soils has been attributed to direct precipitation from soil solutions, in the form of gibbsite coatings along the sides of voids and grains and as coarse-grained gibbsite nodules (Eswaran et al. 1977, 1979; Stoops & Delvigne, 1990; Zeese et al., 1994; Muggler et al., 2007). The coatings generally consist of silt-sized crystals oriented perpendicularly to the surface. Gibbsite pedofeatures are more frequent in oxic materials developed on acid rocks than on basic or ultrabasic rocks (Buol & Eswaran, 1978) and seem to be rather unstable (Stoops & Buol, 1985).

Small gibbsite crystals (fine silt to clay) that formed by replacement of kaolinite have commonly been described in thin sections of saprolites (see Zauyah et al., 2018) and C horizons of Oxisols. They occur as disseminated crystals or as nodules and have been related to microenvironments with in situ desilicification (Stoops & Delvigne, 1990; Stoops et al., 1990; Dedecker & Stoops, 1993; Zeese et al., 1994; Muggler et al., 2007).

Both coarse- and fine-grained inherited gibbsite nodules (e.g., bauxite nodules) can be found in Oxisols. Various gibbsite forms occurring in Oxisols and lateritic materials have been studied in detail by Eswaran et al. (1977).

# 4.4 Clay Coatings and Infillings

Illuviation of clay is not, in general, an active process in oxic horizons, and thus clay coatings are usually not present in large amounts. However, common clay coatings have been reported in early publications, for instance, for soils from Angola (Benayas & Pinto Ricardo, 1973; Benayas & Réfega, 1974), Brazil (Falci & Mendes, 1973) and Uganda (Pidgeon, 1976), and for poorly drained oxic materials from Central Africa (Beaudou, 1972; Beaudou & Chatelin, 1974). The horizons in which they occur would most probably

be classified not as oxic but as kandic (argic or nitic) and, depending on the depth of their occurrence and on variations in clay content within the profile, the soils are either Oxisols or Ultisols. Referring to strong similarities in micromorphological characteristics between oxic and kandic horizons, and in clay composition between textural pedofeatures and the groundmass, Padmanabhan et al. (2012) suggested that the presence of moved clay in kandic horizons, in contrast to argillic horizons, may not result in significant changes of soil properties. Clay coatings and fragments of clay coatings have been observed in small amounts for Oxisols transitional to Ultisols (Lepsch & Buol, 1974; Eswaran & Sys, 1976; Fedoroff & Eswaran, 1985), where the presence of clay coatings is generally attributed to soil formation on less weathered parent materials. Infillings with oriented clay in interaggregate spaces have been reported by Ibraimo et al. (2004) for polycyclic Oxisols from Brazil, suggesting that clay illuviation is associated with the present-day arid climate, whereas the granular microstructure developed during an earlier period with a more equable, wetter climate. Illuvial clay features may be present in deep horizons of Oxisols (Chauvel, 1977; Stoops & Buol, 1985; Nettleton et al., 1987; Eswaran, 1990) and seem to be less frequent in soils on basic volcanic rocks than in those on other rocks (Stoops & Buol, 1985). Thin clay coatings around quartz grains were often noticed in surface horizons and are attributed to clay translocation after first heavy rains (Stoops, 1968).

Clay coatings and infillings in oxic materials are usually composed of limpid yellowish red clay, generally without layering (Fig. 10A and B). They show low interference colours typical for kaolinite, which often is masked by iron oxides (Fig. 10C).

Fragments of clay coatings have been observed in small amounts (Stoops, 1968; Beaudou, 1972; Eswaran et al., 1979; Beaudou et al., 1987; Eswaran, 1990; Muggler & Buurman, 2000). They are mostly rounded or subrounded and sometimes occur inside iron oxide nodules, suggesting that they are transported relict features.

Optically isotropic clay coatings with anisotropic zones were described in Oxisols on volcanic ash from West Java (Buurman & Jongmans, 1987). They originate from precipitation of allophane from recent ash fall, which recrystallised to halloysite under the influence of desiccation.

# 4.5 Siliceous Pedofeatures

Although neoformation of siliceous features is difficult to explain for environments producing oxic materials, Eswaran (1972) mentions the presence, in Oxisols on basalt, of quartz nodules and coatings, crystallised from soil solutions saturated with silica derived from weathering of primary minerals. Also, triangular plates with tile-like arrangement and parallel elongated prismatic crystals with pyramidal terminations have been observed in SEM images of the surface of quartz grains and interpreted as quartz neoformations (e.g., Krinsley & Doornkamp, 1973; Eswaran & Stoops, 1979). Other authors explain similar surface textures as dissolution features, related to differences in dissolution rates between crystallographic orientations, hypothesis supported by the occurrence

# 5. Conclusions

Micromorphological techniques have been often used in the study of oxic and related materials. Wide attention has been given to the study of the granular microstructure that is typical for these materials, but no consensus has been reached on its origin. Submicroscopic techniques were mainly used to study mineral weathering, mainly of quartz, and the formation of kaolinite, iron oxides and gibbsite occurrences.

Besides its support to soil classification revisions and the study of palaeosols, the systematic use of micromorphological techniques in the study of well-defined oxic and related materials could help to further clarify various aspects, such as the role of soil animals in soil formation, and the preservation or degradation of features under changed environmental conditions.

# 1. Introduction

# 1.1 Historical Background

Laterites were first described by Buchanan (1807) in southern India. They have subsequently been the subject of numerous studies, which is partly related to their importance

in various disciplines. Examples include the fields of economic geology (e.g., source of elements such as aluminium, manganese and nickel, and use as building materials), agronomy (e.g., restriction of root development, scarcity of essential nutrients) and geomorphology (e.g., palaeoenvironmental change). Laterites and their residues cover about  $33\%$  of the continents (Tardy, 1993). Their formation is related primarily to a climate with high humidity and high mean annual temperature, a geomorphological environment with limited runoff and without aggressive erosion, and relative tectonic stability with minimal crustal deformation and only gradual regional uplift (Widdowson, 2007).

Although a large volume of literature is available on laterites and bauxites, micromorphological and petrographical studies are rather limited in number and often ambiguous. Up to now, no systematic review has been published on the nature and significance of the micromorphological features observed. The oldest thin section descriptions known to us are those by Lacroix (1913) and Harrison (1933), who studied laterites in Guinea and British Guiana. Important early studies by soil scientists include those by Humbert (1948) on lateritic weathering in New Guinea, Kubiena (1954) on laterites from Guinea, the less well-known work of De Craene and Laruelle (1955) on laterites and associated soils from Congo and the book by Alexander and Cady (1962), which reports detailed microscopic studies of various lateritic materials from Central Africa. Another relevant early contribution is the micromorphological study on the evolution of soft lateritic material by Schmidt-Lorenz (1964). Research by French scientists has also been important, as summarised in the works of Nahon (1991) and Tardy (1993). For bauxites, attempts to classify microfabrics have been made by Valeton (1972, 1973), Bardossy and Nicolas (1973), Mindsighty (1978, 1983), Bardossy (1982), Boulangé (1984) and Aleva (1987), partly concentrating on karst bauxites and using a largely sedimentological approach.

Early thin section studies by Lelong (1967) concluded that alterites or laterites cannot be fully characterised if not all fractions, from the clay fraction to the largest components, are taken into consideration. This implies that the routine procedures in soil science laboratories, discarding the fraction larger than  $2\mathrm{mm}$ , are not suitable for the study of lateritic materials.

This chapter deals with fabrics of lateritic materials recognised in thin sections for specific parts of the lateritic weathering mantle. Only weathering profiles and their erosion products, directly relevant for soil and regolith studies, are included in this review. Studies done in a context of mining, such as the exploitation of karst bauxites, are not considered. The preparation of this review was complicated by the lack of published detailed descriptions, and by the manifold and sometimes contradictory terms for field and microscopic characteristics, often influenced by the different genetic approaches of the various schools.

# 1.2 Definition of Laterite

Although lateritic and bauxitic materials have been widely studied, no generally accepted definition of laterite exists. Many definitions have been proposed since the first

description of laterites by Buchanan (1807). Excellent reviews of the old definitions are given by Sivarajasingham et al. (1962) and Maignien (1966). The different backgrounds of the authors formulating these definitions lead sometimes to conflicting situations. Also the continent where the author has been mostly active influences his ideas about the nature and genesis of lateritic materials. As a result, similar materials were often indicated by different names, or the same name was used for different features.

A commonly used definition is the one proposed by Schellmann (1982, 1983) for IGCP Project 124 on Laterisation Processes and later adopted by EUROLAT and CORLAT. This definition, however, does not explicitly consider the role of lateral transport, absolute enrichment or the common polygenetic nature of laterite profiles (e.g., Fölster et al., 1971; Bourman & Ollier, 2002). Some authors limit the use of the term 'laterite' to those formed by residual enrichment (Schmidt-Lorenz, 1974b; Aleva, 1986). Other authors use the term 'laterite soil' or 'lateritic soil' for red tropical soils (e.g., Varghese & Byju, 1993; Fritsch et al., 2002). Additional terms found in literature for irreversibly hardened iron or aluminium oxide accumulations include petroplinthite, introduced by Sys (1968) and ferricrete, commonly used by French authors (e.g., Tardy, 1993), the latter being a general term that is not restricted to materials derived from processes of lateritisation sensu strictum.

Laterites have been classified according to position in the landscape, morphology, chemistry and mineralogy. A ternary mineralogical diagram with an iron-axis (hematite, goethite), an aluminium-axis (gibbsite, boehmite, diaspore) and a clay-axis (mainly kaolinite) has been commonly used (Bárdossy & Aleva, 1990; Aleva, 1994). This diagram has ferrite, bauxite and kaolinite as end-members and ferruginous laterite, bauxitic laterite and kaolinitic bauxite as intermediate phases.

In this chapter, the term laterite is used in a broad sense, as in the definition by Charman (1988). It refers to a highly weathered natural material with high concentration of hydrated oxides of iron or aluminium (so-called sesquioxides), as a consequence of residual accumulation and/or absolute enrichment, by components transported in solution or as detrital material. The distinction between these processes is not always clear and both may be involved in the formation of a laterite. Since the aim of this chapter is not to discuss genesis and classification in detail, only two groups will be considered: the residual or in situ laterites and the detrital laterites, resulting from accumulation of eroded laterite fragments. The accumulated hydrated oxides may be present as the only constituent of an unhardened soil or a hardened layer. They can also be the main constituent of concretionary nodules in a soil matrix or of a cemented matrix enclosing other materials. Laterites are thus the product of secondary physico-chemical processes and not of the normal primary sedimentary, metamorphic or igneous processes and they can be considered as metasomatic rocks. One exception is the deposition of reworked lateritic material in valleys.

The proposed definition corresponds essentially to that of the plinthic and petroplinthic diagnostic horizons of the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015). In Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 2014), much of the

materials that have been called laterite are included in categories of soils with plinthite, which is a diagnostic soil characteristic that refers to the iron-rich and humus-poor parts of a layer or horizon, which irreversibly harden to ironstone on exposure to repeated wetting and drying. The absence or low concentration of organic matter in ironstone differentiates it from other iron-rich horizons such as ortstein and placic horizons (Soil Survey Staff, 2014).

# 1.3 The Standard Laterite Profile

Not only has the definition of laterite been controversial, but also the typical sequence of a 'normal' laterite profile and its subdivision. Many laterite profiles are the result of truncation and subsequent deposition during successive cycles of pedimentation (e.g., Muggler & Buurman, 2000; Achyuthan & Fedoroff, 2008; see also Fedoroff et al., 2010, 2018) and therefore difficult to compare. A complete in situ profile consists in principle of four layers (Aleva, 1986; Bardossy & Aleva, 1990; Nahon, 1991), from bottom to top: (i) the parent rock, (ii) a saprolite layer (see Zauyah et al., 2010, 2018), (iii) the lateritic layer, and (iv) a gravel-free or gravel-poor cover layer, often with oxic characteristics (see Marcelino et al., 2010, 2018).

Within the lateritic layer several sublayers can be distinguished, from bottom to top: a soft laterite (mottled clay zone), a hard laterite (laterite sensu strictum, for some authors) and a gravel-rich layer (Duchaufour, 1960). Soft laterite was called 'argile tachetée' or 'argile bigarée', by French authors, and hard laterite was named 'carapace' or 'cuirasse' (e.g., Maignien, 1966, Tardy, 1992). The absolute and relative thickness of these sublayers is highly variable.

The soft laterite corresponds to a zone with plinthite (Soil Survey Staff, 2014) and often gradually extends into the hard laterite above and the saprolite beneath. In the lower part, residual saprolite fragments are often present. In some laterites, the mottled zone (so called mottled clay) does not extend to the saprolite and an intermediate zone exists that is called the pallid zone, which has mainly been documented for Australian soils (McCrea et al., 1990). The mottled clay can be either saprolitic material or material that underwent pedoplasmation (see Stoops & Schaefer, 2010, 2018; Zauyah et al., 2010, 2018).

The hard laterite can be nodular or vermicular, depending on the nature of the underlying mottled clay interval. Nodular laterites consist of closely packed hard nodules, derived from hardening of the red mottles followed by loss of white or grey interstitial material of mottled clay. In vermicular laterites, a hard iron-rich body is intersected by numerous tubes filled with soft, generally white, kaolinitic clay and commonly coated by hard, dark ferruginous material, which can be the result of termite activity (de Barros Machado, 1983).

The gravel-rich layer is often allochthonous, which is most commonly documented for occurrences in Africa and India. In this case, it consists mainly of transported iron-rich nodules, mixed with other coarse components. They are often considered as pediment gravel (Fölster et al., 1971).

# 2. Ferritic Laterites

# 2.1 Soft Laterite or Mottled Clay Zone

# 2.1.1 General Characteristics

The microstructure of the mottled clay is mainly massive (Stoops, 1968; Stoops et al., 1990), although channels and vughs can be present in the upper part. The groundmass is homogeneous, with porphyric c/f-related distribution patterns and a grey micromass in the upper part, whereas in the lower part a saprolitic fabric may be present. The micromass usually has an undifferentiated b-fabric in the lower part (Achyuthan & Fedoroff, 2008). In the upper part, where the effects of pedogenic processes are better expressed, the b-fabric is more or less well-developed striated with low interference colours, compatible with a kaolinitic composition. The red spots or streaks, which correspond to plinthite, can occur either as impregnative nodules or as massive impregnative zones interrupted by linear or tubular (vermiform) zones of grey kaolinite. Toward the upper part of the mottled clay zone, the reddish areas become more strongly impregnated and the colour of the groundmass outside these areas changes to greyish yellow (Stoops et al., 1990).

# 2.1.2 Hematite Nodules and Coatings

Diffuse reddish impregnative clusters or streaks correspond to concentrations of small  $(0.5 - 1\mu \mathrm{m})$  hematite crystals (Rosolen et al., 2002) or aggregates (Schmidt-Lorenz, 1980). They often display a specific cellular fabric, referred to as plinthitic cellular fabric throughout this chapter, which was first reported for 'groundwater laterites' from the DR Congo (De Craene & Laruelle, 1955). It was also described in detail and discussed by Schmidt-Lorenz (1964), as part of a study of the genesis and evolution of soft laterites from Sri Lanka and from the type locality Kerala in southern India. His ideas were soon confirmed for African laterites by Stoops (1968) and Réfega (1972). Starting from a homogeneous yellowish groundmass, soft laterite is formed by processes of leaching of silica, resulting in relative accumulation of iron. First, shrinkage of the kaolinitic groundmass leads to opening of fissures and to development of an angular blocky microstructure. The iron oxides dispersed in the micromass migrate to the walls of the blocky aggregates where they form hypocoatings. These hypocoatings, which are dark reddish to opaque in transmitted light and red in oblique incident light, consist of small  $(1 - 10\mu \mathrm{m})$  hematite aggregates called 'laterite droplets' (Hamilton, 1964) or 'plinthitic hematite' (Schmidt-Lorenz, 1980). Further retraction gives rise to secondary fissures where similar hypocoatings gradually form. This process eventually results in the development of a cellular fabric (Figs. 1A and 2). The cells, generally  $70 - 100\mu \mathrm{m}$  in diameter, have a white interior that is mainly composed of kaolinite (Stoops, 1970). Similar hematite hypocoatings have been observed below a hard laterite formed on saprolite, where it is interpreted as a gley feature (Muggler & Buurman, 2000). The hematite was reported to be essentially low in aluminium, which is in agreement with values reported by other authors (Zeese et al., 1994). The sequence of processes

FIGURE 1 (A) Schematic representation of the formation of plinthitic cellular fabric (red points represent hematite grains or aggregates): (1) weakly impregnated hematitic hypocoatings start to develop along planar voids in the homogeneous yellowish mass of kaolinite and fine plinthitic hematite grains; (2) the number of planar voids and the degree of impregnation of the hematitic hypocoatings increases; (3) strongly impregnated hematitic hypocoatings are formed at the expense of nearly purely kaolinitic groundmass.

Based on Stoops (1968).

described above results in relative accumulation of iron and aluminium. Absolute accumulation may occur by deposition of illuvial ferruginous clay in the planar voids formed by shrinkage (see Section 2.1.3).

Based on the study of a large number of laterites in thin section, Schmidt-Lorenz (1974b) concluded that the presence of small round hematite aggregates (plinthitic hematite), typical of laterites, is indicative of ferralitic palaeoweathering in soils from Europe. In African soils, the presence of plinthitic hematite is an indication that the soils developed on laterite-derived colluvial sediments (Stoops, 1989). Good SEM images of plinthitic hematite are difficult to obtain because of its close intermixture with kaolinite (Stoops, 1970; Magaldi & Bidini, 1991). It is not clear whether plinthitic hematite results exclusively from internal redistribution of iron (residual accumulation) or from an input from external sources (absolute accumulation). The formation of plinthitic cellular fabrics is best expressed in clayey materials. Based on thermodynamic considerations,

this has been related to the preferential formation of hematite as iron oxide mineral when porosity is low (Didier et al., 1983).

Impregnation of the hematite nodules and the surrounding groundmass with diffuse goethite was observed in a polygenetic profile in southern Sudan in which a pseudogley developed, due to truncation and changes in environmental conditions (Fölster et al., 1971).

The formation of red hematitic mottles has been explained by the build-up of a high iron oxide concentration as a result of two concurrent processes: precipitation of iron oxides from solution and dissolution of kaolinite, seemingly by a replacement reaction (Ambrosi et al., 1986).

Red mottles associated with the redistribution of iron as a result of hydromorphism can be distinguished from primary ferruginous mottles formed in saprolite derived from

coarse-grained rocks by in situ weathering of ferriferous minerals (Fölster, 1971; Fölster et al., 1971), because they do not display a plinthitic cellular fabric.

Optical and submicroscopic studies of the nodular horizon of laterites on gneiss from Cameroon (Muller & Bocquier, 1987) revealed that the change from ferruginous nodules (with partly preserved lithic fabric) to the interstitial red groundmass was characterised by a gradual loss of lithic fabric and the formation of successive generations of kaolinite, each with smaller particle size (SEM), lower crystallinity and higher degree of iron substitution. This is accompanied by a decrease of the degree of orientation of the particles with respect to the original gneiss fabric. Simultaneously the content of hematite with low Al-substitution decreased with a corresponding increase in amount of goethite with high Al-substitution.

Optical and SEM observations of a transitional pallid zone have shown that most pedogenic clay particles (kaolinite, halloysite) are randomly oriented, giving rise to a very porous internal fabric (McCrea & Gilkes, 1987).

# 2.1.3 Other Coatings, Infillings, Nodules

Coatings and infillings of strongly oriented yellowish clay are often deposited in planar voids and channels (Fig. 3), especially in the upper part of the mottled clay zone (e.g., Magaldi & Bidini, 1991). Inside these coatings, redistribution of iron takes place, whereby hematite hypocoatings form near the wall of the void, eventually producing a plinthitic cellular fabric (see Section 2.1.2.; Figs. 1B and 3). This process can be repeated in successive clay illuviation lamellae (Schmidt-Lorenz, 1964; Stoops, 1968; Réfega, 1972; Miedema et al., 1987).

Iron oxide depletion hypocoatings lined by hypocoatings with plinthitic hematite have been described for the mottled clay interval of Brazilian laterites (Muggler & Buurman, 2000; Rosolen et al., 2002).

Fragments of the underlying saprolite, impregnated with gibbsite, often occur, especially in the lower part of the mottled clay zone (e.g., Alexander & Cady, 1962; Stoops et al., 1990). Passage features and infillings with excrements or soil aggregates are also common and point to high biological activity in this zone, possibly by termites (Stoops et al., 1990; Horváth et al., 2000).

# 2.2 Hard Laterite

# 2.2.1 General Characteristics

The hard laterite in the middle of the profile can be nodular or vermicular. The nodular type is often matrix-supported at the bottom near the soft clay layer, and it evolves to purely nodule-supported in the upper part. In the lowest part of the layer, the nodules are generally large and uncoated, whereas toward the top of the layer they become smaller and have thick kaolinite-goethite coatings (see Section 2.2.3) (e.g., Muller et al., 1980/1981). The vermicular types have a reddish groundmass and are intersected by abundant channels. The latter are generally filled with white kaolinitic clay at the bottom of the layer, more yellowish clay higher in the layer and soil material with oxic characteristics near the top. The channels in the upper part of the layer often show kaolinite-goethite coatings (see Section 2.2.3.). Both types of hard laterite can also display other pedofeatures, such as illuvial clay coatings and infillings, infillings with excrements, coatings and infillings of pure goethite.

In autochthonous laterites, the nodules are typically orthic or disorthic. They have a same type of groundmass as the surrounding loose material, and a continuity exists between the coarse material inside and outside the nodules (Muller et al., 1980/1981). The nodules and the loose interstitial material are often subjected to later iron oxide impregnation, affecting mainly the interstitial material and giving rise to complex fabrics. When vertical or lateral input of iron is considerable, continuous hard layers form by cementation of the nodules.

A specific type of autochthonous nodular laterite was described by Lambiv Dzemua et al. (2011) for the top of mottled saprolite on serpentine. It consists of packed fragments of iron oxide coatings and hypocoatings, which remain after total dissolution and leaching of the kaolinitic groundmass, producing a locally highly porous deposit. Although not often reported, this type of nodular laterite can be expected to be common on mafic rocks with low aluminium content.

The infillings in vermicular laterite and the material between the nodules in nodular laterites have similar characteristics. They often display a granular microstructure, a yellowish or reddish micromass, an undifferentiated b-fabric and signs of intense bioturbation, which are all features that are commonly recognised for oxic materials (see Marcelino et al., 2010, 2018). In other cases, the groundmass has characteristics of less strongly developed tropical soils, with abundant illuvial coatings of limpid fine clay and striated b-fabrics (Muller et al., 1980/1981; Costantini & Priori, 2007). Phytoliths are sometimes observed, indicating that the material is derived from overlying soils, which in many cases have been subsequently removed by erosion.

The evolution of soft matrix-supported mottles to hard nodule-supported zones has been attributed to purely relative accumulation of iron and/or aluminium by loss of alkali and earth alkali elements and silica (Nahon, 1986; Widdowson, 2007), which, however, has never been confirmed by thin section studies. On the contrary, inputs of dissolved or colloidal iron and aluminium and/or of mechanically transported ferruginous clay are clearly expressed by the presence of iron- and aluminium-rich clay coatings in voids formed by shrinkage of the original volume by loss of the more soluble elements. These coatings are subjected to the same processes as the groundmass (formation of hematite hypocoatings, destruction of kaolinite; see Section 2.1.2; Figs. 1B and 3) (Stoops, 1968; Réfega, 1972). In some cases, desilicification of kaolinite gives rise to gibbsite formation (Boulange, 1983), which means that relative accumulation of aluminium takes place within materials formed as a result of absolute accumulation of iron, aluminium and silica in the form of clay.

# 2.2.2 Nodules

Authigenic nodules generally show a fabric similar to that of the underlying mottled clay (Stoops et al., 1990), but they have a denser concentration of plinthitic hematite, as well as goethite impregnations and coatings along voids (Fölster, 1971). They also have better expressed cellular fabrics than nodules in the mottled clay. Due to leaching of oxides and weathering of kaolinite, the intensity of the interference colours of the micromass inside the cells decreases and the micromass material is gradually removed. The result is an empty boxwork in iron-rich laterites, or a boxwork with fine-grained gibbsite inside the cells in aluminium-bearing laterites. SEM observations showing the corrosion of quartz grains (Eswaran & Raghu Mohan, 1973; Stoops et al., 1990) also point to strong leaching of silica. The groundmass of the nodules shows either a saprolitic fabric or a soil fabric, depending on the degree of pedoturbation before iron or aluminium enrichment took place.

# 2.2.3 Kaolinite-Goethite Coatings

The walls of channels and other voids, as well as the sides of nodules (mainly in the upper part of the hard laterite), are generally covered by kaolinite-goethite coatings (Figs. 4 to 6). These coatings are a few hundred micrometres to several millimetres thick (up to  $1\mathrm{cm}$ ), laminated, orange and brownish yellow in PPL and yellow in OIL (Table 1). In reflected light with polarisers at an angle of  $60^{\circ}$ , they are greyish blue, which has been interpreted as an indication for the presence of hydrated goethite (Alexandre, 2002). The thickness of individual laminae is not constant, ranging from 50 to  $100\mu \mathrm{m}$ , and they do not always follow the irregularities of the covered surface (Figs. 4 to 6). The coatings do not show extinction lines, and in most cases they do not go into extinction at all but display a speckled extinction pattern (Fig. 4B). Occasionally, they contain thin layers (few  $\mu \mathrm{m}$ ) of pure goethite with palisade fabric. These coatings are very common in the upper part of the hard laterite, but they are also abundant on most pediment gravels (see Section 2.3), and they import great rigidity to the laterites (Alexander & Cady, 1962).

Tangential cross-sections through these thick coatings can produce concentric patterns similar to concentric nodules (see Stoops, 2003).

The origin of the kaolinite-goethite coatings is not yet well understood. Their internal and external fabric and their optical characteristics do not indicate an illuvial nature. The parallelism of the bands in the coatings is often very imperfect and irregular and, in addition, coarse quartz grains frequently interrupt the continuity of the bands (Fig. 5), which is incompatible with an illuvial origin. According to Horváth et al. (2000), this type of coatings would indicate vadose conditions and precipitation from solution. However, their formation has been also attributed to termite activity (de Barros Machado, 1983, 1987), based on structural similarities with termite galleries and on the common occurrence of organic particles that are also found in termite constructions (plant splitters, chitin fragments). Based on observations for samples from several regions, the coatings appear to be built by regular packing, layer by layer, of termite pellets, which are either fecal or buccal, later enriched in iron oxides by circulating groundwater (de Barros Machado, 1983, 1987). The piling of pellets could explain the speckled b-fabric. The influence of termite activity on the formation of laterites was earlier put forward by Yakushev (1968), based on similarities in fabric.

Similar coatings in outcrops of hard laterites, covering its surface and occurring along the sides of vertical cracks, have a layered fabric with local cross-bedding, attributed to iron oxide precipitation from surface water, partly controlled by microbial activity under temporarily arid conditions (Alexandre & Tshidibi, 1985). The color of these coatings, which can be covered by a siliceous deposit similar to desert varnish, has been related to the age of the surface (Alexandre, 2002).

According to the French school (see Nahon et al., 1977; Nahon, 1991), the formation of clay-goethite coatings around hematite-kaolinite nodules is the result of internal reorganisation: centripetal destruction of the kaolinite-hematite mass of the nodule, by desilicification and by obliteration of microporosity, would lead to loosening of thin shells of aluminium-rich hematite from the nodule surface and their transformation to aluminium-rich goethite layers; the size of the hematitic core is gradually reduced at the expense of the growing cortex, finally producing a concentric nodule. However, this theory does not explain the commonly observed difference in coarse material content between the nodules and the surrounding coatings. According to McFarlane (1983), this is the result of the growth of coatings around the nodule, pushing quartz grains toward the internodular space. Delvigne (1998) describes the coating as an accretion cortex formed by recrystallisation of iron oxides and disappearance of secondary voids. The formation of concentric nodules (pisolitisation) has been also associated with the degradation of laterites at the expense of the underlying continuous laterite layer with a lithic fabric (Boulange, 1984).

# 2.2.4 Goethite Coatings and Infillings

Planar voids in kaolinite-goethite coatings and in nodules are often filled with pure goethite. Macroscopically, these features are recognised as very dark brown to black shiny surfaces. In thin sections, pure goethite coatings are layered, with platy crystals oriented perpendicular to the surface (Fig. 5). SEM observations have also documented this fabric, and they show that the individual crystals are fine lenticular and often split (Stoops, 1970; Eswaran & Raghu Mohan, 1973; Suddhiprakarn & Kheoruenromne, 1994) (Fig. 7). Acicular goethite has also been reported as the main constituent of layered goethite coatings (Eswaran et al., 1981; Zauyah & Bisdom, 1983; Stubendorff, 1986). Goethite in these coatings and infillings seems to have a relatively high degree of aluminium substitution (Stoops et al., 1990; Tardy, 1993), corroborated by analyses for similar coatings with a palisadic internal fabric (Zeese et al., 1994). Hematite and goethite coatings covering hard laterite surfaces are mentioned by Alexandre (2002), but it is not clear to what extent they are associated with the kaolinite-goethite coatings described above.

Goethite coatings and infillings have been considered to be a diagnostic feature of hardened laterite (Rutherford, 1972).

# 2.2.5 Manganese Features

Micromorphological descriptions of manganese features in laterites are rare; but a number of petrographic studies have been published (see Varentsov, 2013). This scarcity of data may be due in part to the opaque nature of manganese oxides, requiring reflected light microscopy combined with SEM-EDS to be differentiated. Manganese features are common on parent materials containing manganese minerals, ranging from carbonates (rhodochrosite) to silicates (e.g., braunite, spessartine garnet, ottrelite). Manganese laterites are economically important secondary ores, both as source of manganese and, particularly on serpentine deposits, as source of metals such as cobalt and nickel.

In saprolites on metasedimentary manganese deposits rich in rhodochrosite  $(\mathrm{Mn}(\mathrm{CO}_3))$  and spessartine  $(\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}_{3}\mathrm{Al}_2(\mathrm{SiO}_4)_3)$ , the first weathering product is manganite  $(\mathrm{Mn}^{3+}\mathrm{O(OH)})$ , forming well-crystallised infillings in fissures and, in some cases, producing pseudomorphs after primary minerals (Nahon et al., 1983). Near the edge of the voids clear needle-shaped crystals are visible with SEM. For similar deposits, Grandin and Perseil (1977, 1983) describe the formation of lithiophorite ((Al,Li)  $(\mathrm{Mn}^{4+},\mathrm{Mn}^{3+})_2\mathrm{O}_2(\mathrm{OH})_2)$  pseudomorphs after spessartine in the lower part of the profile. In the upper part of the same profile, a manganese-rich zone is formed, generally preserving a lithic fabric, containing predominantly lithiophorite, besides other manganese oxides such as cryptomelane  $(\mathrm{K}(\mathrm{Mn}^{4+}_{7}\mathrm{Mn}^{3+})\mathrm{O}_{16})$ , nsutite  $(\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}_{\mathrm{x}}\mathrm{Mn}^{4+}_{1-\mathrm{x}}\mathrm{O}_{2-2\mathrm{x}}(\mathrm{OH})_{2\mathrm{x}})$  and pyrolusite  $(\mathrm{MnO}_2)$ , depending on the original mineralogical composition of the deposits. For another region, a sequence of cryptomelane over nsutite and ramsdallite

$\mathrm{(MnO_2)}$  to pyrolusite, during pseudomorphic replacement of primary Mn minerals and kaolinite, was described by Beauvais et al. (1987). Rod- or needle-shaped crystals of cryptomelane are recognised with SEM. Gradual replacement of kaolinite by lithiophorite, with progressive development of lithiophorite pseudomorphs after kaolinite booklets, was also described by Nahon et al. (1989).

For the top of the hard laterite on ultrabasic rocks in Cameroon, Yongue-Fouateu et al. (2006) describe the presence of zones with lithic fabrics, dominated by cryptomelane and lithiophorite evolving to minerals of the asbolane group  $(\mathrm{Mn}^{4+}(\mathrm{O},\mathrm{OH})_2 \cdot (\mathrm{Co},\mathrm{Ni},\mathrm{Mg},\mathrm{Ca})_x(\mathrm{OH})_{2x} \cdot n\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O})$ . Manganese coatings composed of globular aggregates and acicular crystals have been reported for the higher parts of in situ hard laterites in Bangalore (Eswaran & Raghu Mohan, 1973). Reflected light microscopy and microprobe studies by Lambiv Dzemua et al. (2013) document in situ formation of Co-Ni-rich lithiophorite in the lower part of a laterite on serpentine in Cameroon. The lithiophorite encloses magnetite grains in the basal part of the profile, just above the saprolite, and it occurs as coatings and hypocoatings of voids with coarse-crystalline gibbsite infillings in the overlying layer, where it records a more recent stage of absolute aluminium accumulation.

# 2.2.6 Other Features

Desilicification resulting in separation of fragments of fractured quartz grains, with dissolution progressing along the fractures, has been commonly reported to occur from the saprolite onward (Chauvel et al., 1983; Nahon, 1986; Widdowson, 2007; Bremer, 2010). Fragmentation of quartz grains is an essential process in lateritic weathering, as emphasised by Brimhall et al. (1992) based on the results of microscopic and physicochemical studies. Earlier studies by Claisse (1972) concluded that quartz grains extracted from alterites were more soluble than other quartz grains when treated with strong acids.

Another common feature in hard laterite is the presence of quartz grains with fissures filled with gibbsite (Fig. 8A to C) or hematite (Fig. 8D), described as 'runiquartz' (Eswaran et al., 1975) (see also Kaloga, 1976; Achyuthan, 2004; Marcelino et al., 2010, 2018). The presence of runiquartz grains, which are very resistant, usually points to a lateritic origin of the coarse fraction of the soil in which they occur (Stoops, 1989).

In thin sections, fragments of quartz grains often show optical continuity (Fig. 8C), expressed by simultaneous extinction, which points to in situ alteration (Chauvel et al., 1983). Quartz dissolution may also be revealed by the presence of circumgranular voids (Muller et al., 1980/1981), resulting in so-called floating quartz grains (Fig. 9). These quartz grains show deeply etched surfaces in SEM images. Gibbsite, generally with palisadic fabric, sometimes crystallises in the created contact voids, which may eventually produce complete infillings of mouldic voids after total dissolution of the quartz grain (Delvigne & Boulange, 1974; Schmidt-Lorenz, 1974a, 1974b). SEM observations of quartz grains have also shown that grains surrounded by hematite exhibit a powdery surface, interpreted as amorphous or microcrystalline silica; quartz grains in a goethitic

environment display polyhedral etch figures, without iron oxide infillings, suggesting that iron oxide precipitation took place before quartz dissolution (Tshidibi, 1985).

Other features that have occasionally been reported, including pyrite occurrence in buried laterites and the presence of non-biogenic leucophosphite  $\mathrm{(KFe^{3+})_2(PO_4)_2(OH)}\cdot 2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  in hard laterite crusts (Tiessen et al., 1996), presumably formed after laterite development.

# 2.3 Gravel-Rich Layer

The gravel-rich layer in the upper part of laterite profiles is often allochthonous and then consists mainly of transported iron-rich nodules, occasionally mixed with other coarse components such as lithic fragments (e.g., Zinn & Bigham, 2016). Depending on the length of transport and the geological uniformity of the region, this material can be more or less heterogeneous, showing different degrees of development based on fabric and composition. Even when it is derived from a same parent material, fragments exhibiting

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/04e25fc3-a601-4d55-8f22-ee6b8df8e0d7/211acc948682ba53d9444f24152a32d2911c8d99b10cfd29bacb79616d61fb31.jpg)  
FIGURE 9 SEM image of a corroded sand-sized quartz grain, with an associated circumgranular void, in a hard laterite (Uganda).

different stages of evolution occur, as upslope profiles are truncated up to different depths. In many cases, fragments have undergone several cycles of cementation and transport. In the literature, numerous terms have been used to designate them, without any generally accepted definition, but they can all be described in terms of typic, concentric and nucleic nodules (Stoops, 2003).

Nodule-supported layers often have a conglomeratic aspect, with nodules as sharply delimited fabric units of different degrees of complexity and of various origins, as can be deduced from their internal fabric and composition (Fig. 10). The nodules are generally cemented, producing a hard continuous layer. This evolution corresponds to an absolute accumulation of iron, a decrease of the  $\mathrm{Fe_{ox} / Fe_{DCB}}$  ratio and an increase in goethite content (Eswaran et al., 1981).

The most commonly observed nodule types are:

- Typic nodules with saprolitic fabric: saprolite fragments impregnated by iron oxides, whereby the degree of impregnation is related to water table position. The outlines and arrangement of minerals remain visible and weatherable minerals can be present. Boxwork pseudomorphs after ferromagnesian minerals can occur, pointing to residual iron accumulation.  
- Typic nodules with soil fabric: soil material impregnated by iron oxides, often containing pedofeatures such as clay coatings. Their presence is an indication of truncation of iron oxide-impregnated soils in the surroundings.

FIGURE 10 Rounded laterite fragments of different compositions and origins, cemented by goethite-impregnated material in a hard polygenetic laterite (upper terrace of the Niger River, Burkina Faso).

- Typic nodules with plinthic cellular fabric (see Section 2.1.2): rounded fragments of hardened plinthite, in different stages of development.  
- Concentric nodules: nodules with concentric patterns, either aluminium- or iron-rich, of different genetic types. They often consist of small nucleus covered by several kaolinite-goethite coatings, which correspond to the pisolithic facies of Alexandre (2002). Concentric nodules containing charcoal fragments and iron oxide coatings have been also reported (Achyuthan & Fedoroff, 2008). Tangential cross-sections through kaolinite-goethite coatings can be mistaken for concentric nodules (see Section 2.2.3).  
- Complex nodules: nodules consisting of fragments of older nodules, completely or partly surrounded by kaolinite-goethite coatings. They can include fragments of older kaolinite-goethite coatings and clearly have a polygenetic origin.  
- Manganiferous nodules: manganese nodules have been reported for lateritic profiles in Western Africa (Beauvais & Nahon, 1985). Large nodules often have a core displaying a lithic fabric (including pseudomorphs after primary minerals), consisting of a mixture of cryptocrystalline todorkite  $(\mathrm{Na}, \mathrm{Ca}, \mathrm{K}, \mathrm{Ba}, \mathrm{Sr})_{1-x}$ $\mathrm{(Mn,Mg,Al)}_6\mathrm{O}_{12} \cdot 3 - 4\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O})$ , birnessite  $\mathrm{(Na,Ca,K)}_{0.6}(\mathrm{Mn}^{4+}, \mathrm{Mn}^{3+})_2\mathrm{O}_4 \cdot 1.5\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O})$ , lithiophorite and goethite. This core is surrounded by a compound coating with concentric layers dominated, from centre to nodule surface, by cryptocrystalline nsutite, cryptomelane and well-crystallised lithiophorite. In smaller nodules, the core is very small or absent and the dominant feature is the compound coating, similar in composition to the one described above, but in some cases with several

repetitions of the complete sequence. The Mn content decreases toward the surface of the nodule, whereas the Al content increases. The coatings are interpreted by the authors as having formed by centripetal growth. Similar coatings, but containing plant fragments as inclusion, were observed by Grandin and Perseil (1977) for samples from Ivory Coast. Compound nodules with an iron- and manganese-rich core, with birnessite and vernadite  $(\mathrm{Mn,Fe,Ca,Na})(\mathrm{O,OH})_2\cdot n\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O})$  as the main manganese compounds, and surrounded by thick iron oxide coatings, were described in India by Achyuthan (2004). Their formation requires external input of manganese, which involves processes other than those resulting in laterite development by residual accumulation.

- Sandy nodules: nodules formed in sandy materials, often in alluvial deposits. They form as a result of lateral transport of iron, leading to the development of iron oxide nodules (Bocquier, 1973; Bourman et al., 1987) or continuous cemented layers (e.g., Denisoff, 1957; Alexandre, 2002). The nodules or layers first have a chitonic c/f-related distribution pattern, which evolves to close porphyric, with all packing voids filled by goethite. A similar fabric is often observed for Cenozoic ferruginous sandstones in Europe. Although this material as such is not lateritic, these goethite-impregnated sandy nodules frequently occur in allochthonous gravel-rich laterite layers. Leaching of the gravel-rich laterite layer, removing iron oxides and clay, can produce a material in which the nodules are transformed to entirely deferruginised earthy aggregates (Bellier et al., 1987).

In Oxisols of Malaysia, assumed tubular goethite occurs both within lateritic nodules and along their sides (Zauyah & Bisdom, 1981; Zauyah, 1983). SEM images show hollow tubes with a cross-section of  $2 - 3\mu \mathrm{m}$ , but no mineralogical or chemical data are given. Similar tubular features were observed by Comerma et al. (1977) for petroplinthite from Venezuela.

In Mediterranean regions, plinthite or palaeoplinthite may be superposed on unrelated soil materials, such as Bt horizons. In thin sections, the plinthite-related features include iron oxide hypocoatings and impregnative nodules (Rellini et al., 2007).

Gravelly petroplinthite composed of nodules within a grey groundmass with speckled b-fabric were reported for the Ligurian coast in Italy (Rellini et al., 2015). The nodules are of various compositional types and have sharp boundaries, pointing to an allochthonous origin.

# 3. Bauxites and Bauxitic Laterites

As mentioned in the Introduction, deeply buried bauxites and karst bauxites are not considered in this review. In aluminium-rich laterites and bauxites, several types of gibbsite enrichment can be observed in thin sections.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/04e25fc3-a601-4d55-8f22-ee6b8df8e0d7/8e0e37c1609961692a93ec6c4cde08a75c7d42a875475e0c7852cf68de244b19.jpg)

In the lower part of bauxitic laterite profiles, at the transition to the fresh rock, the fabric of the parent rock can be preserved (e.g., de Oliveira et al. 2013). Occasionally this phenomenon is observed throughout the profile (Boulange et al., 1975). In the case of coarse-grained rocks, the outlines of mineral grains can be recognised (Fig. 11) and a boxwork pattern develops with empty cells, or with cells filled with cryptocrystalline gibbsite resulting from residual aluminium accumulation due to leaching of silica (Bocquier et al., 1983; Boulange, 1983; Melfi & Carvalho, 1983; Groke et al., 1983). Also mouldic voids, developed as a result of leaching of more soluble elements, may be filled with coarse-crystalline gibbsite in the overlying layers, resulting in absolute aluminium accumulation (de Oliveira et al. 2013). This sometimes evolves to a continuous gibbsite groundmass around saprolitic nodules impregnated by iron oxides, explained by external input of aluminium (Fig. 12).

Relatively coarse-grained gibbsite  $(20 - 50\mu \mathrm{m})$  (Fig. 12B), oriented normal to the sides of the original voids, has been described as the main constituent of the cement between

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/04e25fc3-a601-4d55-8f22-ee6b8df8e0d7/134321588ad840ba7493cf9b538ac2dcd4fe15878e444dd3ff92aafe6367b400.jpg)

iron-rich aggregates in the lower or middle part of bauxite profiles (Lucas et al., 1989; Dedecker & Stoops, 1993). In this setting, it forms septa between lateritic or saprolitic nodules. The occurrence of coarse-grained gibbsite in depth has also been reported by other authors (e.g., Kotschoubey et al., 1989). The formation of gibbsite coatings has been attributed mainly to desilicification of illuvial kaolinite coatings (Boulange et al., 1975; Boulange, 1983, 1985).

Microcrystalline gibbsite is generally rather pure, but it sometimes contains inclusions of clayey material (Fig. 13). It has been observed at the transition between a cemented bauxite layer and its clay cover (Lucas et al., 1989; Dedecker & Stoops, 1993). It forms a continuous layer at the bottom, and a discontinuous nodular layer in the lower part of the cover, and it gradually disappears toward the upper part. The formation of microcrystalline gibbsite probably results from the removal of silica and iron from the originally iron-bearing kaolinitic groundmass (Schmidt-Lorenz, 1964). SEM studies by Bardossy et al. (1978) have shown that gibbsite in strongly leached lateritic bauxites of highland areas is relatively coarse-grained  $(0.5 - 50\mu \mathrm{m})$  and euhedral, whereas in lowland lateritic bauxites the gibbsite is finer  $(0.1 - 10\mu \mathrm{m})$  and subhedral or anhedral, which is still coarser than the very fine-grained xenotopic gibbsite  $(0.05 - 0.5\mu \mathrm{m})$  in karst bauxites. As a result of the destruction of the clay, the groundmass is transformed to microcrystalline gibbsite material, iron is concentrated as hematite hypocoatings along planar voids (see Section 2.1.2) (Banerji, 1989; Varajao et al., 1989) and coarse-grained gibbsite develops in the available pore space as coatings and infillings of vughs, shrinkage cracks and circumgranular voids around dissolving quartz grains (Schmidt-Lorenz, 1974b).

Cryptocrystalline gibbsite is often observed in bauxitic material, especially in karst bauxites. It has the appearance of colloidal material, and it is the main component of nucleic or concentric bauxitic nodules (Fig. 14). The nucleus is a clastic mineral particle. The number of layers within the coating is typically between 2 and 10, but it may exceed 20, with a thickness of 1 to  $100\mu \mathrm{m}$  and gradual to sharp boundaries (Bárdossy, 1982). Nodules with a diameter between  $100\mu \mathrm{m}$  and  $1\mathrm{mm}$  are the most common. They are

characterised by layers with sharp boundaries, the inner layers closely following the outlines of the nucleus but changing to a more rounded shape away from the centre. The layers are visible due to small changes in iron oxide content. Eccentrically concentric nodules ('spastoids'; Bárdossy, 1982) are common in some bauxites. The outer layer can enclose smaller nodules, engulfed by the faster growing larger nodule. The nodules are interpreted as authigenic diagenetic features (Bárdossy, 1982). In older deposits, with considerable overburden, the nodules may be flattened horizontally. Sometimes new layers surround fragmented nodules (Fig. 14B).

Gibbsiteic nodules are characteristic of bauxitic hard laterites. In a homogeneous gibbsite-hematite groundmass, typic nodules are first formed by iron redistribution under hydromorphic conditions (Boulange & Bocquier, 1983). Iron moves to cracks (cf. ferritic laterites), structural elements become more rounded and an internodular mass rich in boehmite (AlO(OH)) develops. Within the internodular mass, other nodules appear, with a centre depleted in iron oxides and a strongly developed iron oxide hypocoating. They are later covered by a coating of boehmite and recrystallised gibbsite. A repetition of this process results in the formation of concentric gibbsite nodules. Subsequent shrinkage of the nodules can lead to the formation of radial fissures, giving rise to concentric and septaric complex nodules.

Other gibbsite features include gravel layers composed of rounded gibbsite nodules (Dedecker & Stoops, 1999). Various types of gibbsite pedofeatures in laterites are illustrated by Delvigne (1998).

# 4. Conclusions

Based on available published data, it is not possible to give an unequivocal interpretation of each observed fabric unit in a laterite, isolated from the field context. Hematitic

features seem rather related to residual accumulation of iron, whereas goethitic features commonly indicate an external input of iron, in a more porous system. Infillings with gibbsite indicate absolute accumulation of aluminium by vertical or lateral transport in solution or in the form of clay suspensions.

Compared with most other regolith materials, laterites and bauxites are characterised by relative coarse fabric units. This implies that the use of large thin sections is often required. To distinguish different fabrics in parts with high iron oxide content, sections should be as thin as possible, and OIL observations can provide useful complementary information. However, when the iron oxide content is high ( $>15 - 20\%$ ), the fabric of bauxites is difficult to observe in thin sections (Bárdossy & Panto, 1971). X-ray computed topography seems a promising tool for studies of some aspects of the fabric of lateritic materials (Zinn et al., 2015).

A review of the extensive literature on laterites and bauxites makes it clear that interpretation of the copious data is difficult because of the lack of precise and complete descriptions, and the use of imprecise and generally undefined terminologies, both for field observations and in thin section studies. Published micromorphological interpretations are often based on a single profile, or a small number of related profiles, and often not sufficiently supported by other data. A genetic grouping of the observed features in a comprehensive way is not an easy task, as it may imply the acceptance of a general model of genesis and evolution.

The presence of mottles with fine plinthitic hematite forming hypocoatings along planar voids and the disaggregation and congruent dissolution of quartz grains are diagnostic for in situ lateritisation by relative iron accumulation. Absolute accumulation of iron results in the formation of goethite and goethite-kaolinite coatings around hematite/goethite nodules.

Micromorphological observations are an indispensable tool to understand the spatial and chronological relations between the various constituents of these often polygenetic materials. The information they provide pertains not only to the processes that took place but, more importantly, also to the hierarchy of those processes. Micromorphological studies are therefore in many cases necessary to be able to interpret the results of geochemical analysis.

# 1. Introduction

Soils formed on volcanic sediments (pyroclastic material) have particular characteristics, which differentiate them from soils derived from other parent materials. During the initial stages of weathering, especially of the volcanic glass, extensive accumulations of nanocrystalline Si-Al components, such as allophane and imogolite, are produced. As a result, these soils have specific physical and chemical properties, with regard to for

example pH-dependent surface charge, P retention, alkaline reaction with NaF, bulk density and thixotropy, as well as specific micromorphological characteristics. For young soils, this has resulted in their grouping at the highest taxonomic levels in international soil classification systems: the Andosol reference group in WRB (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015) and the Andisol order in Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 2014). Some of these characteristics (e.g., undifferentiated b-fabric) remain detectable even in more developed soils. This is reflected by the prefix qualifier Andic added to the soil group name in WRB (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015) and to the subgroup level name in Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 2014). Throughout this manuscript, only WRB terminology will be used, except where soil orders of the Soil Taxonomy system are cited as mentioned in the original publication.

The first micromorphological descriptions of soils on volcanic ash were probably made by Kubiëna (1956) and later by Frei (1964). The first systematic paper on Andosol micromorphology is by Kawai (1969). Spanish pedologists published a large number of micromorphological studies on soils from the Canary Islands in the 19 seventies and eighties (e.g., Benayas et al., 1974, 1978, 1980; Tejedor Salguero et al., 1975, 1978, 1979; Rodríguez-Rodriguez et al., 1979, 1980a, 1980b, 1988). The micromorphology of volcanic ash soils in Europe has been reviewed by Stoops (2007).

The general trend of pedogenic evolution on volcanic parent materials under humid climates consists of a transition of soils with amorphous fine compounds toward soils with crystalline clay. This crystallisation process creates the preconditions for clay illuviation so that Andosols evolve to soils with an argic horizon. In Europe such soils are often palaeosols (e.g., Quantin et al., 1978; Tejedor Salguero et al., 1978).

The evolution of Andosols to soils with crystalline clay proceeds via transitional stages, known as 'intergrade' Andosols (Fernández-Caldas et al., 1982), in which some features of Andosols are preserved (thick A horizon, relatively high content of the oxalate-extractable Fe and Al), but which already include a high proportion of crystalline clay in the fine material (often halloysite).

Little information has been published on the micromorphology of Podzols on volcanic ash. Also Ferralsols, Vertisols and arid soils on volcanic ash have received little attention in the literature.

The micromorphology of subsurface indurated horizons that formed in pyroclastic materials or their derivates in volcanic regions of Central and South America have received some attention (Hidalgo et al., 1992; Oleschko et al., 1992; Poetsch & Arikas, 1997; Jongmans et al., 2000; Poetsch, 2004). They are known under various local names (tepetates, talpetates, cangahua, nadis). In the WRB classification, they mostly fit the definition of either duric or fragile horizon (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015). Originally they are located in the subsoil of moderately weathered soils (Luvisols, Vertisols, Cambisols) constituting their BC horizons, but they are frequently exposed along the surface due to erosion. The most important cementing agent is pedogenic amorphous silica (e.g., Miehlich, 1992; Poetsch & Arikas, 1997; see also Gutiérrez-Castorena & Effland, 2010; Gutiérrez-Castorena, 2018) but allophane and imogolite have been detected as well (Jongmans et al., 2000).

Not all soils with andic properties are formed on volcanic parent materials. Addition of volcanic ash to soils on non-volcanic substrates in the vicinity of active volcanoes is often sufficient to give rise to chemical, mineralogical and micromorphological properties similar to those of Andosols (e.g., Vingiani et al., 2014). It also can be at the origin of a melanic variant of the Mollic horizon. On the other hand, soils on volcanic formations can show non-andic properties as a result of a high input of other materials, e.g., of aeolian origin, as described for parts of the Canary Islands where dust derived from the Sahara is deposited in large quantities (von Suchodoletz et al., 2009). Soils with andic properties have been described for non-volcanic parent materials (e.g., shales), but no micromorphological research has been published.

This chapter gives a structured overview of the micromorphological characteristics of soils and regoliths formed on volcanic ash. It demonstrates that soils formed on tephra are quite different from those formed on other parent materials.

# 2. Microstructure

In an initial stage of soil formation, tephra have a coarse monic basic microstructure (Fig. 1A), which evolves to chitonic when fine material becomes available (see also Section 3.2). The c/f ratio varies between 15/1 to 20/1 as described for ashes of historic eruptions (e.g., Stoops et al., 2006; Stoops & Gérard, 2007), in boreal conditions (e.g., Sokolov, 1972; Simpson et al., 1999; Shoba et al., 2004; Stoops et al., 2008) and in arid environments (Stoops, unpublished data). When more fine material is present, fine aggregates form, leading to a chito-enaulic or enaulic basic microstructure, which evolves to a granular microstructure.

Andosols are characterised throughout the world by a well-separated granular microstructure (see Figs. 1B to D, and 2D), which changes to enaulic, chitonic and coarse monic basic microstructures with increasing depth. In young or coarse-textured soils, an enaulic basic microstructure is observed. The size of the granular peds ranges from 30 to  $400\mu \mathrm{m}$  (e.g., Bech-Borras et al., 1977) and has been reported to increase with depth (Bech-Borras et al., 1977; Benayas et al., 1980; Zarei et al., 1997). In tropical Andosols, small granules  $(50~{\mu\mathrm{m}})$  are often coalescent, forming larger aggregates  $(1.5\mathrm{mm})$  (Stoops, 1983). Bimodal granular microstructures have been recognised for surface horizons (Colombo et al., 2007). The peds usually show a uniform internal fabric, although concentric fabrics may be found in deeper layers or in transported materials (Fig. 1C) (Stoops, 1972, 2013; Stoops & Gerard, 2007). Biogenic pores are common, especially in the upper horizons. They occur in the form of channels and vugs, sometimes filled by loosely packed excrements.

The origin of the granular microstructure or the enaulic basic microstructure has not been clarified. The bimodal microstructures in A horizons, combined with granular infillings (Colombo et al., 2007), support the theory of a biological origin. However, the fact that granular microstructures have been observed for deeper parts of the profile and in soils with very restricted biological activity, such as soils on volcanic ash in boreal

regions (Stoops et al., 2008) and on Santorini (Stoops et al. 2006; Stoops & Gérard, 2007), suggests that other processes may also be responsible. Dubroeucq et al. (2002) considered the granules as excrements of Enchytraeidae and nematodes. Shin and Stoops (1988) and Colombo et al. (2007) mentioned that the granular microstructure is better expressed in thin sections of air-dried material, than in those of samples for which acetone replacement was used. Observed microstructures can be partly an artifact caused by drying, especially in Hydrandepts (Chartres et al., 1985).

In the Bw horizon of Andosols the granular microstructure is often replaced by a blocky structure (e.g., Dubroeucq et al., 2002), combined with a moderately or weakly separated intrapedal granular microstructure. A (sub)angular blocky and locally massive microstructure has been reported to predominate in A horizons of imperfectly drained Andosols (Nieuwenhuyse et al., 1993).

Intergrades of Andosols to soils with crystalline clay display a specific set of micromorphological features, studied for a buried volcanic soil chronosequence in Central

Mexico (Sedov et al., 2003b). Their Ah horizons have a granular microstructure with abundant packing voids in some (subordinate) parts and a subangular blocky microstructure with fewer planes and channels in other parts.

In soils on volcanic ash with a Bt horizon, a granular microstructure is still dominant throughout the profile, although it is sometimes more complex than in the less developed soils. In red Mediterranean soils on lapilli on the Canary Islands, the microstructure is granular in the upper part of the profile, becoming more compact with depth due to compaction and agglomeration of the granules (Fedoroff & Rodriguez, 1978). A more compact microstructure in Bt or Bw horizons has also been reported in other studies (Goenadi & Tan, 1989).

In cold areas, soils on volcanic ash often display a platy or lenticular microstructure (Romans et al., 1980; Stoops & Gerard, 2007; Stoops et al., 2008) resulting from frost action (see Van Vliet-Lanoe, 2010; Van Vliet-Lanoe & Fox, 2018). The lenticular aggregates can preserve an intrapedal granular microstructure (Stoops et al., 2008).

In Ferralsols on volcanic substrates, documented for the Canary Islands, a less granular and more blocky microstructure than in Andosols is generally observed (Rodríguez-Rodriguez et al., 1988) and a porphyric c/f-related distribution pattern gradually appears (Tan & Goenadi, 1994). In relatively young Ferralsols a weak blocky microstructure prevails, becoming granular with increasing age (West et al., 1997).

In Vertisols derived from volcanic materials, a fine granular or fine blocky microstructure was observed for the A horizon, becoming angular blocky with centimetre-sized peds in the Bw horizon (Rodriguez Hernandez et al., 1979).

For soils on volcanic ash of arid areas, little information is available. Zarei et al. (1997), studying soils from the arid Fuerteventura island (eastern Canary Islands), stated that, depending on their texture, the surface horizons have an enaulic and chitonic c/f-related distribution pattern, grading to a granular microstructure, which gradually changes with depth to angular blocky and spongy microstructure, with common granular infillings. The same authors observed that the expression of the round peds increases with increasing abundance of amorphous material. In a calcic Gypsiorthid near Raqqa (Syria) (Stoops, 1980), the granular microstructure and micromass coatings around pyroclasts strongly resemble those in weakly developed soils as described before (Fig. 1D).

Paddy soils on young volcanic ash material show characteristics that are not related to the Andosol fabric, but rather to hydromorphic soils (see Lindbo et al., 2010; Vepraskas et al., 2018), except for the composition of the coarse fraction of the groundmass. The microstructure is blocky, or massive with channels, and the c/f-related distribution pattern is always porphyric (Stoops, 1984).

Duric or fragile horizons, such as tepetate, usually have a loamy texture with a porphyric c/f-related distribution pattern (Alfaro Sánchez et al., 1992). Pores are rare, presented mostly by thin, discontinuous, poorly interconnected fissures and very sparse channels. Jongmans et al. (2000) documented a chitonic c/f-related distribution pattern due to the presence of non-crystalline Al-silicate coatings.

According to Stoops and Gérard (2007) a relationship exists between bulk density and microstructure, bulk density being higher in soils with a coarse monic c/f-related distribution pattern, intermediate in soils with enaulic c/f-related distribution pattern and granular microstructures and lowest in soils with a blocky microstructure.

# 3. Groundmass

# 3.1 Coarse Material

# 3.1.1 Identification of Components

Many soil scientists still use local or obsolete terms, although an internationally adopted terminology is available (Schmid, 1981; Fisher & Schmincke, 1984a; Le Maitre et al., 2002). For our purpose the following criteria can be used to characterise pyroclasts: (i) grain size, (ii) vesicularity, (iii) crystallinity and texture, and (iv) chemical composition. The subdivision according to grain size is summarised in Table 1. Mainly grains smaller than  $63\mathrm{mm}$  are of interest for microscopic studies. Subdivisions based on crystallinity and porosity are summarised in Table 2. Because the determination of the petrographic composition of volcanic rocks requires full mineralogical analyses for holocrystalline materials (see also Stoops & Mees, 2018), and chemical analyses for hypocrystalline and vitric materials, its discussion is beyond the scope of this chapter.

The identification and quantification of volcanic glass is of special importance for soil classification and genetic studies. Unaltered glass particles are optically isotropic. Si-rich volcanic glass (saturated, acid, rhyolitic) is colourless and has a negative optical relief  $(n < 1.54)$ . Si-poor glass (neutral or basic, undersaturated, sideromelane) is darker and has a positive relief (see Fig. 1A). Tachylyte is a very dark variety of basaltic glass, opaque in thin sections (Fig. 2C). The shape of glass particles is very characteristic: they usually have an irregular outline with sharp angles and cavities in the form of 'embayments'. They can be highly porous, sometimes with a fibrous aspect, forming pumice (rhyolitic glass) (see Figs. 4B, and 6A and B), or scoria (basaltic glass) (see Fig. 7).

A micromorphometric study of pumice gravel on the Canary Islands illustrates the large external surface  $(10.7\mathrm{cm}^2\mathrm{cm}^{-3})$  and the even larger internal surface area  $(25.0\mathrm{cm}^2\mathrm{cm}^{-3})$  of this material (Kress-Voltz, 1964, 1967). Glass can also be present as a component of rock fragments and as inclusions in volcanic minerals (Fig. 2A and B), or it can form coatings that cover those constituents. These features should be taken into

account when quantifying volcanic glass and they are useful indicators of a volcanic origin of the coarse material in other soils.

A notable feature of many Andosols and other soils on volcanic ash is the high concentration of phytoliths in the silt fraction (e.g., Stoops, 1983; Chartres et al., 1985; Poetsch & Arikas, 1997; Stoops et al., 2007) (Fig. 2D) (see also Gutierrez-Castorena & Effland, 2010; Gutierrez-Castorena, 2018). They can account for  $15\%$  and more of the coarse silt fraction (Sedov et al., 2003a; Fehér et al., 2007), whereas in most other soil types they are below  $1 - 2\%$ , even in the topsoil (Kamanina, 1997). Phytoliths are the dominant component of the coarse fraction of soils on volcanic ash in Veracruz (Mexico) (Dubroeucq et al., 2002). High quantities of highly weatherable silicium-rich components, especially volcanic glass, probably liberate high concentrations of Si in the soil solution, providing a higher uptake of Si by plants and protecting phytoliths already present from dissolution (Vallejo Gomez et al., 2000). Their identification and quantification is not easy, as acid glass and phytoliths have similar optical properties. Moreover, the shape of volcanic glass particles often resembles that of phytoliths (e.g., Van Ranst et al. 2011). If microprobe analyses are not available, a reliable discrimination between these two components can be done by immersion of the separated sand and silt fractions in glycerine. This liquid has a refractive index of 1.48, which is higher than the maximum for phytoliths (1.47) (Piperno, 1988) and lower than the minimum for Si-rich glass (1.49) (Shoji et al., 1993). Checking whether the Becke line moves in or out the grain when the microscope tube is raised allows distinguishing between both materials in glycerine grain mounts.

# 3.1.2 Alteration Before Pedogenesis

Some pyroclasts show signs of alteration by hydrothermal, pneumatolitic and subaqueous processes, which frequently accompany volcanic eruptions and may affect pyroclasts before they are involved in pedogenesis. The products of this alteration are variable; a few important examples will be discussed below.

Feldspars sometimes enclose fine-grained muscovite or paragonite (sericite), which is liberated during further weathering, adding illitic material to the micromass. Fe-Mg silicates are often transformed to chlorite and/or smectite. Especially in andesitic and basaltic rock fragments, chloritic alteration products are commonly found (Fig. 3A). They form coatings and/or infillings of vacuoles, sometimes in combination with zeolites and/ or carbonates. These chlorites can be a starting material for the later formation of 2:1 clay minerals, including smectites and vermiculites, in the regolith and the soil. Olivine is frequently altered, partially or totally, to IDDingsite pseudomorphs, following a pellicular or irregular linear pattern. Although IDDingsite behaves optically as a single crystal (yellowish- or reddish-brown, weakly pleochroic), it is in fact a mixture of cryptocrystalline goethite with phyllosilicates, such as smectite, chlorite, talc or mica (Delvigne et al., 1979).

Glass of pyroclastic ejecta derived from intermediate and Si-rich magmas is mostly transformed into clay minerals (cf. bentonite formation at a macroscopic scale).

Opalisation is restricted to very specific settings. Hydrothermal alteration of rhyolitic glass leads to its devitrification, forming fine-grained quartz, feldspar and cristobalite, resulting in optical anisotropy. In the case of acid sulphate hydrothermal alteration, kaolinite is formed as well (Wilson et al., 1997). Palagonite is the primary alteration product of sideromelane, formed by an interaction at ambient temperature with aqueous solutions (Fisher & Schmincke, 1984b; Stroncik & Schmincke, 2002). In thin sections it has a yellow, orange or reddish brown colour and refractive indices mostly below 1.54, diminishing with increasing water content. Two main palagonite varieties are recognised: (i) gel-palagonite, which is optically isotropic and usually crystal-free and concentrically banded (Fig. 3B), and (ii) fibro-palagonite, which is slightly to strongly optically anisotropic and either fibrous or granular in structure. Palagonite contains secondary minerals, including different kinds of clays (mainly smectites), zeolites, carbonate minerals, opal and Fe oxides. During the palagonitisation process some chemical elements are leached out, while others show relative gains, reflected by either a decrease or an increase of the refractive index of the alteromorph. Allophanic palagonite-like alteromorphs have been identified in volcanic soils by Gérard et al. (2007) (see also Section 3.1.4 and Section 5.2).

Correct identification of these alteration products is important for understanding the subsequent mineral transformations in soils. Hydrothermal phyllosilicates occurring as inclusions, being liberated from their 'host' volcanogenic minerals by weathering, could be a source of clay components for the soil fine material (Jongmans et al., 1994a, 1999; Sedov & Shoba, 1994).

# 3.1.3 Sedimentary Features

Tephra differ from many other parent materials not only by their mineralogical composition, but also by their layering, resulting from periodic ash deposition. This deposition

sequence can be formed during a single eruption cycle, or as a result of eruptions separated in time. In the latter case pedogenesis may have influenced the older material. Profiles can therefore comprise several ash deposits, affected by successive phases of weathering, which greatly complicates the study of pedogenesis (Dalrymple, 1964).

A typical aspect of the soils from Iceland is the preservation of a fine microstratification (millimetre- to centimetre-sized), recognisable by differences in composition (e.g., light versus dark basaltic glass, mineral and organic constituents) or in grain size distribution (Simpson et al., 1999; Milek, 2006; Stoops et al., 2008). Elongated organ residues show a parallel, (sub)horizontal arrangement (Fig. 4A), alternating with thin ash layers, pointing to gradual sedimentation and very limited pedoturbation, especially bioturbation (Stoops et al., 2008). Similar characteristics were observed for volcanic ash soils under coniferous forests in a cool boreal climate (Shoba et al., 2004).

Rejuvenation of older soils by addition of younger ash fall is a common phenomenon in areas of active volcanism. It can be recognised by the presence of less-weathered coarse components in a more strongly weathered groundmass. Examples include the presence of fresh pumice fragments in a strongly weathered soil on andesite (Fig. 4B) (Fauzi & Stoops, 2004) and the occurrence of fresh minerals derived from a recent eruption in the surface horizon of an Andosol (Jongmans et al., 1994b). In extreme cases this can result in the so-called inverted weathering profiles, where soil material is less weathered at the top than at the bottom (Rodriguez-Rodriguez et al., 1988; Bakker et al., 1996; Solleiro-Rebolledo et al., 2003). Recent deposition of light-coloured acid ash can form a pale upper horizon, resembling an albic horizon.

In lower parts of the landscape or in depressions, accumulation of layers of colluvial volcanic material interrupted by cycles of pedogenesis can occur (e.g., Sauer & Zoller, 2006).

A special case are tephra-rich tsunami deposits, but information on their micromorphological characteristics is scarce. Some macroscopic and microscopic features have been described for tsunami deposits originating from the Santorini eruption in Greece, including the presence of reworked fragments of building stones and ceramics, marine shells and microfauna remains, as well as a multimodal chaotic fabric, and especially in thin sections, a sharp contact between fresh ash and soil-derived red-brown sediments (Bruins et al., 2008).

# 3.1.4 Evolution in Soils

In very weakly developed soils (Regosols), the coarse material shows practically no weathering in thin sections. The main alteration agents during the first stages of weathering of tephra are various species of lichens by excreting organic acids and by trapping dust and weathering products (Vingiani et al., 2013). Most of these components and organic matter were accumulated in the vacuoles of tephra fragments and gradually built a substrate for fungi or plants.

In Andosols, the coarse material mainly consists of weatherable volcanogenic minerals such as plagioclase, olivine, pyroxenes, oxi-hornblende, volcanic glass and opaque minerals (magnetite, ilmenite), as well as volcanic rock fragments. This material commonly shows evidence of weathering, ranging from superficial etching to partial dissolution (Fig. 5A), total congruent dissolution (e.g., hypersthene) or replacement by alteration products (Fig. 5C and D). Although olivine is considered to be more easily weathered than pyroxenes, the latter are often less resistant because of their prominent cleavage (Stoops, 2013). Olivine is often altered to iddingsite, which is a mixture of goethite and phyllosilicates (see Section 3.1.2). Iddingsite is very stable in soils and is often the only remaining lithogenic mineral, apart from inherited Fe or Fe-Ti oxides, that is observed for the most highly weathered Andosols (Fig. 5E and F) (Stoops, 2013). The most resistant minerals, especially in andesitic and basaltic tephra, are magnetite and/or ilmenite (e.g., Schwaighofer, 1976). The original position of tephra fragments that are completely weathered is often marked by clusters of these residual opaque minerals (Chartres et al., 1985; Jongmans et al., 1991). Increased fragmentation of vitreous material from bottom to top of the soils has been noticed (Bech-Borras et al., 1977).

In submarine volcanic glass, fine tubular microcavities that are a few micrometres wide and up to several hundred micrometres long can form by the action of hyphae and/or bacteria (Staudigel et al., 2008; McLoughlin et al., 2010). This pattern of alteration is not yet reported in published soil studies, because nobody looked for it, but it was observed for a Viking grave site on Iceland (Burns, pers. comm., 2016). Fission tracks and alpha ray recoil trails are a magnitude smaller than these biogenic features.

Weathering of small basalt fragments in the solum is often different from that of the underlying massive basalt substrate (Stoops, 1972). Leaching in the open soil system is stronger than in the less open saprolite system, resulting for instance in gibbsite formation.

Sideromelane often weathers to a palagonite-like allophane alteromorph (Gérard et al., 2007) (see also Section 2.2.2). This material is characterised by a yellow, orange or orange-red colour (Figs. 1D, 3B and 5B), a negative relief, and often by the presence of concentric rings with slightly different refractive indices. Energy-dispersive microanalysis indicates a total loss of alkaline and alkaline earth elements, together with hydration. This type of pedogenic weathering has not been recognised in earlier studies, although some authors have previously postulated that palagonite-like substances in soils could be weathering products (Bech-Borras et al., 1977; Paluskova, 1988). As these alteromorphs quickly disintegrate (Rodríguez-Rodríguez et al., 1980a, 1980b), many Andosols containing basaltic vitric tephra are characterised by abundant yellow or orange fragments in the coarse fraction (Stoops, 2013). As described by Gebhardt et al. (1969), weathering of trachytic glass ( $n = 1.510$ ) starts with a brownish allophane coating ( $n = 1.600$ ), in contact with the sides of the glass particle, followed by weathering of the glass to kaolinite ( $n = 1.557$ ) beneath the allophane coating. As weathering continues, kaolinite also forms within the vacuoles, and finally a complete kaolinitic alteromorph is formed. A similar sequence was observed by Ivanov et al. (2014), documented by EDS analysis of coatings on sand-sized volcanic glass particles in B horizons of associated Andosols and Podzols on the Commanders Islands. The inner coating was composed of allophane, ferrihydrite and organic matter, whereas organic matter was dominant over allophane in the middle coating and iron oxides were dominant in the outer coating, confirming the similarity between the studied Andosols and Podzols in terms of pedogenesis. Coatings have also been described for rhyolitic glass shards from the C horizon of Vitric Andosols in Veracruz, Mexico. The composition of these isotropic, limpid, non-laminated coatings was close to that of glass in deeper parts of the profile, becoming less Si-rich in higher parts (Dubroeucq et al., 1998).

Admixture of non-volcanic components due to aeolian or colluvial input is possible, and sometimes important (e.g., von Suchodoletz et al., 2009). Few data are available on differences in micromorphological characteristics between different Andosols. Tejedor Salguero et al. (1975, 1978, 1979) mentioned an increased weathering of the coarse material from Vitrandepts to Eustrandepts and further to Dystrandepts (Soil Survey Staff, 1975).

Although the formation of a Bt horizon is associated with a more advanced degree of weathering and many volcanogenic materials (especially volcanic glass) are already destroyed, the coarse material of soils with an argic horizon in many cases still contain silicates of volcanic origin, such as plagioclase and pyroxenes, as well as pyroclasts. The mineral grains and rock fragments are usually altered; sometimes illuvial clay invades the cracks and etch pits. Various types of alteromorphs are observed, in particular complete halloysite pseudomorphs after porous volcanic glass in Mexico (Sedov, unpublished data).

In Ferralsols of the Canary Islands the coarse material is strongly weathered and often only fragments impregnated by iron oxides remain visible. Volcanic glass alters in well-aerated conditions to a yellowish isotropic product with many fissures, followed by an

intense rubification starting from the sides of the vacuoles, giving rise to dark red optically isotropic alteromorphs which are readily fragmented by pedoturbation (Rodriguez-Rodriguez et al., 1980b). Euhedral magnetite grains are commonly present throughout the profile (Schwaighofer, 1976; Rodriguez-Rodriguez et al., 1980a; Tejedor Salguero et al., 1984/1985). When all other minerals are dissolved, this can give a characteristic dotted aspect to strongly weathered soils on pyroclastic material, basalt or dolerite (Stoops, 2013). It is responsible for the unexpected high values of oxalate extractable iron, often exceeding the DCB-extractable iron (e.g., Algoe et al., 2012).

Coarse material of soils with duric horizon such as tepetate consists of angular to weakly rounded grains of volcanogenic minerals and often volcanic glass (Alfaro Sánchez et al., 1992). In most cases their weathering status is low except for horizons in more developed soils or palaeosols (e.g., Rhodic Luvisols). Sometimes phytoliths are so abundant that they become one of the dominant components of the silt fraction (Solleiro-Rebolledo et al., 2003).

# 3.2 Micromass

The origin of the micromass of soils developed on volcanic material still needs further study. It can be part of the original tephra or derived from in situ weathering of the coarse fraction (e.g., Van Ranst et al., 2008). It can also be of aeolian origin, as suggested by the presence of non-volcanic components, such as fine muscovite flakes (e.g., Rodríguez-Rodríguez et al., 1988; Jahn et al., 1992). Also the liberation of hydrothermal phyllosilicates from their 'host' volcanogenic minerals by weathering could be a source of fine material (Jongmans et al., 1994a; Sedov & Shoba, 1994), as mentioned before.

In regoliths and Regosols, fine material is very rare and displays an undifferentiated b-fabric. It occurs as coatings on the coarse mineral grains (Sokolov, 1972; Schwaighofer, 1976; Bertrand & Fagell, 2008) (Figs. 1B and 6A). Internal hypocoatings of micromass

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/cfbe1b43-f1a3-484d-87d6-737ed12321a7/ac74f6977bc12a6a1c60e9a902969cbfac8eeaace0ce081745f6646ad971a0b8.jpg)

within pumice fragments, along their sides, were observed by Stoops et al. (2006), Colombo et al. (2007), Stoops (2007) and Stoops and Gerard (2007) (Fig. 6). These internal hypocoatings form by intrusion of micromass in near-surface vacuoles of the fragments (Fig. 6B). Weathering probably contributes to the opening of these vacuoles. Moreover, fine roots often penetrate in the pores of the pumice fragments, where nutrients are available (Sanborn, 2010). The presence of micromass coatings and internal hypocoatings is of great importance for the evaluation of the fertility of these soils, as they mainly occur on rock fragments that are larger than the fine earth fraction and therefore are removed for routine physicochemical analyses, leading to wrong information on the composition and fertility of the soil. The coatings of fine material should not be mistaken for those that form around rock fragments during the eruption (called armed pyroclasts by petrographers, aggregates of coarse ash surrounded by much finer ash) and are preserved during soil formation (Colombo et al., 2007). Similar micromass coatings are observed for non-volcanic soils subject to frost phenomena and explained as stress features (see Van Vliet-Lanoë, 2010; Van Vliet-Lanoë & Fox, 2018).

In Andosols, the micromass generally has an undifferentiated b-fabric, as already stated by Kawai (1969), because of the predominance of amorphous or cryptocrystalline colloidal components (allophane, imogolite, ferrihydrite). Pain (1971) proposed to use an undifferentiated b-fabric as a criterion for the recognition of volcanic ash parent material. The submicroscopic structure of these components is at nanometre scale and is usually studied with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (e.g., Dubroeucq et al., 2002). Variable quantities of dark humus pigment are present in the fine material. Humus forms very stable complexes with allophanes and persists in buried Andosols of Pleistocene age (Sedov et al., 2003a). The Bw horizons of Andosols have higher clay content than the A horizons and sometimes contain rounded aggregates of different colour, pointing to a colluvial origin (derived from erosion of more evolved soils) rather than pedogenesis in situ (Stoops, 2007). Also Paluskova (1988) mentioned the frequent presence of rounded polymictic aggregates in fossil soil sediments on Santorini.

In intergrades to more evolved soils, some areas inside blocky peds are depleted of humus pigment (Sedov et al., 2003b). In soils where allophane is gradually replaced by crystalline clays, the micromass generally presents an undifferentiated b-fabric, even when halloysite is abundant, but stipple-speckled b-fabrics have been described for soils containing kaolinite or illite (e.g., Remmelzwaal, 1978; Fernandez-Caldas et al., 1982; Malucelli et al., 1999). A transition of undifferentiated b-fabric in granular allophanic horizons to speckled b-fabric in more weathered blocky material has been described for soils on ash near Pompeii, Italy (Vogel et al., 2016). A similar evolution from undifferentiated to speckled and even weakly striated b-fabric was observed for a chronosequence on Papua New Guinea (Chartres et al., 1985). The b-fabric was more developed with depth, which was attributed to an increase in cryptocrystalline gibbsite in the clay fraction, as confirmed by XRD analysis. The lack of striated b-fabric was explained by the absence of frequent cycles of wetting and drying (Chartres et al, 1985).

In Ferralsols, the b-fabric becomes generally stipple-speckled to weakly striated in a first stage, but finally changes again to undifferentiated, with a cloudy limpidity, typical for oxic or ferralic materials (Rodríguez-Rodriguez et al., 1988; West et al., 1997; see also Marcelino et al., 2010, 2018).

Vertisols derived from volcanic materials can show striated b-fabrics (e.g., Rodriguez Hernandez et al., 1979; Yerima et al., 1987).

Arid soils on andesitic material in southern Spain show striated b-fabrics, together with clay coatings, considered as features inherited from a more humid climate (Aguilar & Delgado, 1974). Calcitic crystallitic b-fabrics have also been observed (Stoops, 1980; Zarei et al., 1997).

The fine material of soils with duric horizon has a variable b-fabric. It is usually undifferentiated or stipple-speckled, sometimes poro- and granostriated (Alfaro Sánchez et al., 1992).

SEM images of fracture surfaces show that the micromass of allophane-rich soils consists of aggregates of small  $(5 - 500\mu \mathrm{m})$  globules, in which allophane seems to encapsulate other clay minerals present, whereas the micromass of halloysitic soil materials consists of randomly oriented tubules (Eswaran, 1983).

# 4. Organic Material

A common feature of most soils on volcanic ash, especially Andosols, is the abundance of fungal hyphae and sklerotia (Fig. 7). They are responsible for a specific humus component, rich in chitine-derived substances (Nierop & Buurman, 2007).

In Regosols, the type and abundance of organic material is mainly determined by climate. It ranges from occurrences of a few roots and hyphae in the dry soils of Santorini (Stoops et al., 2006, 2007; Stoops & Gérard, 2007) to abundant coarse plant residues and fungal hyphae at  $4500\mathrm{m}$  altitude on the Orizaba volcano (Mexico) (Dubroeucq et al., 2002). In the latter example, this is combined with high activity of the mesofauna, as shown by the large excrements containing both organic and mineral fragments. Abundant faunal excrements were also observed for alpine meadow soils of Mexican volcanic highlands (Dubroeucq et al., 2002). A close association between fine roots and pumice grains has been observed, whereby root development appears to be favoured by the vesicular fabric of the grains and their capacity to retain water (De León Gonzales et al., 2007; Sanborn, 2010).

Within the spectrum of climates suitable for Andosol formation, higher humidity is observed to cause greater humus accumulation (Quantin, 1985; Miehlich, 1991), resulting in stronger staining of the fine material with dark humus pigment.

In cool boreal climates under coniferous forest, fragments of partially decomposed plant tissues (raw humus), as well as fungal mycelia, are abundant in the surface horizon, whereas dark organic pigment (colloidal humus) is limited (Shoba et al., 2004). Signs of faunal activity, such as excrements and litter fragmentation, are very scarce.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/cfbe1b43-f1a3-484d-87d6-737ed12321a7/d81c2e6932130ef24d788798163133302df4b7a953f8a63556f1abe75a1e0079.jpg)  
FIGURE 7 Charcoal fragments and sideromelane (s) scoria in Andosol (Tenerife, Canary Islands) (PPL). Note the presence of fungal hyphae (h) in the right lower corner.

Fragments of organ and tissue residues are rather few and found mostly in the surface horizon of Andosols. Charcoal particles are common, not only in the topsoil, but also throughout the profile, including the C horizon (Fig. 7). They originate from the burning of vegetation, which is quite common in regions with volcanic activity.

Frei (1964) stated that fine organic matter coats all coarse grains in Andosols of Ecuador. Humification of organic material is the least advanced in Vitrandepts, compared to Eustrandepts and Dystrandepts (Soil Survey Staff, 1975), and the former also contain numerous fungal hyphae and sklerotia (Tejedor Salguero et al., 1975, 1978, 1979). Dubroeucq et al. (2002) described the presence of organic gel-like substances in the lower part of Andosols on the Mexican highlands, which they considered to be a result of lateral downslope movements. Andosols in the humid tropics have in general a darker and more abundant micromass than in temperate soils, as well as abundant fungal hyphae and phytoliths (Stoops, unpublished data).

# 5. Pedofeatures

# 5.1 Illuvial Clay Coatings

Coatings and infillings evidencing illuviation of fine colloidal materials are usually not present, as the major part of the nanocrystalline fine material is coagulated and fixed in rather stable granular aggregates.

In Andosols intermediate to soils with crystalline clays, few (much less than  $1\%$ ) but clear thin depositional clay coatings are located mostly in channels, but also on walls of

planar voids and even in packing voids within areas with a granular structure of the Ah horizon (Sedov et al., 2003b). The coatings are optically isotropic or anisotropic with very low interference colours and mostly without lamination. Their colour varies from yellow to bright brown due to colouration by organic pigments or iron oxides.

Illuvial coatings composed of a mixture of clay and silt, as observed for soils of Tenerife, Canary Islands, are probably related to rapid melting of snow along exposed slopes (Benayas et al., 1974). Strong illuviation, up to  $25\%$  by volume, was noticed for Luvisols of the Canary Islands with preservation of a granular microstructure  $(500 - 1000\mu \mathrm{m})$  (Rodriguez-Rodriguez et al., 1979, 1980a). For a soil chronosequence formed on Late Quaternary rhyolite tephra, Bakker et al. (1996) reported abundant pumice fragments and low clay contents for the youngest soils, and clay illuviation, clay formation, gleying and a high degree of weathering of primary minerals in the other end-member. Jongmans et al. (1991), studying soil formation on terraces containing volcanic components, concluded that the development of textural pedofeatures (and striated b-fabrics) occurs in soils on terraces that are at least 0.5 million years old. In general, phytoliths are rather frequent in the coarse material of these Bt horizons, in contrast with illuvial horizons on non-volcanic parent rocks. As the majority of phytoliths occurs dispersed in the groundmass and not as part of the illuvial features, they are not accumulated in the Bt horizon by illuviation process. Both the granular aggregates and phytoliths are probably relic features, inherited from an earlier stage.

Illuvial coatings of oriented clay were also described by Stoops (1972) and Goenadi and Tan (1989) for Ultisols on volcanic tephra (Fig. 8A and B). Also soils with duric horizon may contain clay coatings (Oleschko, 1990; Oleschko et al., 1992; Fig. 8C). One example are thick clay coatings composed of halloysite and cristobalite, with higher cristobalite content in the indurated zones (Dubroeucq, 1991). Coatings and infillings of impure clay with poor orientation and abundant silt particles are supposed to be generated by overland flows with a high concentration of suspended matter, associated with Pleistocene eruptions. In these cases, induration may result from structure collapse following water saturation, together with sedimentation from the surface flow (Solleiro-Rebolledo et al., 2003).

# 5.2 Authigenic Clay Coatings

Already in the initial stage of weathering of volcanic glass, thin isotropic coatings are formed around glass fragments (see Section 3.1.4). Nanocrystalline Si-Al-rich coatings and infillings have been described for Andosols of humid tropical regions (Jongmans et al., 1994b, 1995). They are colourless, optically isotropic and non-laminated in unweathered rock fragments, becoming microlaminated and stained by Fe oxides in higher parts of the profile. These coatings and infillings are considered to be the product of in situ coprecipitation of Al and Si, forming allophane. They are subsequently transformed by desilicification, initially near the voids, first to imogolite (SEM-EDS analysis) and later to very fine-grained gibbsite, giving the coatings a slightly anisotropic aspect in XPL.

Jongmans et al. (1996) reported coatings in surface horizons on slopes of active volcanoes, consisting of a mixture of secondary opal-A and ash particles of different sizes. These workers concluded that the formation of such coatings is a common but transient phenomenon under strongly acidic environmental conditions that favour rapid weathering. Absence of a vegetation cover and of fresh ash additions are prerequisites for their formation.

Isotropic coatings, observed for the lower part of the profiles of some Andosols from Costa Rica, are thought to develop by formation of allophane from dissolved Si and Al present in percolating soil solutions (Jongmans et al., 1995).

In Podzols on coarse volcanic material, pale yellow coatings of isotropic clay occur in deeper parts of the Bw horizon (De Coninck & Rijkse, 1986).

For palaeosols (Luvisols) of the Allier terraces (France), Jongmans et al. (1994c) described coatings that are partly optically isotropic and partly anisotropic, formed by in situ precipitation of allophane, which subsequently transforms to unoriented smectitic clays.

Similar observations were made by Gérard et al. (2007) for modern soils. The rather low interference colours and occasional optical isotropism of clay components both in the groundmass and in the pedofeatures is related to the presence of nanocrystalline components, the relatively low birefringence of minerals of the kaolinite group and, in case of halloysite dominance, the tubular or globular particle shape that does not promote formation of oriented (face-to-face) clay domains. Optically isotropic clay coatings in soils with an optically isotropic groundmass were also considered diagnostic of volcanic ash parent material by Dalrymple (1964).

Limpid, colourless, optically isotropic coatings, overlying smectitic clay coatings were reported for a Hapludult (Stoops, 1972, 2013; Eswaran et al., 1973), illustrating the polygenetic character of the soil due to later ashfalls (Fig. 8A and B). Optically isotropic clay coatings in Ferralsols on Java, showing anisotropic zones, were considered by Buurman & Jongmans (1987) as in situ precipitated allophane coatings recrystallising under the influence of desiccation to halloysite, or formed as a result of more recent ashfall.

Poetsch and Arikas (1997) and Poetsch (2004), using phase contrast microscopy for sections thinner than the standard thickness  $(20 - 30\mu \mathrm{m})$ , could identify opaline films juxtaposed on clay coatings in some indurated horizons. A similar observation was reported by Creutzberg et al. (1990). Some authors (Dubroeucq, 1992; Hidalgo et al., 1992) stated that the amorphous silica is closely associated with halloysite particles in the micromass and clay pedofeatures of these soils. It cannot be distinguished by optical methods and should be studied by means of electron microscopy and selective extractions.

# 5.3 Other Pedofeatures

For Andosols of the alpine meadows of tropical highlands, Dubroeucq et al. (2002) described dark organic coatings in channels in the lower part of the profile. The authors attributed this feature to the vertical and lateral migration of organic gels together with silica and allophane during the rainy season.

Nieuwenhuyse et al. (1993) mentioned the presence of iron oxide hypocoatings in Haplaquands. They were also observed for paddy soils from the Philippines (Stoops, 1984).

Rounded grains of opal or allophane-opal (50-700  $\mu$ m, exceptionally  $1600\mu \mathrm{m}$ ) were described by von Buch (1967). The grains are clear or turbid, white or yellowish, with very low stress interference colours and a flow fabric. The refractive index ranges from 1.40 to 1.48. They are probably derived from the fragmentation of opaline coatings and infillings as they are soft in the lower horizons and become hard toward the surface. Similar features are frequently observed in thin sections of volcanic ash soils (Stoops, 2013). Another type of fragments are sand- and silt-sized composite particles consisting of mineral fragments, phytoliths and groundmass material cemented by hard allophane-like material, which are supposed to have formed irreversibly during dry periods

(Riezebos & Lustenhouwer, 1983). These granules are not destroyed during grain size analysis and behave as coherent particles during erosion.

Coatings and nodules of fine-grained gibbsite are observed under conditions of strong leaching (Kawai, 1969), especially in the middle and the lower part of profiles (Stoops, 1972; Eswaran et al., 1973; Morras, 1976).

Infillings with granular aggregates in ant galleries and fungus chambers were described by Eschenbrenner (1994).

Only limited information is available on the presence of placic horizons in soils on volcanic ash. Pinheiro & Rodríguez-Rodríguez (1994) and Pinheiro et al. (2004) described placic horizons occurring in Placudands and Placaquands (Soil Survey Staff, 2014) of the Terceira Island (Azores). The groundmass consists of pyroclasts and a brownish, speckled or limpid clay with an undifferentiated b-fabric, resulting in a chitonic or enaulic c/f-related distribution pattern. The placic horizon is formed by a superposition of a red to dark red, rather limpid, optically isotropic, locally globular material, forming a dense porphyric layer with a lamellar fabric on top, and a diffuse transition to the lower parts (see also Wilson & Righi, 2010; Van Ranst et al., 2018).

In duric horizons on volcanic ash, various pedofeatures can be present, depending on the pedogenic environment. Besides clay coatings (Fig. 8C), they include ferruginous nodules in more humid soil types (Solleiro-Rebolledo et al., 2003) and carbonates in drier areas (Fedoroff et al., 1994), as well as components derived from palaeosols such as fragments of Bt horizons or fragments of clay coatings. Some of these features contribute to the cementation of the horizon (Quantin, 1992).

Horizons beneath stratified litter in Kamchatka show a combination of features, typical for Andosols and for the spodic horizon of Podzols (Shoba et al., 2004). Pyroclastic grains are covered by thick optically isotropic micromass coatings with a bright yellow-brown colour, often dissected by a network of desiccation fissures that are clearly seen in SEM images (Fig. 8D). Compound coatings of allophane and organic matter surrounding volcanic ash grains were observed by Ivanov et al. (2014) (see Section 3.1.4). For the Bs horizons of Podzols on coarse materials in New Zealand, De Coninck and Rijkse (1986) observed aggregates of loosely packed pumice fragments and fine pellets to coexist with loose infillings and denser aggregates with a yellowish micromass, coated by monomorphic organic material. The authors concluded that the pellets are the result of local decomposition of the root system.

In a calcic Gypsiorthid described by Stoops (1980 and unpublished data), calcite penetrates in the vacuoles of the pyroclasts. Several of these pyroclasts show remains of limpid, yellowish, optically anisotropic coatings of strongly oriented clay, pointing to an earlier phase of pedogenesis under different conditions, whereas calcite pendants result from present-day soil formation. Sauer and Zoller (2006) described orthic, disorthic and anorthic micritic carbonate nodules for a complex profile on Lanzarote (Canary Islands). The morphology of calcic and petrocalcic horizons in arid soils on volcanic ash is similar to that of these horizons in soils on other parent materials (Jahn et al., 1985; Jahn & Stahr, 1994).

# 6. Conclusions

Studies of topo-, chrono- and climasequences of soils on volcanic ash (e.g., Stoops, 1972; Fernández-Caldas et al., 1982; Chartres et al., 1985; Dubroeucq et al., 1998; Stoops, 2013) clearly show a general trend: already in an early stage of pedogenesis a granular microstructure develops, and this persists until a blocky microstructure appears in more developed soils (e.g., Luvisols). The amount of mineral grains and glass particles that were part of the parent material rapidly diminishes till onlyIDDingsite, magnetite and/or ilmenite remain in andesitic or basaltic tephra. The b-fabric is undifferentiated and evolves only slowly to weakly speckled in more developed soils. This evolution seems to occur more or less in parallel with an evolution of allophane to halloysite, and subsequently to cryptocrystalline gibbsite. Striated b-fabrics only form when hydromorphic conditions interfere. As stated by Chesworth (1973), all materials evolve to a residual system, and time nullifies the influence of parent materials. From a micromorphological point of view, not all fabric elements of the parent material or early alteration stages seem to be obliterated, as for instance b-fabric remains undifferentiated or weakly speckled as long as no hydromorphism occurs.

The literature contain many examples of the use of chemical and/or physical methods to disentangle the complex geological and pedological history of a profile by for instance differences in grain size and trace element content (Buurman et al., 2004). Also mineralogical studies of the coarse fraction, using grain mounts, are commonly used for this purpose. Interdisciplinary studies (Arnalds et al., 2007) show that in most cases micromorphological investigations yield the clearest results. Compared to grain mount studies, thin sections have the advantage that minerals and rock fragments of medium and coarse sand size can be identified and that even larger grains can be studied (Stoops & Van Driessche, 2007).

In studies of volcanic materials little effort has been made to distinguish materials derived from direct ashfall and those transported and recycled by aeolian activity, colluvial processes (e.g., lahar formation) or tsunamis. In addition, it is not always clear whether the described soils developed on tephra or on lava flows. A major contribution of micromorphology has been to clarify the complexities of accumulation patterns, including occurrences of standstill phases (accumulation of organic matter and phytoliths), water-born sedimentation and aeolian deposition.

Insufficient attention has been given to vertical petrographic heterogeneity when studying pedogenesis in soils on volcanic ash. In some cases the fabric of Bw horizons seems to be the result of colluvial input derived from more developed soils, rather than the result of a pedogenic process (Stoops, 2007). This is not necessarily detected by other research methods, such as chemical and mineralogical analyses.

Information on soils on volcanic ash in arid environments is very limited, apart from some data for palaeosols. More research is necessary.

Several issues related to the micromorphology of soils formed on volcanic material have still to be clarified. The most prominent questions are (i) whether the origin of the

typical granular microstructure is related to biological activity or physicochemical processes, or both; (ii) whether fine material that appears during early stages of soil development formed in situ by weathering or fragmentation, or whether it represents an aeolian input; (iii) whether differences exist between the micromorphological characteristics of allophanic Andosols (dominated by non-crystalline Al silicates) and non-allophanic Andosols (dominated by organometallic complexes, e.g., on shales); and (iv) to what extent lateral translocation of materials between pedons is important, as suggested by Chen et al. (1999).

# 1. Introduction

Humans have had an influence on pedogenic processes to a varying extent throughout the world, either through direct intervention or by indirect, long-range, action. Examples of direct interventions include disturbance of soil by tillage, management of standing vegetation using fire and addition of manures. Such interventions may be both intensive and rapid. In contrast, indirect human actions include long-term changes to vegetation and land cover, human-induced atmospheric changes affecting aerosol depositions to soils and human-induced climate changes altering biological, chemical and physical soil processes. These indirect actions are cumulative and long term in their impact on soils and regoliths. The understanding that the nature of the impact of these direct and indirect actions on soils can be recognised has led to debate about the role of soil use in the geological concept of the Anthropocene, as defined by Crutzen (2002). Some authors consider anthropogenic soils as a possible marker for the onset of this period (Certini & Scalenghe, 2011), with direct human actions on soils forming part of the wider debate about how to rationalise a definition of the Anthropocene as a geological epoch (Waters et al., 2014).

The role of humans as a factor in soil formation has been considered in many soil classification exercises (Bidwell & Hole, 1965; Bridges, 1978; Amundsen & Jenny, 1991; Dudal et al., 2002). In many of the major classification systems used today, a diverse set of anthropogenic influences have been considered during development of the classification but not always adopted. As a trend, direct human influences appear to be increasingly understood within the concept of soils as a key environmental resource (Bullock & Gregory, 1991) and, from this perspective, are now fully considered in soil classification systems (Dudal, 1990). Interest in urban soils has also been raised by the influential textbook by Fanning and Fanning (1989). Coupled with the growing recognition of anthropogenic impacts on agricultural soils, human impact has also become recognised for soils in urban environments (e.g., Schleuss et al., 1998), and urban soils are now defined in soil classification systems (Effland & Pouyat, 1997). Combined, this activity can be seen to have led to the development of definitions for Anthrosols and Technosols in the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (Nachtergaele, 2003; IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006, 2015).

A major question immediately raised in discussion of anthropogenic soil features is whether certain micromorphological features can be the result of anthropogenic influences or can be considered as natural. This problem has long been of concern in soil classification systems (Manil, 1959). In micromorphological studies, it has elicited discussion on the relative impact of individual factors of soil formation (Dalrymple, 1962) and on equifinality of processes acting in geoarchaeological contexts (Goldberg & Macphail, 2006). With this array of potential topics, and to set limits to what is considered 'anthropogenic', only those features that have arisen through direct human interventions are considered in this chapter.

Direct interventions are typically those related to agriculture through tillage, irrigation and addition of materials to increase soil fertility. Tillage encompasses all direct mechanical interventions that occur during agricultural cultivation processes. This includes surface disturbances through spade and hoe tillage by hand and by utilising a source of traction, ploughing, harrowing and rolling. Modern highly mechanised agricultural practices include subsoiling (deep-ripping) and mole draining, whereby the surface soil may remain relatively intact but may greatly modify soil porosity and related hydrological properties at depth. Primary tillage processes generally aim to loosen and mix the soil, whereas secondary tillage processes tend to shape plant beds and produce a finer soil structure. Spade cultivation varies markedly, and anthropological studies in the north Atlantic region (Fenton, 1970) have captured a remarkable variety of forms including the pronounced bed forms seen on the Faroe Islands (av Skaröi, 1970). In modern agricultural systems, tillage usually includes the repeated passage of machinery over the soil surface, and the compound effects of these actions therefore also need to be considered.

Many of these direct interventions can, therefore, be directly linked to the definitions of various diagnostic horizons of antherosols in soil classification systems. In the World Reference Base, these are (i) hortic horizons, formed through intensive fertilisation and/ or deep cultivation over a long period, (ii) irrigic and hydraulic horizons, formed by irrigation practices, (iii) plaggic horizons formed by addition of turfs over a long period, and (iv) terric horizons, formed by deposition of mineral materials (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015).

In modern urbanised environments, direct human interventions may be more pronounced, with soil properties conditioned by non-natural substrates such as metalliferous residues, in soils that are classified as Technosols (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015). With such soils, there is also a nuanced distinction between soils that are created and then left alone and those that are under continuous or regular impact through land management, typically the application of wastes. These soils may strongly contrast seminatural soils, as Technosols may be the result of repeated additions of mineral materials. Differences in porosity and infiltration have been reported for such soils (Paradelo & Barral, 2013).

Other direct interventions that can be recognised as anthropogenic features based on soil micromorphology include the practice of burning vegetation in situ as fire-clearance husbandry (see Steensberg, 1993), clearing standing vegetation for grazing (Mallik & FitzPatrick, 1996), clearance for settlement of forest areas (Arroyo-Kalin, 2010, 2012; Brancier et al., 2014) and addition of ash materials as fertiliser (Simpson et al., 2002; Adderley et al., 2006).

In developing better understandings of anthropogenic features, soil micromorphological studies have an increasing role to play by informing the debate on soil quality and landscape management (Mermut & Eswaran, 2001), as one of the several soil-based proxies allowing palaeoenvironmental reconstruction (Terwilliger et al., 2013) and studies on soils inherited by farming communities (Simpson, 1997). In doing so, a need

to understand differences in spatial or geographic distribution and between various anthropogenic practices across a range of geographic regions has become increasingly important. Coupled with these spatial elements, changes through time are likely to occur. This raises the possibility of different, or confounded, origins of discrete features. In considering anthropogenic features over time, there is an obvious link with studies of archaeological soil and sediment materials (Macphail & Goldberg, 2010, 2018) and buried soil horizons (Cremaschi et al., 2018). As such, these may be subject to additional forces other than typical soil-forming processes, both natural and anthropogenic.

The effects of anthropogenic interventions in soil development as recognised through soil micromorphology are dependent not only on the nature, intensity and duration of the intervention but also on the original properties of the soil. This makes identification of micromorphological features associated with specific anthropogenic processes particularly difficult and complex. To identify the imprint of a range of processes, understanding of past land use may become essential for establishing a secure interpretation. In approaching the interpretation of anthropogenic features found in soils and regoliths through conventional soil micromorphological techniques, a description of each set of diagnostic micromorphological features is required. Through comparative analysis ('differential diagnosis'; Kubiëna, 1970), individual anthropogenic processes can be recognised. Such an analysis should follow the general methodology established by Bullock et al. (1985) and updated by Stoops (2003).

# 2. Microstructure

# 2.1 Agricultural Soils

# 2.1.1 Tillage

The immediate effects of individual tillage operations on the soil are typically considered to be short-lived (Mackie-Dawson et al., 1989) and can be usefully considered separately from the more general effects of sustained periods of intensive cultivation. Such contrasts have been investigated in many different trials, typically utilising repeated mechanical intervention to monitor both its impact and the recovery from such impacts (Bottinelli et al., 2014). Typically, these studies have focussed on processes associated with compaction. The most obvious effect of compaction is a change in pore size and increased bulk density. Both Brewer (1964) and Greenland (1977) defined pore size classifications, and the latter associated pore size with soil water potential. Micromorphometric approaches using computer-based image analysis have been adopted to quantify porosity and water movement differences, as done in a key study by Bouma et al. (1979). More recently, Pagliai et al. (2003) have extended this approach to include shape criteria in the classification of macropores. The classifications proposed by Brewer, Greenland and Pagliai are all still commonly used for this purpose today.

Reported effects observed through conventional optical micromorphology analysis of tillage operations include an immediate increase in porosity, as well as groundmass

heterogeneity, associated with subsoiling (Grevers & de Jong, 1992), deep ploughing and mole drainage (Borchert, 1967) and the use of deep-ripping implements (Pagliai et al., 2004). Francis et al. (1988) found that the total porosity of ploughed soil increased but that this increase was dominated by unstable macropores. Borchert (1967) observed bridging between aggregates 4 years after cultivation. In general, total microporosity appears to remain unchanged or to decrease because of compaction caused by farm vehicle traffic (Servadio et al., 2005). After ploughing, a change in microporosity from vertical channels to planar voids has also been noted (Francis et al., 1988; Stoops et al., 1988; Lamande et al., 2003), but channels will next reappear (Mackie-Dawson et al., 1989). Aggregates in ploughed soils tend to be blocky or prismatic, as opposed to the crumb microstructure found in grassland soils.

Pedality may decrease in degree of development because of repeated tillage, to the point where soils may become apedal (Jongerius, 1983). The temporal framework of these studies is important, as the use of mechanised tillage practices over long periods typically shows a decrease in total porosity compared with the use of other land-use practices (Domžl et al., 1993). This may not be apparent in short-term experimental studies.

Tillage, particularly of clay-rich soils, can result in the development of compacted plough pans with a platy microstructure at, and below, the base of the Ap horizon, resulting from shear forces applied to soil constituents at the base of the plough layer (Jongerius, 1983; Pagliai et al., 2003). The texture of the soil will influence the relative strength of such plough pans, with weaker pan development in sandy soils (Kooistra et al., 1984).

The size and morphology of soil aggregates has been used as an indicator of tillage (Soares et al., 2005; Usai, 2005). It has been demonstrated experimentally that incorporation of exogenous organic materials has a significant effect on the stability of aggregates of different sizes (Six et al., 2004; Kristiansen et al., 2006). Therefore, interpretation of tillage must also consider anthropogenic amendment or fertilisation of the soil, reflected in the nature of the groundmass (Fig. 1). The effects of cultivation and the resilience of the formed features appear to be affected by the nature of the soil; by the type, seasonality, and frequency of tillage operations and by the concentration of soil amendments (see Wilson et al., 2002).

Many of the structural changes in soils following tillage are seasonal in nature (Hall, 1994), but abandoned agricultural soils may demonstrate the stability of these microstructures over longer periods (Gebhardt, 1993). However, high levels of bioturbation in old agricultural soils have been considered to explain the total loss of cultivation-related structural features and the development of crumb microstructures in fields abandoned 200 and 40 years ago (Davidson, 2002). Similarly, experimental tillage studies suggest that bioturbation effects may become dominant within a decade (Boersma & Kooistra, 1994). Even limited levels of bioturbation have been shown to alter the growth pattern of mycorrhiza, which, in turn, has an impact on soil microstructure (Johnson et al., 2001; Staddon & Fitter, 2001).

# 2.1.2 Burning of Soils and Above-ground Vegetation

The practice of clearing vegetation by managed fire regimes is adopted for many different purposes worldwide. This includes traditional heathland clearance (Dodgshon & Olsson, 2006), 'slash-and-burn' rotational agricultural systems and partial clearance of above-ground vegetation in plantations (Sant'anna et al., 2009).

Although fire clearance is still practised in many agricultural contexts worldwide, some burning practices are less common today than in past times. One such practice is the production of charcoal, which was very common in Europe until the use of coal became widespread in the 18th and 19th centuries. Such charcoal production can give rise to pronounced anthropogenically modified soils in European forests containing charcoal, burned soil fragments and exotic components (e.g., diatoms, phytoliths) (Gebhardt, 2007). With the efficiency of the charcoal production increased by the continuous reuse of charcoal production sites, tightly clustered spatial areas with intense anthropogenic soil modification may be found as a legacy of this practice (Gebhardt, 2007).

Experimental studies of changes in micromorphological features through burning typically consider a small set of experimental factors, including temperature and duration of the fire. As part of an experiment that contrasted different burning frequencies, Phillips et al. (2000) also reported strong differences in the type and abundance of micromorphological features linked to changes in bioturbation. It is clear that to develop an understanding of soil burning and addition of burnt materials requires consideration of temporal factors beyond the duration and intensity of a single fire event.

In an early study of colours resultant from soil burning, Mathieu and Stoops (1972) linked these shifts to the mineralogical composition of iron oxides. Many subsequent studies (see Deak et al., 2017) have examined similar phenomena to develop interpretations of past land use. Although these experimental studies, typically using strongly contrasting conditions, are useful in examination of a well-defined burning

event, distinctions between natural fires and human-induced fires within a specific landscape context are much less pronounced. To address this important distinction, recent developments in stable isotope analysis of pyrogenic carbon (Ascough et al., 2011; Bird & Ascough, 2012) may prove to be a useful means of validating micromorphological assessment.

The direct effects of fire on soil are dependent on the texture and mineralogical composition of the soil and on the intensity, oxygen regime and temperature of the fire. Courty et al. (1989) suggest that these conditions may result in planar voids in coarse-textured soils, along with disaggregation of surface aggregates and the development of vesicular voids. Intraaggregate planar voids were also noted for soils affected by fires of moderate intensity  $(350 - 450^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ , whereas at higher temperatures fragmentation of aggregates and the development of a granular structure through subsequent biological activity have been reported across soils of various textures (Phillips et al., 2000; Mallol et al., 2007).

# 2.1.3 Irrigation

The most commonly reported effects of irrigation on soil microstructure are disaggregation of aggregates and a decrease in porosity. For example, Prikhod'ko (2002) found that irrigation of Chernozems led to disintegration of mineral and organic aggregates. This structural degradation was most pronounced in clay-rich soils. Infilling of pores by disaggregated materials also led to a decrease in porosity. However, in some other instances, such as Solonetz soils and vertic Chernozems, irrigation has been noted to increase faunal activity, resulting in a crumb or granular microstructure and in increased porosity (Prikhod'ko, 2002; Tursina, 2002). The alkalinity of irrigation water is also an issue, as it affects the dispersivity of the soil materials. Tursina (2002) reports that irrigation using highly alkaline waters of a lake in Ukraine caused considerable loss of structure and formation of a surface crust, in contrast to sewage waters that caused little change in porosity. Bresson and Moran (2004) found that flood irrigation, in particular, causes collapse of soil structure and the development of hard-setting soil crusts (see also Pagliai & Stoops, 2010; Williams et al., 2018).

Wet rice cultivation produces distinctive soil profiles with an anthraquic surface horizon underlain by a hydraulic horizon (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015). Typically, these soils are apedal or have weakly developed crumb or blocky microstructures, and they can have a high porosity dominated by channels (Arimura, 1976; Miura et al., 1992). At the base of the anthraquic horizon, a plough pan with a platy microstructure frequently develops (Gong et al., 1998). The hydraulic horizon is typically also apedal, but with a significantly lower channel- and vugh-dominated porosity (Fig. 2) compared with the anthraquic horizon (Hseu & Chen, 1997). Seasonality of changes in microstructure in wet cultivation systems is poorly researched to date, but the importance of shrinkage in the development of structural properties of paddy field soil has been demonstrated (Janssen et al., 2006).

FIGURE 2 Typical aspect of a hydraulic horizon, with an apedal microstructure, few channels and vugs, an orthic iron oxide nodule with diffuse boundaries and a strial b-fabric in part of the groundmass (paddy soils, Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka) (XPL).

# 2.1.4 Other Practices

Agricultural practices other than tillage and burning may be recognised to directly influence soil microstructure development (e.g., Dalrymple & Jim, 1984; Ricks Presley et al., 2004), but because tillage operations are usually also involved, it can be hard to isolate the features that those other practices produce. The reported effects of manuring and liming on soil microstructure are largely explained by increased bioturbation. This can result in the development of crumb microstructure, increased soil porosity, particularly microporosity, and the development of channels (Pagliai et al., 2004; Grieve et al., 2005). Where the addition of inorganic materials results in vertical accretion of topsoils, compaction lower in the profile can produce apedal intervals, as with deep plaggen soils (Meharg et al., 2006).

Less well understood are the effects on microstructure and aggregate development of combined manuring and tillage. Most agricultural systems rely on the use of managed fertiliser inputs, which in traditional farming systems are organic manures. In many circumstances, their use may cause no visible increase in soil organic matter content because of its rapid decomposition or uptake by crops. Barratt (1967, 1970) examined the effect of various fertiliser inputs to soils under pasture in long-term field experiments, revealing distinct differences between treatments with respect to both humus form and associated microstructures. These distinctive soil fabrics are often the result of changes in the nature and distribution of faecal materials.

A comparative assessment of orchard soils showed that microstructural features related to earthworm activity are different for plots where different agricultural practices

were applied and that a relative absence of earthworms led ultimately to compaction of the uppermost horizons (Jongmans et al., 2003). Pulleman et al. (2005), in field experiments considering the effect of earthworm activity on soil microstructure, have demonstrated that clear differences emerge due to the combined effects of tillage and manuring, with clay enrichment of aggregates rich in organic matter. These were found to be common in soils under pasture but not when the same soil was subject to conventional tillage.

Where soils are extensively reworked by soil animals, infillings with crescent-like fabric features may result from welding together of earthworm casts (Bal, 1973). In this and other experimental studies (Spring, 2003; Davidson et al., 2004), individual faecal materials from other soil animals have been identified as soil aggregates. The tracks left by the movement of these animals may result in small-scale compaction or bioturbation. An experimental study of earthworm activity by Péres et al. (1998) allowed surface porosity, granular aggregate formation and earthworm abundance to be correlated with organic amendment treatments.

Both the chemical and physical properties of the amending materials are of importance. Considering the former, excessive use of peat and turf materials as an alternative to farmyard manure may lead to soil acidification, which, in turn, may alter the microfabric through suppression of faunal activity (Collins & Coyle, 1980). Soil organic matter 'recalcitrance', a concept criticised by Bayeve and Laba (2015), is increasingly being clarified and understood through combinations of micromorphology and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. In addition to the role of soil animals and microbiota in the physical comminution of organic matter (e.g., Chaparro et al., 2012), the consideration of soil enzyme processes (e.g., Min et al., 2015), the understanding of the role of phenolic compounds in inhibiting these enzymes in anthropogenic soils (e.g., Esiana, 2015) and the interrelationship between such processes and microfabric (e.g., Baldock & Skjemstad, 2000) are allowing a new understanding of organic matter transformations in soils to develop.

# 2.2 Technosols and Urban Soils

Because of the great diversity of waste materials and the large variations in intensity of their impact, identifying specific structural features associated with urban soils is more difficult than for many agricultural soils. The diversity of recorded microstructures thereby reflects the diversity of deposits and processes. For example, areas of land that are affected by trampling, such as recreational footpaths or animal tracks, may be characterised by massive or platy microstructures, compaction and low porosity, whereas some Technosols may be granular with frequent channels, depending on the level of biological activity (Giani et al., 2004; Vissac, 2005). Compaction in deep sequences of anthropogenic soils typically results in low porosities, apedal microstructures and a lack of horizonation (Davidson et al., 2006).

# 3. Groundmass

The groundmass has important interpretative value in anthropogenic soils, besides allowing to establish which soil-forming processes were dominant before the onset of human activity (see also Stoops & Mees, 2018). Imprints of such later activity may also be expressed in the groundmass through deliberate or accidental inputs and through reorganisation of mineral, biogenic and organic materials. Where anthropogenic soils result from additions of materials rather than disturbance, there can be a distinctive effect on particle size distribution (Davidson et al., 2007). These instances may also result in differences in c/f ratio between those soils and unamended surrounding soils. Therefore, this ratio itself may have interpretative value. This effect has been noted in connection with the addition of lime materials to irrigated agricultural soils, which resulted in the presence of various carbonates in surface horizons and in modified patterns of aggregation (van Oort et al., 2008). Furthermore, the alteration of hydrological properties and aeration through compaction or other anthropogenic processes can result in significant physicochemical changes. These changes may affect the stability of individual components, resulting in their differential alteration and hence changing the c/f ratio.

# 3.1 Coarse Mineral Components

Mineral artefacts that end up in a soil because of waste disposal, land reclamation and manuring are among the most widespread and resilient features of anthropogenic intervention. These artefacts may remain relatively inert in the soil or act as a stimulant, inhibitor or modifier of ongoing soil processes, such as biological turnover by soil animals (Jones et al., 1994).

# 3.1.1 Agricultural Soils

Anthropogenic coarse mineral components in agricultural soils include amending materials such as inorganic residues from burning of vegetation, inorganic fertilisers and lime and deliberately added exogenous soil materials. The latter include artefacts (e.g., pottery, glass) as well as animal and plant remains (e.g., bone, wood), as commonly described in archaeological studies (Macphail & Goldberg, 2010, 2018). Soils with distinct concentrations of animal and plant remains include black-earth soils from Amazonia (Arroyo-Kalin, 2010, 2012), French Guiana (Brancier et al., 2014), and West Africa (Fairhead & Leach, 2008). In contexts where large quantities of wood ash and plant ash are deliberately applied to increase soil fertility, instrumental colour analysis of optical microscopy images may allow identification of various ash materials (Simpson et al., 2002; Adderley et al., 2006). Similarly, with advances in sampling and analysis techniques for features in soil sections, such as microdrilling (van Oort et al., 1994; Denaix et al., 1999) and laser ablation ICP-MS (Bruneau et al., 2002), previously intractable questions relating to the effects of anthropogenic processes can be traced.

Mixing of different surface horizons and mixing of soil materials and exogenous materials are two tillage-related processes, most readily interpreted by analysis of thin sections (Miedema, 1997). Besides mixing of surface organic horizons with mineral subsurface horizons, tillage may also result in incorporation of natural surface deposits, such as coarse volcanic ash, creating banded patterns (Wilson et al., 2002). Prolonged tillage may result in significant changes in soil texture of the surface horizons of soils, through mixing of materials or through differential mineral weathering (Pang et al., 2006). The redistribution of residues of biogenic silica thin section has been used to describe different tillage disturbances (Golyeva, 2001; Clarke, 2003). Similarly, calcitic spheroids have been used as an indicator of past earthworm activity (Jongmans et al., 2001). In these instances, the relative distribution of this type of residues, which also include sponge spicules and diatoms, provides information on the origin of soil materials. However, the use of these residues as an indicator of tillage requires careful consideration of both their seasonal production and their short- and long-term preservation.

# 3.1.2 Technosols

Technosols are largely defined by the presence of significant quantities of artefactual materials in the coarse fraction. In urban soils, the range of inclusions that may be encountered is vast, and there may be huge vertical and lateral variations in their nature and abundance. Technic materials may include redeposited stone, mineral soil and sediment fragments, brick, cement, concrete, mortar and other construction debris, as well as bone, shell, asphalt, glass, slag and metallic objects (Alexandrovskaya & Alexandrovskiy, 2000; Prokof'eva et al., 2001).

# 3.2 Micromass

As previously discussed, additions of mineral materials to soils may occur as a result of land management. In addition to the changes that such materials may present in respect of the c/f ratio, distinct alterations of the limpidity and b-fabric of the micromass may occur (Wilson et al., 2002; Stoops, 2003). Reorganisation of the fabric through increased soil fauna activity can lead to the creation of areas with an undifferentiated b-fabric. Such areas may also result from incorporation of organic materials through diffusion of colloidal organic matter and illuviation of substances in solution (Babel, 1975). These changes have been reported as the development of bands with darker micromass (Fig. 3) and of parallel striated b-fabrics linked to compaction and shear forces. Changes in b-fabric and the appearance of a dotted limpidity can be interpreted as the incorporation of small fragments of carbonised materials. The presence of a crystallitic b-fabric in calcareous Chernozems has been linked to irrigation, resulting in dissolution and recrystallisation of carbonates (Tursina, 2002).

# 4. Organic Components

The observation of organic components and of their interaction with mineral components is essential in understanding anthropogenic impacts on soil organisation and the resulting changes in physical, chemical and biological properties. It is often difficult to generalise observations from past studies because the imprint found in the soil groundmass is determined by the combination of processes and soil properties, which are unique and case-specific. For example, contrasting results have been obtained for the effect of anthropogenic activity on organic matter content of the groundmass. Studies of modern and ancient cultivated soils in Yemen revealed an increase in all classes of plant residues in irrigated soils (Verba et al., 1995), and high organic matter contents have also been recorded for Mediterranean terrace soils (Darwish & Zurayk, 1997), buried cultivated soils in Ecuador (Wilson et al., 2002) and anthraquic paddy soil horizons (Miura et al., 1992; Gong et al., 1998), presumably as a result of manuring. However, Jongerius (1983) and Simpson et al. (1998) report a decline in total organic matter content, following cultivation.

Observations of organic components are of interest in the study of anthropogenic soils, because they may reveal chemical imprints of anthropogenic actions, as well as mechanical stress from physical or biological perturbation. The imprint of organic components such as roots may influence the groundmass. This may not be limited to the physical extent of the isolated component seen in thin sections. FitzPatrick (1993), for instance, discusses effects of roots that extend far into the groundmass. Such patterns may be the result of either active or former root systems. With respect to identification of palaeosols, which commonly show superimposed relict fabric features (Kemp, 1999), the recognition of features recording the former presence of crop plant species may be of

particular concern. In a review of biophysical interactions at the root-soil interface, Young (1998) has demonstrated that observable changes, including soil structural alterations, can extend up to  $10\mathrm{mm}$  from the root surface. The so-called 'terra preta' or 'black-earth' soils, first identified as a marker of pre-Colombian human activity in Amazonia (Denevan, 2003), are characterised by high concentrations of charcoal, bone fragments and other charred residues compared with neighbouring undisturbed Oxisols (McCann et al., 2001; Woods et al., 2006; Arroyo-Kalin, 2010). The nature of the amending materials has been of principal interest; however, other groundmass features have also been reported. For example, comminuted charcoal may enter the soil and be incorporated into the groundmass through bioturbation. Likewise, highly comminuted bone materials have been reported for some black-earth sites (Schaefer et al., 2004) in Amazonia, but this anthropogenic signature is lacking at other localities (Brancier et al., 2014).

# 5. Pedofeatures

The impact of anthropogenic activity on soils and regoliths is most frequently interpreted through consideration of relationships between distinct pedofeatures and groundmass features. Studies of pedofeature development can be based on thin section observations following field-scale experimentation, with suitable controls such that the genesis of observed features can be attributed to human activity. Although the range of anthropogen-derived pedofeatures is vast (Miedema et al., 1994), several key features have become established in the canon of soil micromorphology. Such features include those indicative of large-scale field practices, such as cultivation, irrigation and fertilisation.

# 5.1 Large-Scale Field Practices

# 5.1.1 Tillage

In most temperate soils, the primary impacts of tillage at the profile scale are compaction and a change in soil pH (Babel, 1975). These changes will affect biological processes, and they will result in the development of a range of pedofeatures, as described below. Regardless of the context, associating tillage operations with specific pedofeatures requires careful interpretation because not all pedofeatures present will have formed as a result of those activities. Because tillage is likely to be done repeatedly, pedofeatures specific to surface horizons in arable farming systems, including excremental features (Davidson, 2002) (Fig. 4) and dusty clay coatings (agricutans; Jongerius, 1970), can only give an indication of the environment at the time of formation. The presence or absence of dusty clay coatings and clay coatings darkened by organic matter has been discussed extensively as an indicator of tillage activity, reflecting successional patterns of deposition (e.g., Usai, 2001; Deak et al., 2017). Illuviation features including dusty coatings resultant from ploughing have also been used as an indicator of past agricultural practice (Jongerius, 1983). However, the validity of using the occurrence of

FIGURE 4 Mixed excrements of earthworms (a) and springtails (Collembola sp.) (b), in old cultivated soils (Sourhope, Scotland) (PPL, blue dyed resin).

coarse textural coatings as a diagnostic tool for anthropogenic activity has been questioned by the finding that such features can also develop through natural processes (Dalrymple & Theocharopoulos, 1987; see also Kuhn et al., 2018). Wilson et al. (2002) found abundant mammilate excrements, infillings with bow-like patterns, silty clay coatings (Fig. 5) and amorphous iron/manganese oxide nodules and depletion pedofeatures. Pedofeatures that have been used as an indicator in studies of tillage include

organic matter accumulations in pores and incremental pedofeatures infilling relict faunal channels (Bal, 1973; Kleyer & Babel, 1984). Lima et al. (2002) and Ruivo et al. (2003) both cite instances of illuvial clay occurring in faunal burrows.

# 5.1.2 Fertilisation

Studies of pedofeatures related to fertiliser use are particularly valuable in examining land management practices over long periods and have been extensively applied in historical and archaeological studies (Davidson & Carter, 1998; Carter, 2001; Usai, 2001; Simpson et al., 2002; Adderley et al., 2006). Where the materials applied are organic, such as farmyard manures, fuel ashes, sewage sludges and industrial wastes, various pedofeatures may result, including carbonate coatings and illuvial clay coatings (Lima et al., 2002; Xiubin et al., 2002; van Oort et al., 2008). Discrete pedofeatures may appear following biological or chemical alteration of exogenous amending materials. A special case of organic amendment is the use of other soil materials to improve soil fertility, as in plaggen soils (Fig. 6) and hortic soils (Pape, 1970; Spek et al., 2003; Davidson et al., 2004; Adderley et al., 2006). Typically, these soils contain excremental (see Fig. 4) and textural pedofeatures. In tropical contexts, Schaefer et al. (2004) have noted clear channel infillings of B horizon materials in A horizons, and vice versa, as well as abundant excrement pedofeatures producing a distinctive crumb structure at the soil surface.

# 5.1.3 Irrigation and Wet Cultivation

Irrigation of fields can lead to the development of a range of pedofeatures, distinct from those resulting from associated tillage. In soils already physically disturbed by tillage, irrigation can result in the formation of textural coatings such as clay coatings preserved

FIGURE 6 Fragments of amorphous uncarbonised materials rich in organic matter, containing some quartz grains and rhyolite fragments (a); the materials are probably turf residues from plaggen-type manuring, in intensively managed soils (Kailyard areas, Papa Sour, Shetland Isles) (PPL) (see Adderley et al., 2006).

in iron oxide nodules (e.g., Brinkman et al., 1973) and clay infillings in the pore space between microaggregates in the plough layer and lower horizons (e.g., Verba et al., 1995, 2002; Prikhod'ko, 2002; Tursina, 2002; Soares et al., 2005). However, irrigation water composition, inherent soil properties and the timing and nature of other tillage and manuring operations have a strong influence on the nature, development and persistence of textural features. For irrigated saline soils, Verba et al. (1995, 2002) note the formation of carbonate-clay coatings, and for chernozemic soils, Tursina (2002) describes coatings that are predominantly dark and rich in organic matter. The effects of irrigation on the oxidation state of soils, particularly cultivated soils with degraded structure and clay-illuvial horizons, are responsible for the common occurrence of depletion and impregnative iron oxide pedofeatures, including nodules and hypocoatings. Their development may be promoted by incorporation of organic matter at depth through ploughing. Costantini et al. (2006) report an increase in abundance of micritic calcite nodules with increasing depth. The frequency of iron oxide impregnation pedofeatures may also increase with proximity to any plough pan present.

In irrigated calcareous or saline soils, various pedofeatures may develop through dissolution and reprecipitation, such as impregnative calcitic features, including calcite nodules along void walls and the sides of sand grains, as well as carbonate depletion features (e.g., Prikhod'ko, 2002; Verba et al., 2002; Costantini et al., 2006). In the context of long-term historic irrigation of soils derived from calcareous alluvium, the formation of calcite nodules was observed, but translocation of fine materials was notably absent (El-Khatib & Stoops, 1987).

In soils under wet rice cultivation, impregnation and depletion pedofeatures of iron and manganese oxides are common features (Miura et al., 1992; Hseu & Chen, 1997; Gong et al., 1998; Zhang & Gong, 2003), throughout both the anthraquic and hydraulic horizons. Alternating wetting and drying, together with physical disturbance through ploughing, may also result in the formation of textural clay and silt pedofeatures. Miura et al. (1992) found that such textural features are less common in wet cultivation soils than in dry upland rice cultivation systems. They also note that extinction lines observed for the clay coatings tend to be diffuse, which has been ascribed to the aquic moisture regime of these soils.

# 5.2 Technosols and Urban Soil Contexts

In urban contexts, pedofeatures have been related to soil sealing and soil disturbance during construction of paths, roads or buildings (International Committee for Anthropogenic Soils, 2007). The resulting pedofeatures include iron oxide depletion and impregnation features resulting from anoxic conditions below sealed surfaces (Prokof'eva et al., 2001; Vissac, 2005). Soils in urban contexts typically exhibit raised pH because of additions of calcareous building materials and other waste materials (Schleuss et al., 1998; Zhao et al., 2007). As a result of the addition of calcareous, sulphidic or phosphatic waste materials, intrusive crystallitic pedofeatures of calcite,

gypsum, vivianite and other minerals can be present (Alexandrovskaya & Alexandrovskiy, 2000). Prokof'eva et al. (2001) report that compared with local undisturbed Chernozems, soils in Moscow have a high carbonate content, containing carbonates in the form of crystals, crystal intergrowths, spherulites, nodules and coatings.

# 6. Conclusions

Although there are many challenges to developing, through micromorphology, an understanding of soils and regoliths that have been influenced by direct human interventions, the application of micromorphology to Anthrosols and Technosols may lead to better understanding of their development and may allow improvement of their future management. Identification of the nature and intensity of human interventions, which is typically expected from micromorphologists in studies of Anthrosols and Technosols, is confounded by many process-led and land management issues.

The use of soil micromorphology has been demonstrated to help in risk assessment of metal-polluted soils of various types (e.g., Labanowski et al., 2007; van Oort et al., 2008). Seasonal changes, and the different rates of change for natural and anthropogenic processes operating in a single soil profile, create many localised phenomena and localised alterations of different soil constituents. This poses a major challenge to sampling design when extensive landscapes are considered. Despite such difficulties, there is a growing need to interpret anthropogenic features in soils and regoliths to deepen our understanding of the sustainability of both present-day and future land use.

Finally, considering past land use and conceptualising the Anthropocene as a geological epoch, soil micromorphology of anthropogenic features has an important role in developing a clearer understanding of the historical onset of land management.

# 1. Introduction

This chapter deals with the use of soil micromorphology for examining archaeological materials, to understand their formation and the manner in which they enter the archaeological record. This knowledge can then be applied to reconstruct past human

technologies and activities, especially when combined with microfacies analysis (Courty, 2001). Included in the discussion are natural soils and sediments employed in constructions that have been little transformed. These elements should be readily recognisable to workers experienced in natural soils and sediments. In contrast, archaeological materials found in occupation areas often have origins and formation processes completely outside the experience of most micropedologists and petrologists. This article is therefore partly meant to familiarise them with these somewhat atypical objects in thin section. Lastly, manufactured materials are often familiar to material scientists, such as archaeometallurgists, but it is important that these materials, and their weathered transformations, are readily recognised more widely in thin section. The variety of archaeological materials being reported on has grown exponentially since the 1980s (Courty et al., 1989) and as a result only a restricted coverage of the subject is offered here. Soil micromorphological descriptions and supportive data are detailed in referenced articles and in the figure captions.

# 2. Natural Soils and Sediments Employed in Construction

Natural materials, such as turf, brickearth, loess, alluvium and till, can be employed in their raw state or be mixed with various mineral and plant tempers to produce adobe materials, such as daub and mud brick (see Fig. 3C). Various raw, little-transformed and burned variants will be examined here.

When encountered in their raw state, natural soils and sediments used as constructional materials may be difficult to discern. Thin sections can show the occurrence of a natural material which is not present in a local natural soil or sediment and which is thus anomalous or exotic. The archaeological context may provide key information (e.g., mound or tumulus, floor or wall within a structure), but sometimes the context is not clear, and the presence of soils and sediments as a constructional material may only be recognised on the basis of soil horizons or sediments being in anomalous positions. For example, the occurrence of Bt horizon material along with textural pedofeatures (e.g., clay coatings) that are not oriented according to the present 'way-up' position may indicate that a soil slab has been used for construction. When soils are employed, different horizons can be used. The use of Ah, A2, Bt and Ctk horizons of Luvisols have been reported, alongside turves from podzols (Evans, 1957; Fenton, 1968; Macphail, 1987, 2003). However, field and archaeological explanations may well be wrong, and it is the chief role of soil micromorphology to correct these interpretations (see Fig. 3A).

# 2.1 Turf

Turf (topsoil) has been employed ubiquitously to construct mounds and ramparts in temperate regions (Van Nest, et al., 2001; Goldberg & Macphail, 2006). It can provide important environmental information on past landscapes, especially when combined with dating, palynology and the study of land snails (Alexandrovskiy & Chichagova, 1998; also

note pioneer studies by Dimbleby (1962), Evans (1972) and reports by I. Cornwall reviewed by Macphail (1987)) (Fig. 1). Turf has specific characteristics according to the edaphic conditions under which it formed and the types of organic forms, such as mull, moder and mor. Excrements of soil mesofauna and preservation of organic matter reflect these conditions (Babel, 1975; Bal, 1982; Nys et al., 1987; see also Gerasimova & Lebedeva-Verba, 2010; Stolt & Lindbo, 2010; Gerasimova & Lebedeva, 2018; Ismail-Meyer et al., 2018; Kooistra & Pulleman, 2018). For example, at some poorly drained locations, grass litter decays slowly at the soil surface as thin microlaminated layers of leaves and excrements forming a laminated mull (Barrat, 1964); the initial construction of both Hadrian's Wall ( $\sim$ AD 122) near Carlisle, United Kingdom, and the Viking Age Gokstad Ship Burial Mound near Sandefjord, Vestfold, Norway, employed laminated mull turves, with sedge grassland being the turf source at Gokstad (Macphail et al., 2013).

The presence of turf or buried turf (Carter, 1990) can be recognised from its humic and biological character in the form of pure organic matter, mineral soil with high organic matter content organised as organo-mineral excrements and sometimes a preponderance of organic excrements of all sizes, with structures and excrements becoming generally finer up-profile; note, however, that the broad organic excrements of commuters may most commonly occur in surface organic horizons. Plant residues and relict roots may also be expected to be more numerous in an upward direction, thus pointing to the 'right-way-up' for the turf (Fig. 1).

During mound or rampart construction, any type of turf can be employed. Romans and Robertson (1983) suggested that the 5.5-m-high Neolithic mound at Strathallan, Scotland, was constructed of poorly stable agricultural topsoil; this construction led to disaggregation and the formation of very abundant textural pedofeatures (dusty clay void coatings and silty clay infillings) (Barclay, 1983; Macphail et al., 1987). Both grazed grassland and woodland turf were collected to construct the putative mound at Romano-British Folly Lane, St Albans, whereas a series of Bronze Age mounds at West Heath were constructed from acid heathland turf developed on podzols (Scaife & Macphail, 1983; Macphail et al., 1998; see also Macphail et al., 2003).

Turf may be laid 'right-way-up', inverted or face to face. The experimental grassland mull turf roof at Umeå, north Sweden, was constructed with the bottom turf facing downwards and the upper ('living') turf facing upwards (Cruise & Macphail, 2000; Goldberg & Macphail, 2006) (Fig. 1). Modern Icelandic turf roofs have been investigated by Milek (2006). Turf roofs cannot be made out of modern or mor horizons because these are prone to rapid oxidation and decay.

The remains of (burned) grass turf wall material from the estimated 1-m-thick and 1.5-m-high walls from Iron Age Denmark were identified by a microaggregated fabric and highly humic aspect (Nørnberg & Courty, 1985). Similarly, turf fragments in a sunken building were found to contain organo-mineral and amorphous organic matter; minerogenic lenses within turf fragments are relict of rapid tephra fallout (Simpson et al., 1999). Viking house turf walls have also been studied to investigate contemporary soils (Milek, 2004).

Turf in mounds and buried turf (in situ topsoil) undergo various transformations. Changes related to a decrease in pH have been reported (Macphail, 1993; Crowther et al., 1996). In field experiments, base-rich turf became compact as organo-mineral excrements became coalesced, and a more acidic mesofauna producing thin bacillocylinders became dominant (Crowther et al., 1996). At Neolithic Easton Down, Wiltshire, the base-rich but decalcified turf that had formed on chalk seems to have been transformed in exactly the same way (Macphail, 1993). On loess over chalk at the turf rampart of Neolithic Belle Tout, East Sussex, no individual excrements are visible, and only the compact remains of a totally biologically reworked microfabric with relict fabric features of burrowing are present in a soil with a superimposed accommodating angular blocky microstructure. In acid sandy soils, compaction and 'ageing' can lead to changes in c/f-related distribution pattern (from enaulic progressively to chitonic, gefuric and porphyric), a decrease in interference colours of the plant material and preferential preservation of poorly decomposable organic materials (lignified cells) and charcoal (Scaife & Macphail, 1983; Macphail et al., 2003). In other field experiments and at a Bronze Age site, the base of the turf core displays a predominantly porphyric c/f-related distribution pattern and well-preserved organic matter, presumably due to the maintenance of soil wetness. Organic matter and turf layers may become mineralised through postdepositional movement of sesquioxides (Runia, 1988; Macphail et al., 2003). The chemical and micromorphological transformation of barrow turf into spodic

pyrophosphate and dithionite Fe- and Al-enriched monomorphic material was reported by Fisher and Macphail (1985) (see also Vepraskas et al., 2018). Mounds can develop iron/manganese oxide pans because of localised waterlogging, which tends to accentuate turf structures within them, as well as the contact between the mound and the underlying soil; at the Gokstad Mound mobile phosphate had formed concentrations of vivianite in litter-rich turf layers (Bouma et al., 1990; Macphail et al., 1998, 2013). Fragments of turf, which retain characteristic biological microfabrics such as thin burrows (passage features) and excrements, are sometimes common components in the fills of sunken feature houses (e.g., Grubenhäuser) because of collapsed turf walls and roofs constructed from turf (Simpson et al., 1999; Macphail et al., 2006a; Milek, 2006).

# 2.2 Ground-Raising Constructional Materials

Constructions often include ground-raising and surface-sealing activities (Blume, 1989). Raw materials derived from local soils and underlying bedrock are often employed (see Figs. 2 to 4). In northwest Europe, for example, this material is commonly derived from the typical Luvisols formed on loess and from aeolian silt with alluvial admixtures of sand (brickearth). In the Balkans and in the Near and Middle East, tells include mud bricks derived from local alluvial soils (Goldberg, 1979; Rosen, 1986; Stoops & Nijs, 1986; Matthews et al., 1996; Haita, 2003; Love, 2012; Macphail et al., 2017a). The presence of rounded clay clasts and allochthonous carbonate nodules can be indicative of an alluvial soil origin (Goldberg, 1979; see also Nodarou et al., 2008). From Roman, medieval to modern times, these materials were employed in urban areas for levelling ground ahead of construction (Macphail, 1994). Sometimes burned daub from razed buildings was also used. Mesopotamian tells also developed through incidental and deliberate ground-raising and the accumulation of decayed mud brick (Friesem et al., 2011). This was brought about by dumps of all kinds of anthropogenic materials, such as ashes and building debris, which were also employed as 'constructional packing' below constructed plaster floors and matted surfaces (Matthews & Postgate, 1994; Matthews, 1995; Matthews et al., 1996) (see Fig. 8A). At Phoenician Tel Dor, Israel, however, ground-raising associated with manufactured floors and animal penning episodes was achieved through refuse accumulation associated with occupation (Shahack-Gross et al., 2005). Microdebris included wood ash, bone, charcoal, ceramics, constructional materials and abundant phytoliths. There have been similar findings at other Middle Eastern sites (Stoops & Nijs, 1986; Boivin & French, 1997/1998; Matthews et al., 1998; Gur-Arieh et al., 2014).

Mounds constructed of soil include medieval mottes in Europe (e.g., Gebhardt & Langohr, 1999) and Mississippian Culture mounds in the United States (Sherwood, 2006). Nevertheless, mound-raising may involve both the use of coherent soil slabs and simply dumping of soil, regolith and rock fragments in so-called basket loads. In these, the various soil materials become mixed as soil clasts and form a heterogeneous layer. In this case, the once-open voids are commonly filled with dusty to impure clay that is

associated with textural intercalations whose texture is governed by the original grain size of the soil, all because of slaking of disturbed soil. This phenomenon was also noted by Romans and Robertson (1983) for barrow constructions and is similar to disturbed tree-throw hollow fills and to soils transported, deposited and modified under freeze-thaw conditions (Mücher, 1974; Macphail & Goldberg 1990; Macphail, 1999). The presence of the aforementioned pedofeatures, which are anomalous for a natural soil profile, may help distinguish between buried natural soils and ground-raising that uses soil. Lastly, construction layers employing dumped soils may develop reddish colours in the field (Sherwood, 2006), because iron-stained clay is concentrated in clay infillings and fine intercalations, but it remains conjectural whether such red layers were constructed intentionally (Courty et al., 1989).

# 2.3 Floors, Surfaces and Walls

Floors have been constructed from various coherent loamy and clayey deposits that are local to a site, producing so-called clay floors (Rentzel, 2011). In coastal sandy areas, estuarine silty clay (Macphail, 1990) and till (Nørnberg & Courty, 1985) have been used to produce stable living surfaces. Local wetland sediments, often rich in phytoliths and diatoms, have been imported to produce daub and clay floors, for example, in Iron Age and Migration Period (c. AD 0 to 600) houses at Jarlsberg, Vestfold and Åker gård, Hedmark, Norway (Viklund et al., 2013; McGraw, personal communication); at the unusually well-preserved site of Åker gård, byre areas (see Section 3.2.1) had earth floors strengthened by being pebbled, while relict periglacial silt loans were favoured for hearth constructions. The artificiality of such floors is inferred from the occasional inclusion of anthropogenic materials (e.g., charcoal, pottery, burned daub, bone and, even rarely, coprolites) and various iron, iron phosphate and calcium phosphate staining of their surfaces and voids (hypocoatings). The construction of clay floors was not the case, however, in most Viking and medieval sites in Iceland (e.g., 12th-century Reykholt Farm in Borgarfjörður, Iceland; Sveinbjarnardóttir et al., 2007). In north-west Europe, brickearth and loess soils were employed to produce floor slabs of natural material (Figs. 2 and 3). This included soil from both the pale A2 horizon and the more clay-rich Bt and Ctk horizon; the latter may include relict calcitic pedofeatures. Such types of deposits are specifically built and represent truly constructed floors. They are, however, often found alternating with dark coloured, charcoal-rich occupation accumulations, which are not constructed floors per se but represent beaten or trampled material and are unlikely to have been deposited on purpose (Fig. 2). Constructed clay floors thus mark the renewal of a clean living surface (see also Matthews et al., 1996). At Reykholt Farm, this was achieved by creating thin clay plastered floors that alternate with occupation deposits (Sveinbjarnardóttir et al., 2007). The difference between a constructed floor and overlying beaten floor deposits can be noted in the field and in thin section as a knife-sharp,

FIGURE 2 Earth floors. Medieval floor and beaten floor sequence (Spitalfields Hospital, London, sample M499, layer 4850 over layer 4900; Museum of London Archaeological Service; Goldberg & Macphail, 2006). The brickearth floor is a prepared mixture composed of brickearth, 'soil' and anthropogenic inclusions, with an apparent 'white soil' plastered surface employing iron-poor soil (probable A2 horizon); a beaten floor has formed over this by trampling; the brickearth floor is affected by some iron phosphate staining compared with the beaten floor which is rich in various forms of phosphate (e.g., fine bone and coprolites), organic matter and burned material (ashes, charcoal, burned soil) (NL, scale bar length 1 cm).

The degree of lamination reflects the degree of humidity, the level of protection from the elements and the nature of any floor coverings (Gé et al., 1993; Cammas, 1994; Courty et al., 1994; Cammas et al., 1996; Matthews et al., 1997; Macphail et al., 2007). It has to be kept in mind, however, that floors were often swept, and sweepings were dumped elsewhere, and that 'occupation' deposits in fact result from 'disuse', squatter occupation or building decay (Macphail, 1994; Cowan, 2003; Galinié, personal communication; Sheldon, personal communication). Such deposits do not show the fine laminations as found in

beaten floors and are also more likely to be markedly contaminated by latrine waste, for example. The use of brickearth slabs to form walls within timber-framed buildings in Roman London has long been documented, and one intact fallen lime plaster-coated brickearth wall at 1st to 2nd century Southwark, London, sealed a short-lived disuse occupation deposit within an abandoned building shell that included, in addition to brickearth fragments, biomixed coarse and fine charcoal, bone, eggshell, amorphous organic matter and earthworm excrements (Cowan, 2003).

Constructed floors may show iron oxide and iron phosphate staining and associated vivianite formation (see Karkanas & Goldberg, 2018) because of contamination from liquid waste, but overall they are less phosphate-rich than the beaten occupation accumulations. In addition, the surface of soil slabs in constructed floors is sometimes 'mud plastered', which is recognisable because of the evidence of slaking, which concentrates infillings with clay and intercalations in the uppermost few millimetres. This plastering may have been carried out to produce a dark red colour, caused by the development of clay void coatings and intercalations where the iron content of the soil is concentrated in the clay, or simply to seal a surface. This type of surface plastering has been noted at various sites (Boivin, 1999; Matthews et al., 2000; Macphail & Crowther, 2007) (Figs. 2 to 4); it has been argued, however, that fresh plaster was not necessarily always employed and that fragmented material may have been reused (Karkanas & Van de Moortel, 2014). Sealing is also recognised for floors constructed from calcareous till (Chalky Boulder Clay) at the 12th-century wheat barn, Cressing Temple, Essex, and at Iron Age Uppåkra, Scania, Sweden, which has similar geology (Macphail, 1995; Macphail et al., 2017a). Roman sunken floor buildings on chalk had their subterranean floors sealed with rammed fine chalk (Bennett et al., 2008). This practice is expedient because minor recrystallisation of calcite produces a semicemented material without the use of lime. In the United Kingdom, chalky 'clunch' walls and a chalky daub called 'cob' have similar characteristics.

Floors were produced from brickearth, loess or till, which was often mixed with dung and other organic matter, including a plant temper such as straw (Karkanas, 2007). Through time, this organic matter decomposed, which leaves straight-sided voids pseudomorphic after straw (see Figs. 3 to 5). In some cases, phytoliths or iron and manganese oxide stains can be observed.

Building stone in constructions is outside the remit of this chapter, but when studying constructions, an understanding of petrographic features of rocks that were or could have been employed is obviously very useful. For example, Jurassic Oolitic limestone can be found within hydraulic mortar used in the construction of an aqueduct near Basel, Switzerland (Rentzel, 1998) (see Fig. 21), while Maya lime plaster floors were tempered with local siliceous and sponge-spicule-rich mud flat sediments at Marco Gonzalez, Belize, during the Early Classic to Late Classic (c. AD 250 to 700/760; Graham et al., 2017; Macphail et al., 2017b) (Fig. 8A). The study of Roman building materials at Pessinus, Turkey, included the characterisation of local limestone types and marble as background to the investigation of lime plasters (Stoops, 1984a). Soil micromorphology had to be employed to identify the use of quarried slabs of tufa as flooring material, which in the field had been mistakenly identified as manufactured lime plaster floors (Macphail & Crowther, 2007) (Fig. 3). In contrast to plaster, tufa is characterised by the blackened plant remains (Babel, 1975; Stoops, 2003) and by calcitic pseudomorphs after plant tissues (see Karkanas, 2007). Phytolith layers from oxidised stabling deposits, for example, have also been misidentified in the field as plaster floors because of their pale colour (Shahack-Gross et al., 2005; Albert et al., 2008).

The fills of sunken feature houses (e.g., Grubenhäuser) (Simpson et al., 1999; Milek, 2006; Wegener, 2009) can be modelled as having a soil fabric dominated by mesofauna excrements. In First Nation Canadian pit houses, anthropogenic materials including burned residues and coprolites are strongly mixed with earth-based and organic roofing debris by biological activity (Goldberg, 2000). This soil material can be either natural when the locality had been little altered by human activity or strongly anthropogenic. In the latter case, when settlements are long-established, evidence includes very abundant fine charcoal and rubefied mineral grains, abundant and articulated phytoliths, rare to occasional dung fragments and residues, and coprolites (Macphail et al., 2006b;

Macphail, 2016a). In sunken feature house fills, local silt or sandy loam hand-formed into loom weights during early medieval times can be found as anomalous fragments of clay or silt loam materials (Macphail et al., 2006b). Loom weights can be common inclusions in archaeological fills associated with textile manufacturing.

Mud brick, daub and adobe are similar earth-based building materials, which can be recognised from their composition, void patterns (if plant-tempered), inclusions (charcoal, dung, soil and sediment clasts) and, in some instances, the presence of textural and fabric pedofeatures or the occurrence of slaking if material is puddled or poured as a slurry into a mould, all of which can produce fabric heterogeneity from the employment of different soil materials and clayey intercalations merging into dusty clay void coatings where the voids are closed vugs or even vesicles (Levine et al., 2004; Goldberg & Macphail, 2006; Nodarou et al., 2008). When burned, these building materials preserve well, but they can be modified by weathering and reworked by colluvial transport (Goldberg, 1979) or totally transformed into soil through pedogenic processes (Goldberg, 1979; Macphail, 1994; Friesem et al., 2014a, 2014b).

Burned variants of the above-listed constructional materials often occur at archaeological sites (Kruger, 2015; Forget & Shahack-Gross, 2016). The chief characteristics caused by heating are blackening of once-humic areas (iron oxides are not strongly transformed because of localised reducing conditions or are incompletely burned) and reddening caused by the formation of hematite (oxidising conditions), best seen in OIL (Goldberg & Macphail, 2006). Another effect of heating is the formation of a crack structure, because of the loss of water by clay (Courty et al., 1989) (Figs. 4 and 5). In the case of experimental daub made from loess, a major change in macroscopic colour from hue 7.5 YR to 5 YR took place between 400 and  $500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  (Dammers & Joergensen, 1996). The inclusion of organic materials produced grey, reduced areas. Examples from an experimental straw-tempered oven and a Roman straw-tempered brickearth floor demonstrate how the straw becomes charred and the surrounding matrix shrinks through desiccation (Figs. 5 and 6). Clearly, the temperature affecting the floor was not

excessive, as the major loss of organic matter in daub tempered by barley straw occurs between 200 and  $300^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , with most organic material lost at  $400^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  (Dammers & Joergensen, 1996; see also Berna et al., 2007) (see Fig. 8B). At an early Neolithic site in Hungary, burned daub and burned plant-tempered daub constitute the most abundant evidence of constructions (Crowther, 2003, 2007; Macphail, 2003; Carneiro & Mateiciucova, 2007). Soil micromorphological and mineralogical analyses at Tel Dor reveal that surfaces constructed from local calcareous sandstone were heated to produce a plaster floor (Shahack-Gross et al., 2005); heated plaster floors also characterised salt working levels at Late Classic Marco Gonzalez, Belize (Graham et al., 2017) (Fig. 8A).

# 2.4 Organic Floor Coverings

Floors and surfaces were sometimes covered with organic materials, which include turfs (Milek, 2006), mats and, more conjecturally, skins (Courty, 2001; Courty et al., 1994; Macphail et al., 1997). These organic floor coverings occur in Palaeolithic to medieval sediments, where 'mats' are characterised by thin, millimetre-thick layers of articulated phytoliths of Poaceae (grasses, reeds, straw) or they consist of identifiable plant remains, as at the Middle Stone Age of Sibudu Cave, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (Goldberg et al., 2009b). As found in Viking Age Trondheim and Oslo, Norway, under waterlogged conditions, centimetre-thick accumulations of organic coverings can be preserved on wooden floors, which under more strongly oxidising conditions may be in part preserved by iron phosphate impregnation (Macphail & Goldberg, 2017, pp. 377-379). In certain cases, these surfaces are associated with horizontal planar voids and iron and phosphate staining of the associated fine sediments as a result of trampling and of the mat acting as a hydraulic barrier, a phenomenon that also affects many clay floors and other floor make-ups (Matthews et al., 1996; Macphail et al., 1997; Macphail, 2005; Milek, 2006). Voids between the woven mat fibres can be partially filled with thin organo-mineral excrements from both the buried soil and overlying trampled soil (Macphail & Cruise, 2001). Beaten floor deposits (Gé et al., 1993; Cammas, 1994; Cammas et al., 1996; Milek, 1997; Macphail et al., 2004, 2006b, 2007; Sveinbjarnardóttir et al., 2007) (see Fig. 2) that can form on floors and matted surfaces have been already briefly mentioned in Section 2.3. Some of the anthropogenic materials within them, and which help characterise both in situ use of space and local activities, will be dealt with in the following text (e.g., domestic/earth, stabling and industrial waste origins) (Cammas, 1994; Matthews et al., 1997; Banerjea et al., 2015).

# 3. Waste Materials

Human occupation produces concentrations of all kinds of organic and inorganic waste (Courty et al., 1989, 1994; Goldberg & Macphail, 2006). These are found in middens, structures, or pits or simply concentrated around hunter-gatherer campsites. Additionally, these occurrences are the focus of scavenging by animals that leave their own waste.

# 3.1 Inorganic Waste Materials

In addition to fuel residues (charcoal, clinker from coal, and charred peat, turf and dung) that generally can be found in and around occupation areas (Carter, 1998; Milek, 2005; Milek & French, 2007), inorganic waste materials were commonly employed in northern regions for soil amelioration, as for example the manured soils at Papa Stour, Shetland (Adderley et al., 2006). Hearths normally produce calcitic ash (Wattez & Courty, 1987; Courty et al., 1989; Shahack-Gross et al., 2004a, 2014), often in layers alternating with wood charcoal beds, the latter recording incomplete combustion, whereby the layered structure can be preserved in conditions of rapid burial (Fig. 7) (Macphail, 1990). In the last case, ethnoarchaeological observations of different Hadza hearth types in Tanzania revealed that differently functioning hearths were both disturbed and weathered by natural agencies, with people reusing hearths and scooping out ashes, for example; there have also been experiments to replicate Middle Palaeolithic hearth fires (Malol et al., 2007, 2013). The presence of vesicular porous char in hearths indicates the burning of flesh or animal fat (Goldberg et al., 2009b; Villagran et al., 2013; Mentzer, 2014). Although often converted by weathering into general poorly diagnostic micritic calcite masses (Courty et al., 1989; Gur-Arieh et al., 2014; Shahack-Gross et al., 2014), some wood ash can, on occasion, be preserved as coarse lozenge-shaped crystals, which are pseudomorphs after calcium oxalate crystals that formed inside the wood cells (Franceschi & Horner, 1980; Brochier, 1983; Wattez & Courty, 1987; Karkanas et al., 2007; Mentzer, 2014; Polodíaz et al., 2016), and termed POCC, an acronym of 'pseudomorphose d'oxalate de calcium en calcite' (Brochier & Thinon, 2003). If temperatures exceed  $600^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , these pseudomorphs are converted into lime (CaO), which in turn is transformed to undiagnostic micritic calcite by hydration and carbonation (Brochier & Thinon, 2003). Bark and leaves produce greater amounts of calcium oxalates than wood (Franceschi & Horner, 1980; Brochier & Thinon, 2003), and calcium oxalates are abundant where ashes are

derived mainly from stabling of animals foddered on woodland 'leaf hay'. Ash from grass, as well as from cereal processing and dung, produces finer crystals and an abundance of associated phytoliths, some of which may have melted to produce vesicular slags (Macphail & Cruise, 2001; Milek, 2005; Weiner, 2010) that can be enriched in phosphate (Fig. 7). These slags are autofluorescent in blue light, possibly because of a carbonate-substituted hydroxylapatite component (Weiner, 2010; Karkanas, personal communication). Burned phytoliths have a refractive index greater than 1.440 (Albert et al., 2008). Some siliceous burned monocotyledonous plant pseudomorphs are spherical in shape, or oblate when more strongly heated; these partially melted siliceous plant remains have seemingly vesicular voids which are simply relicts of natural vessels within stems (Macphail et al., 2012). Ash from cereal processing is often mixed with charred chaff (Macphail, 1991, 2000). Weathering, reuse of hearths and disturbance by digging scavengers can produce isolated and granular aggregates of ash. Some hearths produce burned bone (Karkanas et al., 2007), which appears to be more resistant to acid soil weathering than unburned bone, possibly because of alteration of the phosphate into a more stable, but unknown form than apatite (Berna, personal communication). Burned stones from hearths or burned rock mounds sometimes have residual ash cemented to their surfaces as a testimony to their hearth origin. Clearly, the accurate micromorphological and mineralogical identification of burned bone and hearth deposits in early human sites is crucial (Goldberg et al., 2001; Karkanas et al., 2007; Mentzer, 2014).

Burned food waste typically includes charred bone (rubefied, with lowered interference colours and lowered autofluorescence), calcined bone (whitish, optically isotropic and non-autofluorescent under blue light), burned eggshell (Fig. 9), large burned mollusc shells and charred cereal grains or seeds.

Burned soil and constructional materials that only show reddening may be of domestic hearth origin. Strongly burned soil showing a loss of birefringence of the aluminium-silicate minerals (as in some potsherds) and quartz (and melted 'dewdrop'-shaped and bubbled vesicular quartz, with a loss of birefringence mirroring loss of crystalline structure) is more typical of industrial hearths when very high temperatures are reached  $(>850^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$  up to  $1713^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$  (Courty et al., 1989; Guelat et al., 1998; Berna et al., 2007; see also Mathieu & Stoops, 1972; Angelucci, 2008) (Fig. 8B).

Experiments employing a combination of open fires and furnaces with bellows showed kaolinite was lost and smectite suffered dehydroxylation and partial vitrification at  $500 - 700^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , quartz was transformed at  $1000 - 1200^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  to a glaze-like (glassy) phase and to cristobalite at  $1300^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  (Berna et al., 2007). Salt working typically employs low-temperature fires to boil brine, sometimes using salt-rich coastal sediments. Hearth surfaces (Fig. 8A) and briquetage become rubefied because of this processing, but development of a high-temperature glazed surface has also been observed for briquetage used as bellows plates (Macphail et al., 2012). The 'redhills' of Essex, United Kingdom, and salt working levels at Marco Gonzalez have developed from the rapid accumulation of burned tidal flat sediments used to extract brine (Graham et al., 2017; Macphail et al., 2017b) (Fig. 8A).

This shows a sequence of a lime floor constructed over debris which includes pottery fragments (P; probable Coconut Walk ware used in salt working). The lime floor surface is weakly rubefied from the use of small fires to heat brine; ash and other fuel waste (charcoal) occurs above, where there is a dump of limestone (L) and burned sediments (BS) used in brine extraction (Graham et al., 2017; Macphail et al., 2017b) (NL, scale bar length is  $1\mathrm{cm}$ ).

Different activities can be implied from inclusions of leather and non-ferrous metal materials (craftwork), bark and wood (wood working or construction), exotic igneous rock fragments (grindstones) and exotic limestone and sandstone associated with lime plasters and mortar (construction). Thus, predominantly domestic and industrial spaces and areas within structures that are employed to house domesticated animals can be differentiated on the basis of the associated archaeological materials (Cammas et al., 1996; Macphail et al., 1997, 2004, 2007; Shahack-Gross et al., 2004a, 2005; Milek, 2006; Banerjea et al., 2015).

# 3.2 Organic Waste Materials

Animal and human faecal waste is a source of phosphate and organic matter. Although bat guano (Shahack-Gross et al., 2004b) and bone-rich bird guano remains are typical of some natural cave sediments (Macphail & Goldberg, 1999; Goldberg & Macphail, 2012), scavenging by birds can be similarly recorded from occupation areas and cremation- and excavation-associated deposits where bodies were exposed (Macphail & Crowther, 2008; Macphail & Goldberg, 2017, pp. 487-489; see also Angelucci 2008).

Dung of herbivores (cattle, sheep, goats, horses) can be ubiquitous: in structures, fields and trackways where finely fragmented residues can occur alongside phosphate-enriched inwashed clays and neoformed iron, calcium or phosphate nodules (Engelmark & Linderholm, 2008; Macphail, 2011; Macphail et al., 2017a); manured fields may include articulated phytoliths that can be identified and counted in thin section (Devos et al., 2013). Herbivore dung can normally be differentiated from that of omnivores (pigs, humans) and carnivores (dogs, hyenas) (Courty et al., 1989, 1994; Horwitz & Goldberg, 1989; Macphail, 2000; Goldberg et al., 2009a).

Oxidised dung remains, especially from oivicaprids, may be rich in 'faecal spherulites', formed of calcite or monohydrocalcite (Brochier, 1983; Brochier et al., 1992; Canti, 1999; Shahack-Gross et al., 2004a, 2004b; Shahack-Gross, 2011). However, not all calcite spherulites  $(< 20\mu \mathrm{m})$  found in archaeological sediments are necessarily of faecal origin. Calcite spherulites have been experimentally obtained from recrystallisation of Tamarix aphylla wood ash (Shahack-Gross & Finkelstein, 2008). Clearly, the simple presence of calcite spherulites is inconclusive evidence for stabiling or animal stocking. In tell sites, individual spherulite occurrences can be ubiquitous, and only where they are concentrated in high numbers do they have significance. Even in this case, it is their organisation within the soil microfabric and relationship with other constituents that allow any proper interpretation of their occurrence (in situ and microstratified stabiling layers with identifiable dung remains, dumps, background herbivore presence, trampled concentrations) (Binder et al., 1993; Macphail et al., 1997, 2017a; Matthews et al., 1997; Sordoillet, 1997, 2009; Boschian & Montagnari-Kokelji, 2000; Shahack-Gross et al., 2003, 2004a, 2004b; Angelucci et al., 2009).

# 3.2.1 Herbivore Dung

Herbivore dung dominated by Poaceae remains (grasses and cereals) is not universal, and both ovicaprids and cattle were stalled or overwintered on a diet of woodland 'leaf hay'

during prehistory in Swiss lake village sites (e.g., fir) and in Mediterranean rock shelters (e.g., oak). In the latter case, ashed stabling deposits record layered deposits of dark brown twig wood 'stable floor' layers and grey layers of ashed dung and fodder that were first fully identified at the Arene Candide (Italy) and Pendimoun (France) caves (Courty et al., 1991; Binder et al., 1993; Macphail & Goldberg, 1995). Subsequent investigations of numerous Neolithic animal management sites (e.g., France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland) have confirmed these findings (Brochier, 1996; Macphail et al., 1997; Sordoillet, 1997; Boschian & Montagnari-Kokelji, 2000; Akeret & Rentzel, 2001; Angelucci et al., 2009; Polodíaz et al., 2016). Calcium oxalates, their pseudomorphs and burned (blackened) residues are abundant, while phytoliths are rare. Charred twig wood, leaves and bark, and calcite ash pseudomorphic after the original wood cell structure are also visible, alongside ashed herbivore coprolites. It can also be noted that dung residues can contribute to grass ash (see Fig. 7); in some cases, recognisable fragments of ashed dung pellets can be preserved.

Herbivore dung is dominated by poorly digested plant tissues and small amounts of amorphous organic matter and organic phosphate staining that is normally pale to dark brown under PPL and blackish brown under OIL. Cattle often produce dung with microlayered 'long' plant fragments, whereas sheep/goats produce rounded pellets with stained margins and a convoluted structure formed from 'short' plant fragments reflecting how these animals differently process a grass and cereal diet; herbivores are efficient at digesting cellulose and hence this material suffers a loss of birefringence as part of the humification process (Courty et al., 1994; Akeret & Rentzell, 2001; Macphail et al., 2004). Experimental and ethnoarchaeological stabling and animal compounds from the United Kingdom and Africa have demonstrated these differences (Macphail & Goldberg, 1995; Shahack-Gross et al., 2003, 2008; Shahack-Gross, 2011).

Stabling features include thin layers of phytolith-dominated dung residues resulting from stabling within buildings, which had at first been misidentified as plaster layers before a thin section study was carried out (Shahack-Gross et al., 2005). Compacted dung enriched in liquid animal waste can form phosphate-enriched layers and even cemented crusts (Heathcote, 2002), and in this process carbonates are partially transformed to Ca-phosphates (Shahack-Gross et al., 2003) on the floors of stables (e.g., as carbonate-substituted hydroxylapatite; Macphail et al., 2004, 2006b). These crusts have a finely laminated character because of the horizontal compaction of grass stems (and cereal remains) and the long, articulated phytoliths that characterise these plant remains; as humification continues, these phytoliths become more visible but in such crusts remain articulated as  $>1$ -mm-size lengths (Macphail & Cruise, 2001). In some cases, they occur within a finely dotted yellowish brown cement that is autofluorescent under blue light when hydroxylapatite is present. How these stabling features preserve relates to the type of dung, whether it was burned or not, and overall environmental conditions and ageing (Figs. 10 and 11).

At Atzmaut rock shelter in the Negev Desert (Rosen et al., 2005; Macphail & Crowther, 2008), recent goat dung is dominated by fragmented pellets and plant fragments, with organic material being more dominant than phosphate, whereas compressed, aged and

oxidised Bronze Age stable floor layers are phosphate enriched, and interference colours are moderately high because faecal spherulites are no longer obscured by organic matter. Matthews et al. (1997) report interbedded lenses of dung pellet fragments and digested plant remains from stables. At 1st millennium BC Lattes, southern France, pure, bedded dung of horses or cattle is believed to have accumulated under humid exterior conditions, whereas dung bedded with quartz grains accumulated in dry conditions (Cammas, 1994).

Both layered dung from cattle and fragments of ovicaprid dung are reported from a Swiss Gallo-Roman stable at Brig Gliss VS, but here the stabling deposits were accidentally burned in situ (Guelat et al., 1998). This is not an uncommon occurrence where dung layers become generally strongly 'blackened' and 'browned' (see also Macphail et al., 2004). A burning temperature of c.  $900^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  was estimated from the presence of vitrified phytoliths at Brig Gliss VS (Guelat et al., 1998).

Dung fragments can also be preserved by iron, and iron and manganese mineralisation in which poor but still recognisable pseudomorphs are formed in intermittently waterlogged conditions (Macphail et al., 1998) or they can be completely preserved by anaerobic conditions (e.g., Akeret & Rentzel, 2001; Ismail-Meyer & Rentzel, 2004). Phosphate-cemented dung or stable floor fragments preserve well and occur in middens and manured soils; dung itself has been employed as constructional material, for example, to line wattle walls.

In an experimental manured plot in northern Sweden, characterised by a high proportion of organic phosphate, recognisable herbivore manure occurs as fragments (4 mm) of compact humified layered plant fragments within an amorphous organic matter matrix that resembles stable floor crust material (Macphail et al., 2004, 2006b; Goldberg & Macphail, 2006). Similar fragments occur in experimentally manured fields at Butser Ancient Farm and in Iron Age to Viking Period cultivated soils in Denmark, Norway and Sweden, and these still retain high proportions of their phosphate as organic phosphate from these dung inputs; dung fragments also occur in a well fill associated with one a mixed farming system (Engelmark & Linderholm, 1996; Goldberg & Macphail, 2006; Viklund et al., 2013). Such manuring raised the level of biological activity compared with the natural soil, usually manifesting itself as an increase in the amount and size of organic and organo-mineral excrements compared with a previous dominance of extremely thin organic excrements. In present-day northern Norway, when virgin and cultivated soils were treated with cattle slurry, the cultivated sandy soil developed an increase in fine material content (Sveistrup et al., 1995). The surface of the virgin soil became compacted, however, and examples of slurry coatings and panning were observed for all soils. In archaeological soils, such modern slurry coatings need to be identified as contamination (Viklund et al., 2013). On the other hand, phosphatic void coatings due to seepage from cess pits can be penecontemporaneous (Macphail, 2016b; Macphail & Goldberg, 2017, pp. 458-461).

# 3.2.2 Pig Dung

Pig dung may contain both large amounts of plant tissues and amorphous organic matter and organic phosphate, along with calcium oxalates from partially digested plant material and ingested silt (Courty et al., 1989, 1994). The latter is sometimes also present in herbivore dung and found intercalated in laminated stabling crusts. Pigs fed on a husk-rich cereal feed at 'West Stow Anglo-Saxon Village', Suffolk, United Kingdom,

produced a moderately phosphate-enriched trampled surface soil in their enclosure where cereal husks occur as horizontally oriented inclusions; the immediately underlying soil contains neoformed amorphous Fe-P-Ca nodules (Macphail & Crowther, 2011). The pig pasture at West Stow was churned by pigs forming heterogeneous soils; such mixing and microcolluviation was also reported from the 'medieval' farm at Lann-Gouh, Brittany, France (Gebhardt, 1995). Faecal spherulites have also been found in fresh wild boar and pig excrements (Brochier, 1996; Canti, 1999) (Figs. 12 and 13).

# 3.2.3 Dog Coprolites

Dogs and other canids scavenge and produce coprolites that can contain coarse bone fragments, including fish bone and fins (Matsui et al., 1996), as well as quartz silt that becomes embedded in a presumed hydroxylapatite cement (Fig. 14). This cement is commonly a fine dotted blackish grey (PPL) material, with undifferentiated b-fabric, white in OIL and strongly autofluorescent under blue light (Courty et al., 1989; Macphail, 2000). As reported for Ca-phosphate-cemented hyena coprolites, it is believed that trapped intestinal gas in dog coprolites can produce vesicles and that ingested fur or wool leaves narrow curved voids (Horwitz & Goldberg, 1989; Lewis, 1997; Larkin et al., 2000; Macphail & Goldberg, 2012). Where dogs scavenged sheep carcasses as evidenced by bone gnawing, there are wool-size curved voids in the coprolites; pollen analysis on both thin sections and prepared pollen samples shows that much cereal material was eaten, possibly from scavenged human faeces (Scaife, 2000; Cruise, personal communication). It can be noted here that when bone is digested by dogs (and by humans and birds, for example) it can become leached, losing birefringence and autofluorescence; when embedded in guano and/or cess, however, the edges of bone fragments may become phosphatised and display high autofluorescence (Courty et al., 1989; Macphail & Goldberg, 1999; Macphail & Crowther, 2008).

# 3.2.4 Human Coprolites

Human coprolites, as identified through nematode egg analysis (Kenward & Hall, 1995), may have a presumed hydroxylapatite matrix similar to that of dog coprolites but differ by normally being a yellowish colour (Courty et al., 1989; Goldberg et al., 2009a; Macphail, 2016b). They also often have a different content reflecting their omnivorous diet (both bone and plant remains occur), and they do not typically contain much clastic mineral material or coarse bone. As such, they are far more likely to include plant food fragments, such as legume testa and cereal material, including articulated phytolith-rich bran; thin sections of mummified intestinal contents found solely leguminous seed cases in some Chilean mummies (Macphail, 2016b) (Figs. 15 and 16). Here the cellulose of the seed cases is still birefringent, unlike the humified cellulose found in herbivore dung - herbivores being better adapted to digest cellulose compared with humans. Body stains and probable intestinal remains that autofluoresce in blue light have been found in an Iron Age grave in Norway where bands of vivianite can also mirror wooden coffin remains; both amorphous yellow (Ca-P) and reddish brown (Fe-Ca-P) body stains occur in the pelvic area of a warrior found in a boat grave near the Gokstad Mound (Macphail et al., 2013; Viklund et al., 2013).

Latrines contain mineralised cess, again with a probable carbonate hydroxylapatite composition (Fig. 17). Such waste can contain embedded cereal material of dietary origin, as well as sphagnum moss that was most likely used as toilet paper. Fine fragments of this type of latrine waste often occur as a regular component of Roman and Medieval beaten floors in the United Kingdom. Dumped toilet waste and seepage from

cess pits, like modern day sewage sludge, produces yellow amorphous infillings and nodules of Fe-Ca-phosphates, sometimes with neoformation of vivianite (Macphail, 2016b; see Karkanas & Goldberg, 2018). It is common to find phosphate-embedded charcoal, both in latrine waste and in fields, implying that such material – which may also include embedded ash – was used as a ‘night soil’ fertiliser worldwide (Henning & Macphail, 2004; Goldberg & Macphail, 2006).

# 4. Manufactured Materials

The study of manufactured materials in archaeology is commonly thought of as being a specialist field. However, archaeological sites often include fragments of pottery and other ceramic materials (e.g., roof tiles, pipes, kilns). These materials need to be distinguished routinely from natural rocks or debris, which provides clues to local industries (see Berna et al., 2007). In complex societies, the types of materials (e.g., lime and gypsum plasters), and how they have been applied (e.g., single coat vs several layers), can be indicative of the status of buildings or rooms and the associated social standing of the former occupants. The petrology of pottery has been well studied (Rice, 1987), and handmade pottery can be distinguished from wheel-made ceramics by, at low magnification comparing air-void patterns, general coarse particle distribution and general aspects of the groundmass, and at high magnification examining the morphology and arrangement of clay domains formed by the packing of clay- and silt-size particles and overall birefringence fabrics (Courty et al., 1989; Roux & Courty, 1998; Quinn, 2013). Neolithic pottery has commonly been manufactured using organic tempers and local soils and sediments (Spataro, 2002).

# 4.1 Stone Tools

Stone tools are probably the earliest worked material to be found in archaeological sites. Flint or chert is composed of microcrystalline quartz or chalcedony and is a common example of a natural rock material that flakes well to produce sharp-edged tools (Angelucci, 2010). Flint, which can occur in a variety of colours and lustres in the field, is normally colourless in thin section (Fig. 18), unless stained by iron oxides. It may occur as an exotic rock because of human importation. Other silicate-dominated rocks used for tools are quartzite and various volcanic rocks, such as rhyolites, basalts, or obsidian.

When burned, colourless flint can become greyish brown (PPL) (white in OIL), and cracks appear along with so-called pot-lidding of small hemispherical spalls that lack striking platforms (Andrefsky, 1998). Heating can also cause a change in texture resulting in a reduction in crystal size. Fire-altered cherts can be found with other heat-altered rocks in middens and burned rock mounds (e.g., Goldberg & Guy, 1996).

# 4.2 Plasters and Mortars

Lime- and gypsum-based plasters and mortar have been studied worldwide. Plaster floors are formed from layers of grey to greyish brown (PPL) micritic lime plaster that often includes unburned limestone components (Goren & Goldberg, 1991) and fine organic fragments, sometimes along with fine burned mineral material and charcoal (Matthews et al., 1996) (Fig. 19). Plaster is normally whitish in OIL. A comparison between experimental lime plaster and natural calcareous sediments (Karkanas, 2007) indicates that the most promising features for identifying lime are transitional textures of partially carbonised slaked lime (composed of poorly crystallised portlandite and mixtures of cryptocrystalline calcite) that can be observed in the lime lumps and the binding matrix cement. Well-formed calcitic groundmass and shrinkage cracks are also possible indicators of lime plasters (Karkanas, 2007). Fine charcoal and reddened burned mineral inclusions may also suggest the presence of burned lime.

Chalk, limestone and, in coastal areas where limestone is unavailable, shells have been burned to produce lime. For example, burned conch shell, of presumed limemaking origin, occurs in some New World Maya lime plasters on the island site of

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/568373a1-287b-42e4-864b-7188337e294d/f2eeeced8e462c4fc77f35e9b3ca2ccbd2444969118ccaa992d6b217e165f4b8.jpg)  
FIGURE 19 Manufactured lime plaster (Pre-Pottery Neolithic Yiftah El, Israel). Layers of very fine and sometime pure lime plaster, applied as cover of a floor; note very thin layers of finer plaster that cover a coarser layer in the middle and traces of fine organic matter from the manufacturing and mixing process (PPL, scale bar length  $0.5\mathrm{mm}$ ).

Marco Gonzalez, Belize (Macphail et al., 2017a; Graham et al., 2017); tempering material included high proportions of unburned shell, pottery fragments and siliceous marine tidal flat sediments, which had sometimes been burned. In Roman structures, a typical coarse/fine ratio for a plaster, or matrix within a coarse tempered mortar, is 60/40 (Stoops, 1984b; Macphail, 2003).

Plaster often shows very thin layers associated with the plastering process, carried out, for example, on brickearth walls or over mortared wall surfaces, ahead of painting (Pye, 2000/2001) (Fig. 20). Babylonian red floors had, in some cases, a 20-mm-thick supporting 'white' layer composed of a microcrystalline calcite cement and a temper of well-sorted  $(1 - 3\mathrm{mm})$  coarse sand to fine gravel, composed of quartz and feldspar, below a c. 6-mm-thick red surface layer. The latter is characterised by a similar temper, but the matrix is formed from microcrystalline calcite and hematite dust (Stoops & Stoops, 1994). Multiple plaster floors are considered as evidence of both ritual activity and level of social status, but contemporary floors in different domestic structures may show a varying composition, which was probably determined by the individual households (Karkanas & Efstratiou, 2009).

Fragments of plaster and mortar are common in the Roman to early Medieval dark earth of European cities and as weathering features in Maya sites of the New World (Macphail, 1994; Cammas, 2004; Straulino et al., 2013; Borderie et al., 2014; Graham et al., 2017) and within fills of tels (Matthews et al., 1996; Boivin & French, 1997/1998). In Europe, mortar may contain brick fragments and volcanic rock clasts, which may imply that they are hydraulic mortars because these are a source of neoformed aluminium silicates that cement this mortar type rather than simply being cemented by neoformed calcite. Similarly, it has been suggested that the Maya may also have used volcanic materials to produce pozzolanic plasters in mainland Belize (Villaseñor & Graham, 2010). However, the identification of neoformed aluminium silicates in hydraulic mortar requires X-ray diffraction analyses (e.g., Rentzel, 1998). In addition, relicts of calcium of aluminium hydrates are amorphous, featureless and optically isotropic in thin section (St John et al., 1998).

Hammerscale, iron slag and silt to coarse sand-size vesicular iron spheroids are evidence of industrial activities and may occur alongside fuel ash waste and high-temperature melted and fused soil; in the last, minerals may be altered, with quartz and feldspar, for example, losing their birefringence (Viklund et al., 2013, see Section 3.1) (see Fig. 8B). Opaque in transmitted light, hammerscale has a layered metallic edge, visible in OIL and SEM-BSE images, comprising an outer hematite layer and inner magnetite and wüstite (FeO) layers in some examples (Kresten & Hjärthner-Holdar, 2001). Iron slag is very dark (PPL) and has a typical vesicular void pattern. It includes optically isotropic areas, dark materials showing dendritic patterns (e.g., wüstite) and iron silicates such as fayalite  $\left(\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}_{2}\left(\mathrm{SiO}_{4}\right)\right)$ ; such patterns are strongly visible in SEM-BSE images (Kresten & Hjärthner-Holdar, 2001; Macphail, 2003). Iron slag and hammerscale also often occur as poorly preserved nodular material because of postdepositional gleying. Thin, angular iron flakes also occur in kitchen debris from the use of iron pots, and these can also be differentiated from iron-pan fragments by a metallic lustre under OIL, as confirmed by EDS testing (Macphail et al., 2016).

Non-ferrous metal and glass working also produce metal droplets ('prills') and 'glassy' furnace slags (Merkel, personal communication). Quantitative SEM-EDS and microprobe analyses are often necessary alongside optical microscopy. For example, petrographic analysis of a Bronze Age pit fill showed colourless to grey cassiterite aggregates  $(\mathrm{SnO}_2)$ , with characteristic high relief, high birefringence and extinction parallel to cleavage (Macphail & Crowther, 2008); blue-green aggregates in Roman London were identified as copper and tin working waste and associated corrosion products. Presumed bell-making activities in medieval Magdeburg also produced blue-green stained bronze droplets (Goldberg & Macphail, 2006).

A Cu-Pb alloy was found in trampled floor spreads at a medieval hospital, alongside strongly burned sediments (Fig. 21). In thin section, it was found to be a mainly opaque

material (PPL), with elsewhere generally very low interference colours, but with bright yellow and reddish colours in OIL. On the other hand, it was possible with the help of specialist archaeometallurgists to identify probable corroding lead fragments in Roman ashy dumps where pure lead is opaque, with a blackish lustre under OIL (Borderie et al., 2014). A coating of 'red' lead oxide is also opaque but reddish under OIL, while corrosion staining of the surrounding calcitic ashes also produced grey (PPL), high-order interference colours and white (OIL) lead carbonate.

# 5. Conclusions

An archaeological material is any matter that has been utilised or produced by humans or that formed as a by-product of their activities. Soil micromorphology, using optical microscopy and associated techniques, is one of the best methods for characterising and identifying archaeological materials, especially when they occur as microscopic fragments at archaeological sites. In fact, although bulk and microfossil studies can provide useful supporting information, often the data from these techniques can only really be properly understood when soil micromorphology is available. For example, some phytoliths can be understood better when unfragmented in thin section, while the exact nature of phosphate-enrichment in archaeological contexts can often be identified, as produced by in situ bone, ash or dung concentrations, or which only result from secondary phosphate accumulations. In addition, the identification of such microartefacts is an essential new tool for characterising archaeological contexts.

Archaeological materials include natural mineral and organic materials that have been used in their raw state (dung, flint, turf, tufa, wood) or as little-transformed material (earth-floors and walls, adobe and mud brick, leather), as well as fully manufactured products (iron, lime plaster, metal alloys). Other archaeological matter include waste from occupation, such as dung and mineralised coprolites from domestic animals, human waste (coprolites, cess), food (bone, cereal grains, eggshell, mollusc shell) and hearth remains (ash, charcoal, briquetage). Sites also produce strongly burned residual remains, fused ash, slag, vitrified ceramics, burned bone and flint, for example. As research continues, the number of identified archaeological materials continues to increase and permits an ever deeper understanding of different cultures and human activities through time. Clearly, it is also required to comprehend the nature of the archaeological context and type of deposit in which these materials occur. Such strategies can provide a fuller understanding of past human activities operating at the site.

# 1. Introduction

Soils have played an important role in Earth history since 3000 million years ago (Retallack, 1990; Retallack & Mindszenty, 1994). Primitive soils, which formed by weathering, appeared before vegetation developed (e.g., Driese et al., 2007). Later soils formed in conditions with different atmosphere compositions than those existing at present and with a different impact of cosmic events (e.g., Jones & Bo Lim, 2000).

Definitions of palaeosols vary widely. For Morrison (1977), palaeosols are soils of obvious antiquity, whereas Butzer (1971) defines them as ancient soils. For other authors, they are soils formed in a landscape of the past (Ruhe, 1965; Yaalon, 1971) or in a past environment (Yaalon, 1983). In this chapter, the term 'palaeosoil' is restricted to buried soils of any age, for which functioning was totally or partially inhibited by burial. We apply it also to truncated soils, even if just a thin basal interval is preserved. Relict soils are defined as soils belonging to the present-day soil cover but which have characteristics inherited from the past, resulting from different environmental conditions than those occurring today.

The aims and history of palaeopedology differ from those of pedology (Fedoroff & Courty, 2002). Palaeosols have been approached with different objectives. Many authors (e.g., Kukla & An Zhisheng, 1989) considered palaeosols as stratigraphic markers in continental sequences, without attempting to analyze them, whereas others considered some layers in such sequences as palaeosols just because of their colour. Analysis and interpretation of palaeosols with methods used in pedology, including soil micromorphology, began at a relatively late stage (e.g., Fedoroff & Goldberg, 1982). The palaeoenvironmental significance of palaeosols has only recently been taken into account (e.g., Fedoroff et al., 1990; Kemp, 1999; Felix-Henningsen & Mauz, 2004; Ferraro et al., 2004). Proxy indicators for defining climatic characteristics under which palaeosols have developed have been used by some authors (e.g., Wang & Follmer, 1998; Retallack, 2005a).

Soil micromorphology is at present commonly applied in investigations of palaeosols and relict soils. Mücher and Morozova (1983) have presented a foundation for the micromorphological description of palaeosols and related sediments, whereas Fedoroff et al. (1990) drafted keys for the recognition of environmental changes in the past. Most papers deal with Quaternary palaeosols, especially those formed during the last interglacial, the last glacial cycle and the Holocene (e.g., Kemp et al., 1994; Cremaschi & Trombino, 1998; Kemp, 1998; Srivastava & Parkash, 2002), but pre-Quaternary palaeosols have also been studied (e.g., Tate & Retallack, 1995; McCarthy et al., 1998; Driese et al., 2007). Micromorphological analyses of palaeosols often show differences with present-day soil functioning. Elementary attributes of pedogenic facies of the past are similar to present ones, but they can be different by showing a higher degree of development or by the presence of assemblages of pedofeatures unknown in modern soils. Pedofeatures specific of pedogenesis of the past are rare. Micromorphological studies reveal also that almost all palaeosols were affected by processes of in situ reworking, erosion, transport,

deposition and allochthonous aggradation (e.g., Retallack, 2005b; Sephton et al., 2005), which are often underestimated or not even recognised by other observations.

Examination in thin sections of well-developed soils, especially those dating back to the Pleistocene, nearly always reveals the presence of relict characteristics (e.g., Fedoroff, 1997). In some relict soils, such as Ferralsols, the history of the soil is almost totally wiped out, but in others, such as calcretes and ferricretes (e.g., Achyuthan & Fedoroff, 2008), the history is preserved to a large extent.

In this chapter, an interdisciplinary approach is used, dealing with analysis of sets of interacting entities and the interactions within those systems (systems analysis). Such an approach is commonly utilised by sedimentary petrologists (e.g., Humbert, 1976a, 1976b).

# 2. Methodology

# 2.1 Recognition of Palaeosols and Relict Soils

A first task when investigating continental sequences is to decide whether the layers defined in the field as palaeosols are soils that formed in situ, transported soil materials (pedosediments), or something else (e.g., McCarthy, 2002). In situ soils are characterised in thin sections by a continuous pedogenic facies recognised by at least one of the following features: (i) undisturbed features resulting from soil biological activity, such as passage features and channels with root residues or excrements; (ii) a pedogenic microstructure; (iii) a pedogenic b-fabric; or (iv) one or more types of undisturbed pedofeatures. In contrast, pedosediments are recognised by (i) an absence of in situ biogenic features, but the common presence of tissue and charcoal fragments; (ii) a massive microstructure, and occasionally a structure dominated by packing of rounded aggregates; or (iii) sedimentary features (see also Mücher et al., 2010). Some layers which seem to be free of pedogenic characteristics in the field can show a pedogenic facies in thin sections. For example, the typic Late Pleistocene loess layers of the Loess Plateau of China consist entirely of passage features and various types of excrements (Guo, 1990). Consequently, this examination must be extended to underlying and overlying horizons or layers to characterise variations in pedogenic facies, identify other possible types of facies, compare groundmass characteristics and identify features related to erosion and aggradation.

Palaeosols are very rarely preserved as complete and undisturbed profiles. Some discontinuities are easy to identify in the field, such as truncations, stone lines and the superimposition of allochthonous materials on pedogenic horizons. The field diagnosis can be considerably improved by examination in thin sections, which can reveal discontinuities in pedofeatures, as well as features due to erosion, in situ reworking (see Fig. 15), mass transportation, or minor aggradation (e.g., accumulation of aeolian dust). It also contributes to the determination of which in situ horizon or horizons are part of the investigated palaeosol, on the basis of its pedogenic facies.

Palaeosols commonly alternate with sediments, as in loess sequences (e.g., Kukla & An Zhisheng, 1989) or in deltas and alluvial plains (Srivastava & Parkash, 2002), creating palaeosoil-sediment sequences termed 'pedocomplexes' (e.g., Morrison, 1977; Feng & Wang, 2005). The palaeosols can be (i) juxtaposed, i.e., lying in a close vertical succession, without penetration of pedofeatures of the overlying into the underlying palaeosoil; (ii) superimposed, i.e., with penetration of pedofeatures of the overlying into the underlying palaeosoil; or (iii) cumulic, i.e., palaeosols in which a type of pedofeature (in general a textural pedofeature) occurs without significant change in a thick homogeneous horizon (Fig. 1) (e.g., Yin & Guo, 2006). An example of a well-studied pedocomplex is the marine isotope stage 5 (MIS 5) pedocomplex, also known as the Eemian pedocomplex, that is present throughout the loess belt of the northern hemisphere, characterisation of which includes micromorphological analyses (e.g., Fedoroff & Goldberg, 1982; Guo, 1990; Kemp et al., 1995, 1997, 2001; Stremme, 1998; Bronger, 2003; Chen et al., 2003; Chlachula et al., 2004). In the most complete sections, this pedocomplex consists of three juxtaposed palaeosols, but in some regions they merge into a single soil profile in which no boundaries or transitions are recognised, even in thin sections (e.g., Xifeng loess section, China; Guo, 1990). Pedocomplexes are also frequent in karstic dolines, for which some micromorphological data are available (Boulet et al., 1986; Kuhn & Hilgers, 2005).

5. the whole soil profile consists dominantly of inherited micro-fragments (e.g. Ferralsols, Oxisols)

Relict soils can be subdivided into (i) soils with relict characteristics, which cannot be detected in the field; (ii) soils with discrete, randomly distributed inherited pedofeatures; (iii) soils with an ancient truncated base whose age can reach millions of years, covered by partially or entirely allochthonous materials; (iv) totally relict soils, except for the presence of fissures and channels in which water circulates and in which living organisms are active; and (v) soils consisting of microfragmented relict soil materials, e.g., small fragments of ferruginous features as in Ferralsols (Fig. 2).

Relict or inherited characteristics can be (i) discrete pedofeatures characterised by sharp boundaries and by a relict groundmass, embedded in a functioning groundmass; (ii) a disturbed or fragmented pedogenic facies embedded in a different soil material; or (iii) an undisturbed pedogenic facies which is unrelated to present-day soil-forming conditions, e.g., a platy microstructure due to ice lensing in a deep horizon of a mid-latitude soil. The structure of the parent material can be preserved in the truncated base (isalterite; Delvigne, 1998), or it can be reworked but without major aggradation of allochthonous material (alloterite; Delvigne, 1998). An example of deciphering relict soils can be found in Achyuthan and Fedoroff (2008).

# 2.2 Reconstruction of History

When reconstructing the history of soils of the past and deciphering their environmental significance, one has to bear in mind a few basic concepts: (i) the evolution of soils at geologic timescales was discontinuous; (ii) the memory of soils is palimpsest-like; and (iii) as a consequence of discontinuous soil evolution, pedofeatures and other attributes of soils exposed for long periods are organised according to hierarchies.

# 2.2.1 Discontinuous Soil Evolution

The theory of biorhexistasy, based on field observations, describes climatic conditions necessary for periods favourable for soil development, called biostasy, separated by episodes of soil erosion, called rhexistasy (Erhart, 1956). The concept of the pedogenic phase, which is derived from the biostasy phase, was formulated later (Fedoroff & Courty, 2002, 2005). A pedogenic phase is defined as a period of soil development induced by an invariant soil-forming process, characterised by a unique pedogenic facies (Fig. 3). For example, a Luvisol with a Bt horizon characterised by microlaminated clay coatings and infillings or, as illustrated in Figure 4A, a Kastanozem with a completely bioturbated B horizon characterised by passage features and infillings with

The sequence of events is as follows: (i) loess deposition; (ii) calcite accretion in the form of discrete features; and (iii) clay illuviation and partial dissolution of the micritic nodule. The brown clayey aggregates probably belong to the clay illuviation phase, whereas the black aggregates are related to an event requiring further investigation.

excrements, must be considered as monophase soils. A rhexistasic episode following a pedogenic phase can be characterised by, for example, loess aggradation or in situ soil reworking. This is usually followed by a pedogenic phase similar to the preceding phase of soil formation. A cycle consists of a pedogenic phase and a rhexistasic episode (Fig. 3). In Chinese loess, such cycles are repeated many times (Kukla & An Zhisheng, 1989). An example of polyphase evolution is given in Figure 4B. Cycles also exist in relict soils, for which they are more difficult to identify. They can be impossible to detect, as in most Ferralsols (see Fig. 2). A biostasy period should correspond to a unique pedogenic phase, but biphasic and even three-phase palaeosols without any rhexistasic attribute are quite common. For example, two successive pedogenic phases are recognised in calcareous vertic palaeosols of Madeira, specifically Vertisol development followed by carbonate enrichment (Goodfriend et al., 1996). Duration and intensity of pedogenic phases can be unequal, some corresponding to extremely strongly developed profiles, for instance, relict soils on high terraces of the Rhone valley (Bornand, 1978) and palaeosols assigned to MIS 14-15 in China (Guo, 1990). In contrast to the latter, palaeosols of MIS 11, 9 and 7 in China are moderately to weakly developed.

According to the classical model (Jenny, 1941; Yaalon, 1983), soils develop toward a steady state, balanced with existing factors of soil formation. If the evolution of palaeosols and relict soils is considered to be discontinuous, this concept must be regarded with caution. Some relict soils seem to have reached a steady state, but close

investigation at microscopic scales shows that these soils have been affected to some extent by erosion, transport and sediment aggradation during rhexistasic episodes. For instance, the upper horizons of Ferralsols in northeastern Argentina have been affected by complete reworking during episodes of aeolian activity (Iriondo & Krohling, 1997). The notion of threshold, referring to a fluctuation in soil development resulting from internal factors (e.g., Ewing et al., 2006), must also be considered with caution, as it probably reflects a modification of environmental parameters in some cases.

# 2.2.2 Soil Memory

Targulian and Sokolova (1996) and Targulian and Goryachkin (2004) defined 'soil memory' as an assemblage of persistent pedogenic solid-phase properties, in the form of a palimpsest-like type of memory. This concept of soil memory for palaeosols and relict soils can be enlarged, including the following items (Fedoroff & Courty, 2005):

- assemblage of persistent pedogenic properties, which includes pedofeatures and microstructure; these properties have to be regrouped into pedogenic facies (if more than one is present), and a hierarchy has to be established between them;  
- measurement of soil magnetic susceptibility and other magnetic properties; soil magnetic minerals are too fine-grained to be identified by optical microscopy, but they have been observed using electron microscopy (e.g., Perkins, 1996; Grimley & Arruda, 2007); most investigations of magnetic susceptibility of palaeosols are conducted without using microscopic techniques (e.g., Maher et al, 2003);  
- observation of vegetation and fauna remnants such as pollen grains, phytoliths, charcoal fragments, shells and insect cuticles; these remnants have to be separated from the soil mass rather than studied in thin sections;  
- nature of the coarse mineral fraction (abundance, distribution, sorting, degree of weathering, external morphology) and its variation through the profile; quartz and zircon can be used for detecting depletion and aggradation (e.g., Brimhall et al., 1991); and  
- identification of possible sedimentary features and features caused by soil reworking (Mücher & Morozova, 1983; Mücher et al., 2010).

The palimpsest-like type of soil memory refers to the notion that the memory is constantly renewed, even when the soil is buried (e.g., decay of organic components), but that a part of the pedogenic assemblage is preserved through time. Soil micromorphology is the most efficient method for identification and reconstruction of assemblages which are partly erased, degraded or superimposed by secondary constituents. The following principles can be considered:

- The effects of soil functioning, and consequently of environmental events, are maximal at the soil surface and at near-surface levels, and they decrease sharply with depth. In deep horizons the soil memory is incomplete and selective. For example, superimposed silty and clayey coatings and infillings at the top of a Bt

horizon tend to merge progressively into microlaminated features at the bottom of this horizon, and they are replaced by coatings without microlamination in deep C horizons (Targulian et al., 1974). Consequently, the accuracy of the registration of climatic fluctuations tends to decrease with depth.

- The soil memory is renewed rapidly in surface and near-surface horizons, but it is preserved for a long time in deeper horizons, especially in horizons which are out of reach of soil mesofauna and macrofauna. Ice lens microstructures dating from the Late Pleistocene can be observed in Luvisols on loess at depths of  $70 - 80\mathrm{cm}$  in the Paris basin (Fedoroff & Courty, 2005).  
- The depth of occurrence of a pedofeature within a profile varies with the type of soil-forming processes, climate factors and related soil water regimes. Biogenic processes are concentrated near the soil surface, whereas clay illuviation usually occurs at intermediate depth in B horizons, and effects of hydrolysis are detected in the weathering zone.  
- The resistance of pedofeatures and other soil attributes to ageing is very variable. The most susceptible to ageing are excrement features, followed in order by silty textural features, microlaminated clay coatings or infillings, and finally nodules rich in iron oxides (Fedoroff & Courty, 2002). Continuous cemented horizons (duricrusts), such as calccrete, ferricrete, gypsum and silcrete, have played a specific role in conservation of relict soils because of their resistance to erosion.

Stable and humid climatic phases tend to be overemphasised in the soil memory, whereas the registration of shorter and drier phases can be totally absent. During humid phases, water percolating regularly in great amounts favours illuviation to great depth. For instance, thick well-developed relict Luvisols on Middle Pleistocene terraces in the Rhone valley are characterised by thick red clay coatings and infillings distributed throughout an argillic horizon with a thickness of a few metres, whereas registration of juxtaposed or superimposed later pedological phases is minimal (Bornand, 1978).

In polyphase palaeosols and relict soils, the memory of the first phase is erased to a variable extent during the following phase. In a first approximation, the degree of memory obliteration is correlated with the duration of soil functioning. Various cases of soil memory preservation are presented in Figure 2. In this figure, the soil memory is best preserved in case 4, it is not easily detectable in case 1, and the relevant features are too fine for observation by optical microscopy in case 5 (microfragmentation).

Micromorphological analysis of the memory of a palaeosoil at the level of a thin section consists of the following steps:

- identifying all pedofeatures and other soil attributes present, using, for instance, the system of Bullock et al. (1985) and Stoops (2003), separating autochthonous and allochthonous features, grouping them into types, and characterising the assemblage of each type;

- grouping features into pedogenic facies, which correspond to the total of all pedofeatures and other soil attributes occurring simultaneously under constant environmental conditions;  
- examining the groundmass to detect features caused by erosion or sedimentation; and  
- establishing a hierarchy between the different pedogenic facies, including erosional and sedimentary features if necessary.

# 2.2.3 Systems Analysis of Polygenetic Palaeosols and Soils

Systems analysis can be applied for deciphering and interpreting polygenetic palaeosols and soils at microscopic levels. The procedure is the following: (i) identify all features (pedogenic as well as sedimentary); (ii) regroup similar features in facies; (iii) order the facies in sequences of events (establishment of a hierarchy; Humbert, 1976a); and (iv) interpret from a pedological-sedimentological viewpoint each facies as well as the transition between facies. In palaeosols and relict soils, a hierarchy can exist between all types of pedofeatures (e.g., textural and crystallitic; see Fig. 4B) and other attributes such as features resulting from erosion and sediments aggradation. Each type of pedofeature is considered to define a pedogenic phase, a period during which climate parameters are supposed to have been constant. A hierarchy must first be established at the level of the thin section and then extended to the palaeosol as a whole and eventually to the catena.

In relict soils, establishment of hierarchies requires at first a separation of inherited features from those formed in present-day conditions throughout the profile. Inherited features can then be subdivided into simple and complex (e.g., pisoliths; see Fig. 11) and into in situ, reworked and transported. Features resulting from erosion and aggradation of allochthonous materials must be identified. If they are present, their relationships with pedofeatures have to be determined. Pedofeatures can be pre-, syn- or posterosional and pre-, syn- or post-agradational.

# 3. Common Types of Hierarchies

We present here the most common hierarchies of textural, ferruginous and calcitic features and the related facies. Examples of siliceous features and facies can be found in Summerfield (1983), Milnes et al. (1991), Milnes and Thiry (1992), Thiry (1999) and Poetsch (2004). Inherited gypsum crystals and crystal intergrowths, and less frequently barite and celestite occurrences, can be present in palaeosols and relict soils, but they do not form complex assemblages in which hierarchies can be recognised, except if they are associated with calcitic features.

Partially or totally dissolved gypsum crystals and crystal intergrowths, identified by their preserved external forms, are common in palaeosols of arid and semiarid regions (Guo, 1990; Sullivan & Koppi, 1993). For more soluble salts, the lifetime of their occurrence is generally too short to be preserved as part of a hierarchy (e.g., Hamdi-Aissa, 2001).

# 3.1 Textural Features

The following types of occurrences involving one or two kinds of textural features are the most common:

- only one type of textural feature (e.g., microlaminated clay coatings), the absence of hierarchy (Fig. 5, case 1); in general some of these features are deformed or burrowed by soil fauna (e.g., small fragments of clay coatings incorporated in excrements), whereby the two processes (illuviation and faunal activity) are synchronous; such a facies characterise monophase soils;  
- juxtaposed and concordant features (e.g., parallel lamination in coatings) (Fig. 5, case 2), which implies that two different illuvial phases occurred successively, without erosion or another abrupt event separating stages with different environmental conditions (e.g., replacement of a conifer forest by deciduous vegetation); such a facies characterises biphase soils;  
- juxtaposed but discordant features (e.g., non-parallel lamination in coatings or cross-bedding) (Fig. 5, case 3), which means that a moderate interruption occurred between the different illuvial phases, during a rhexistasic episode; such a facies also characterises biphasic soils;  
- unrelated features (e.g., different types of clay coatings in different sets of voids) (Fig. 5, case 4), which implies that moderate soil disturbance took place between the two illuvial phases;  
- one type of feature occurring in the form of fragments dispersed in the ground-mass (clay coatings fragments), whereas an undisturbed feature (clay coatings) covers the sides of voids (Fig. 5, case 5) or coats the fragmented feature, both meaning that Luvisol development was followed by disruption of the Luvisol (e.g., by mass transportation), followed in turn by a new illuvial phase, similar to the first.

Hierarchies of three or more kinds of textural features (Fig. 7A) also occur quite frequently.

The hierarchy of textural features which is established in the horizon appearing in the field as the palaeosoil or its key horizon should be compared with the hierarchy in the underlying and overlying horizons or layers (Fig. 6). Relationships between illuvial facies in these horizons or layers, within a single profile, can be for instance:

- Textural features (clay coatings) that are undisturbed in the key horizon (Fig. 6, case 1) occur as fragments in the overlying horizon (Fig. 6, case 2), which means that the palaeosoil was truncated and then covered by reworked pedogenic material derived from the palaeosoil.  
- A textural feature (clay coating) both occurs in the key horizon and penetrates into the underlying horizon (Fig. 6, case 3), which has to be interpreted as an illuvial phase able to penetrate the underlying horizon.

FIGURE 7 Hierarchy of textural features. (A) Layered deposit showing the following hierarchy, from the ferruginous nodule to the void: (i) whitish grey clayey mass; (ii) irregular, red clayey laminae with embedded reddish brown aggregates; (iii) reddish and whitish microlaminae; (iv) packing of reddish brown aggregates; and (v) red clay microlaminae (nodular horizon of a laterite profile, Dogon lowlands, Mali) (PPL). The whitish grey mass corresponds to a high groundwater stand, probably in relation with a humid climate, whereas the following layer indicates a well-drained soil and the third one corresponds to a new phase of high groundwater levels; the reddish brown aggregates again suggest a well-drained soil, whereas the quartz grains, especially abundant splinters, indicate an aeolian episode; the red clay laminae correspond to a well-drained soil in a stable landscape. (B) Rounded silt capping, around an aggregate embedded in a groundmass affected by clay eluviation, from a layer just above a fragmented argic horizon (see Fig. 15) (Po valley, northern Italy) (PPL). The feature is inherited from a cold episode.

4, 7a, 8). Fine silt and clay coatings in fissures occur as an extension in another form of cappings that are present at higher levels, whereas disturbed reddish clayey coatings and infillings belong to two illuvial phases. Such assemblages of textural features commonly occur in loess that is strongly affected by soil development, e.g., in northern Italy, where loess aggradation was moderate and where climatic factors were favourable for illuviation even during cold periods (Cremaschi, 1991).

Different textural feature types organised according to a well-expressed hierarchy can merge with greater depth into a single type. Such assemblage can be observed in relict soils developed on deeply karstified limestone (Atalay, 1997; Fedoroff, 1997). One type of textural feature can be present throughout a very thick horizon (e.g., Yin & Guo, 2006).

# 3.2 Ferruginous Features

Horizons characterised by ferruginous nodules, pisoliths and continuous crusts (ferricretes or laterites), corresponding to ferric, plinthic, petroplinthic and pisoplinthic diagnostic horizons of the World Reference Base (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006) appear to consist in thin sections of a great variety of ferruginous features and facies assembled according to various hierarchies (Delvigne, 1998; Stoops & Marcelino, 2010), which are mainly inherited. The main types are described below.

A first type is iron oxide impregnations of an autochthonous material, which are either continuous or discontinuous in the form of mottles (Fig. 9, case 1.1). The coarse material can consist of gravel that represents the primary ferricrete (Fig. 9, case 1.2). A hierarchy is usually absent in both types. These forms should be considered as inherited, based on their location in the profile and their relationships with present-day groundwater levels. Discontinuous and continuous cementation result from in situ accretion of iron oxides, which occurred during a period of high but seasonally fluctuating groundwater rich in chelates (Schwertmann, 1985). Both types have to be considered as monophase plinthite, or as monophase petroplinthite if it is petrified. The host material is supposed to be free from ferruginous grains and gravels.

Ferruginous nodules characterised by sharp boundaries and a random distribution, in a different host material (Fig. 9, case 2), indicate severe reworking or erosion of a plinthitic soil, of which the fine fraction has been reworked or carried away and the mottles have become rounded. In this way, the soil has lost its less resistant parts while the most resistant constituents were preserved in the form of nodules. The nodules in such a horizon are thus inherited. In nodular facies that formed in situ, nodules are uniform in morphology and size, whereas in the case of transported material the facies consists of nodules of different types and dimensions.

Nodular horizons (Fig. 8) are frequently characterised by two and even more types of nodules between which a precise hierarchy cannot be established. Red, black and brown nodules have been described for a nodular horizon of a relict Plinthosol in Youth Island, Cuba (Gonzalez, 1991). The red nodules impregnate the same clayey material as red mottles that formed in situ at the base of the profile. From bottom to top of the profile, reddening of the nodules increases, their boundaries become sharper, their size decreases, and their shape becomes rounded. The red nodules undoubtedly belong to the in situ profile, or they may have been transported from a similar profile higher on the slope. The black nodules are opaque, masking the impregnated material. They appear to consist of pure oxides, and they contain abundant polyconcave vugs, partly coated by gibbsite crystals. Black nodules do not exist at present in any soils of the study area. Consequently, it is assumed that they were formed in Plinthosols, developed during a period with very high rainfall, favouring alteration. These Plinthosols were later completely eroded, whereby the resistant black nodules were preserved and scattered on the soil surface. The brown nodules are in fact pisoliths, as discussed below.

Ferruginous impregnation of the interstitial material of a nodular facies, usually in the form of bridges between the nodules (Fig. 9, case 3), has to be considered as a two-phase ferricrete. A rise of a fluctuating water table in a nodular horizon is responsible for such secondary ferruginous aggradation. Fragments of this type of two-phase ferricrete can be embedded in a new ferruginous impregnation (Fig. 9, case 4), producing a three-phase ferricrete.

Pisoliths, which are common in surface horizons in the tropics (Gonzalez, 1991; Achyuthan & Fedoroff, 2008), consist of a nucleus and a cortex (Delvigne, 1998), which have to be considered as being a part of a hierarchy (Figs. 10 and 11). The nature of the

The nodules were formed as part of a continuous or semicontinuous ferricrete, during a single phase characterised by a fluctuating water table; the ferricrete was subsequently disjointed and only the nodules were preserved; the sequence of events recorded for the material between nodules, is comparable to the one described for Fig. 7A.

nucleus varies widely. Examples include the following: (i) nodules originating from mottles present in the mottled clay horizon of the investigated profile (Gonzalez, 1991) (Fig. 10, case 1); (ii) ferruginised fragments of a weathered bedrock, e.g., in ferricretes of southeastern Deccan with nuclei of weathered charnockite that occurs in outcrops at a distance of  $20\mathrm{km}$  (Achuythan & Fedoroff, 2008); (iii) fragments of soil horizons; and (iv)

charcoal fragments. Charcoal as pisoliths nucleus is quite common (Fig. 11). Gonzalez (1991) mentions them as occurring in considerable abundance in Youth Island, Cuba, and they have also been observed in West Africa (Eschenbrenner, 1987; Delvigne, 1998) and southeastern Deccan (Achuythan & Fedoroff, 2008). These charcoal fragments indicate wildfires, which can affect periodically wet zones (Goldammer & Seibert, 1989) and which could correspond to abrupt events (Kennett et al., 2008). The cortex of pisoliths has no relation with the nucleus. It is generally laminated or microlaminated (Fig. 10, case 3 and 4). Clay particles are commonly accreted together with the iron oxides. The cortex frequently consists of two or more types of laminae of different colours, e.g., red and dark brown, which may be concordant or discordant (Fig. 10, case 4 and 5). Cortification probably occurs in a porous surface horizon during a high groundwater stand, whereby ferruginous nodules act as nuclei for bacterial precipitation of iron oxides from water rich in chelates (Emerson & Revsbech, 1994) and clay particles are trapped in the oxides (see also Stoops & Marcelino, 2010). Alternation of red (hematite) and dark brown (goethite) laminae probably results from fluctuations from warm humid to cooler humid periods (Berner, 1969; Bondeulle & Muller, 1988). Cross-bedding indicates erosive episodes during which the soft materials were eroded while the pisoliths were reworked or transported (Fig. 10, case 5). A final phase of ferruginous bridging can cement the pisoliths. Very few radiometric dates have been obtained for the cortex of ferruginous pisoliths, but accretion is probably a slow process (e.g.,  $0.01 - 0.02\mu \mathrm{m}$ /year; Bernal et al., 2006).

# 3.3 Calcitic Facies

Buried or relict calcic horizons and petrocalcic horizons (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006) occur in geological series from the Precambrian (Melezhik et al., 2004; Lewis et al., 2008) to the Holocene. Petrocalcic horizons or calcretes are described in numerous publications (e.g., Milnes, 1992; Nash & Smith, 2003; McLaren, 2004) (see also Durand et al., 2010). Micromorphological investigations have shown the common complexity of most of these horizons (e.g., Candy et al., 2003). Here we propose a classification of calcitic features and facies based on the concept of hierarchy.

Three main primary types of calcitic features occurring in soils can be distinguished (Fedoroff & Courty, 1994): (i) discrete calcitic features of biogenic origin; (ii) sparitic to micritic crystallisations in the form of nodules of various sizes, merging eventually in continuous horizons in the vadose zone, as a result of evaporation of water saturated with respect to calcite; and (iii) lamellar surface crusts. Like other soil-forming processes, accretion of calcite was discontinuous at geological timescales. Discontinuities result from variations in water table depth, intensity of evaporation, soil water composition and intensity of calcitic dust aggradation. The most common types of hierarchy of calcitic features and facies in palaeosols and relict soils are as follows (Fig. 12):

- Absence of hierarchy, with the calcitic facies consisting of simple features which can be of biogenic origin and/or consist of sparitic or micritic crystallisations

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/2df26985-d3ca-463e-b444-451a3aeba6b2/6f14cf3b5a386c454d4d8342a5e88e73c2dbbc56fe462074265fedd1d2648270.jpg)  
FIGURE 12 Schematised sequence of evolution of calcitic facies.

(Fig. 12, case 1). Such facies must be considered as monophase. The common secondary micritisation of primary biogenic forms should be considered as belonging to the same phase as the initial calcitic aggradation (Fedoroff et al., 1994). Such primary facies are common in palaeosols of the Loess Plateau of China, where discrete biogenic features or nodules of various sizes are monophase (Guo, 1990). The nodules locally merge into continuous monophase calccrete.

- A two-phase hierarchy, consisting of calcitic aggradation followed by partial or total dissolution (Fig. 12, case 2). Calcite dissolution produces various features. The most common are (i) partial diffuse dissolution of a sparitic groundmass expressed by floating detrital grains (e.g., Robinson et al., 2002), (ii) dissolution of a calcitic groundmass along fissures, which can be filled by illuvial clay, (iii) scoriaceous hard nodules (Guo, 1990), characterised by dissolution along the edges of the nodule, (iv) partial dissolution of soft nodules, resulting in a less pronounced crystallitic b-fabric, and (v) complete dissolution of nodules, whereby the external form is preserved (mouldic pores) (Fig. 13). Examples of two-phase features can be found in palaeosols of the Loess Plateau of China (Guo, 1990).  
- A three-phase hierarchy, consisting of a two-phase hierarchy as described above, followed by a new phase of calcitic aggradation, most frequently as micritic calcite (Fig. 12, case 3). This new phase can be biogenic (e.g., calcified root mats) or non-biogenic (e.g., sparitic cement).

Polygenetic calcitic assemblages are different from assemblages in ferricretes because after a few phases of calcite aggradation and dissolution the calcitic groundmass

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/2df26985-d3ca-463e-b444-451a3aeba6b2/5a331e765d830cb53239f27723866ddcb65aba35de149ed86e17e3079fad452d.jpg)

becomes petrified and sealed for water penetration (e.g., Wright et al., 1993; Durand et al., 2006). Further phases of calcification can occur along the top of the horizon and on walls of vertical fissures in the form of lamellar crusts. Each lamella of a surface crust is characterised by a dense, micritic groundmass in which one can recognise residues of cyanobacteria, green algae and fungi (Wright et al., 1996), as well as detrital silt-sized quartz, frequently in the form of splinters (Smalley & Vita-Finzi, 1968). Between the massive calccrete and the lamellar crust, rounded calcitic aggregates are frequently observed. Development of these lamellar crusts can be interpreted to begin with erosion of the friable upper horizon of the calcitic soil down to the petrified horizon, during a rhexistasic episode. Rounded calcitic aggregates are probably remnants of this erosion, which was mainly aeolian. A biogenic surface crust subsequently colonised the eroded soil, protecting it from further erosion. Biogenic filaments trapped aeolian dust from which carbonates were derived and reprecipitated, cementing the crust (Verrecchia et al., 1995). When a lamella was hardened, a new one developed on top. Lamellar crusts are assumed to have developed during periods that were arid and probably windy (Stahr et al., 2000).

Internal lamellar crusts can be related to climate fluctuations. During a wetter period, the petrified horizon was dissolved along fissures, whereas during the following arid period, calcium carbonate, probably supplied by aeolian dusts, was in excess and precipitated in various forms. The alternation of the wet and arid sequence may be responsible for the lamellar structure (Alonso-Zarza, 1999).

# 4. Reworked Materials

Soil reworking, soil erosion, transportation and redeposition of soil materials, and allochthonous sediment aggradation appear to be underestimated in palaeopedology. Careful analysis of palaeosols and relict soils in thin sections shows that soil covers of the past were frequently, to some extent, affected by these processes (e.g., Kemp et al., 2004). Exceptions include palaeosols buried by man (e.g., soils under burial mounds) and by tephra.

# 4.1 In Situ Soil Reworking and Mass Transportation

A continuum exists between in situ reworked soils and mass-transported soil materials (Lacerda, 2007) (Fig. 14, case 1). Both are frequently difficult to recognise and distinguish in the field. In thin sections, both are recognised by one or more of the following characteristics: (i) a massive microstructure with variable abundance of closed poly-concave vugs, frequently grading to vesicles; (ii) a granular microstructure with rounded to subrounded aggregates which are not of excremental origin; (iii) a more or less homogenised groundmass in which the color of the parent soil is preserved; (iv) the presence of fragmented pedofeatures; and (v) the presence of clayey to silty clay intercalations or of thin unlaminated clay coatings in vesicles. Ferruginous and calcitic pedofeatures tend to be rounded with sharp boundaries. Fragments of clay textural features are angular to subangular, with little or no deformation, the latter resulting in the preservation of their original aspect in XPL (see also Mücher et al., 2010).

Thin section analyses contribute to the identification of the cause of disruption of the parent soil. Soil can be disrupted by water saturation, inducing soil material dispersion and leading to the collapse of the soil structure. Completely dispersed soil material having reached thixotropy is characterised by a homogenised groundmass and by an apedal microstructure, with occluded polyconcave vugs or vesicles. In partially dispersed soil material, rounded aggregates inherited from the parent soil are embedded in dispersed material. The thixotropic state may occur in moving groundwater, in which case textural intercalations would indicate groundwater movement along selected pathways through the groundmass. A thixotropic state also occurs above a permafrost and even above a zone of seasonal deep frost (Fig. 15). Cryoturbation results in structure collapse and local displacements (e.g., Sanborn et al., 2006). Earthquakes can induce structure collapse when the soil or the subsoil is water-saturated (e.g., Wolf et al., 2006). Disruption of palaeosols can also result from a violent airburst due to the impact of a cosmic bolide (Courty et al., 2008). In thin sections, such disruption can be expressed as loose packing of angular to subangular aggregates of various sizes, initially described as frost-shattered soil (Guo, 1990).

FIGURE 15 Disturbed Chromic Luvisol, showing three types of reddish illuvial features: (i) small rounded fragments, randomly distributed in the reddish groundmass; (ii) weakly disturbed large infillings; and (iii) undisturbed clay and fine silt infillings (Po valley, northern Italy) (PPL). The fragmented facies is considered to be the result of deep frost action; illuviation has gone through different phases (i) development of a Chromic Luvisol, of which the small rounded red fragments are remnants; (ii) churning of the Luvisol; (iii) a new illuvial phase, recorded by the weakly disturbed large infillings; and (iv) another illuvial phase, during which silt grains were also translocated.

Mass-transported water-saturated soil material can be distinguished from an in situ reworked soil by (i) rounded aggregates belonging either to deep soil horizons or to the parent material (clay balls); (ii) a greater homogenisation of the groundmass in which randomly distributed, sorted fragments of pedofeatures can be present; and (iii) the presence of dusty, poorly oriented clay coatings in vesicles. The latter result from deposition of water-suspended clays in residual voids after the mass-transported material has been stabilised. They indicate mass transportation in a rather liquid form, as in present-day desert mudflows. Clay balls (Fig. 16) are torn from the dry floor on which the mass-transported material has slid down. If transportation results from collapse, the soil material consists of angular to subangular aggregates derived from various horizons of the eroded soil and in some cases from the underlying material (Rust & Nanson, 1989).

Soil micromorphology has revealed that lower horizons of deep polyphase soils are often characterised by clay fragments (see Fig. 5, case 5), whose abundance varies from scattered occurrences ( $\sim 1\%$ ) to high concentrations in materials composed of an almost pure accumulation of fragments. They exist from midlatitudes to the tropics. In the Rambouillet forest of the Paris Basin, such horizons are C horizons of Gleyic Luvisols developed over a thin loess cover that was deposited during various episodes of the last and penultimate glacial cycles. These loess layers, which are strongly affected by several phases of pedogenesis dominated by clay illuviation (Fedoroff, 1968), were either

reworked or mass-transported, as a result of deep soil freezing or permafrost conditions during the glacial maximal. Such horizons have also been reported for Red Mediterranean soils (Chromic Luvisols), especially those overlying calcretes (Mücher et al., 1972), and for some tropical soils (e.g., Boulet et al., 1986) (Fig. 17). This suggests that soil covers were periodically destabilised by drastic climatic events, such as a drought followed by heavy rains. Clay-with-flints (argiles à silex), which occurs in patches over a large area in southern England and the Paris basin, consists, to a some extent, of chalk dissolution residues and mainly of Cenozoic sediments deeply affected by soil-forming processes (Pepper, 1973; Laignel et al., 1998). Pedological aspects of these formations have only rarely been investigated (Stoops & Mathieu, 1970; Thorez et al., 1971).

# 4.2 Transport in Suspension

Soil materials transported in suspension and deposited as pedosediments are easily distinguished in thin sections from mass-transported materials by a massive microstructure, a groundmass whose colour is close to that of the parent soil, and horizontal sedimentary layering with layers of variable thickness and texture (Figs. 14, case 2 and 18). Inherited pedofeatures can be present, but in lesser abundance than in mass-transported soil materials. Ferruginous nodules, because of their resistance to both

physical disaggregation and chemical weathering, can help in identifying the source of the pedosediment. Flood-suspended particles can penetrate inside coarse deposits within river beds, where they are deposited in packing voids.

# 4.3 Aeolian Processes

The widespread occurrence of features resulting from aeolian processes shows that wind action on the soil cover is quite common at present and was episodically very strong in the past. These features occur very widely, including occurrences in the humid tropics (e.g., Iriondo & Krehling, 1997, 2007) (see Fig. 17B). Quartz exoscopy (e.g., Le Ribault, 1977), using scanning electron microscopy, is one of the methods that contribute to identifying aeolian episodes in palaeosols and relict soils.

Well-sorted coarse silt in which quartz splinters are common is a good indicator for aeolian dust aggradation (Smalley & Vita-Finzi, 1968). Thin section observations have shown that many soil covers in the past were affected by minor dust aggradation that was not sufficiently predominant to create typical loess. Such minor aggradations have been observed for interglacial palaeosols (e.g., Guo, 1990) and in areas adjacent to loess deposits, but they also exist in areas where loess is absent, such as the humid tropics (e.g., Berger et al., 1994).

Some clay coatings and infillings present in non-Luvisol-related soils have been attributed to aeolian dust (Brimhall & Lewis, 1992), for example, abundant thick clay infillings in ferricretes of the Ilgorn Plateau, southwestern Australia. The question of fine dust penetration into soils is not resolved. For instance, it is still unclear how the fine dust from the Sahara that is deposited along the northern side of the Mediterranean Sea is incorporated into soils.

Various forms of calcite, gypsum and more soluble minerals are common in palaeosols and relict soils of arid to subhumid areas. When occurring as isolated grains, their external morphology can result from aeolian processes, e.g., rounded grains produced by wind winnowing. After their deposition on the soil surface, most of these mineral occurrences are dissolved, followed by transport of ions in solution and by precipitation at depth.

The aeolian origin of lunette dunes is well known (Cooke et al., 1993). They are characterised by packing of rounded aggregates or crystals (e.g., gypsum crystals) that originate from the adjacent wind-deflated sabkha (playa) and morphology of which can be more or less altered by postdepositional soil-forming processes (Hachicha et al., 1987). Lunette-like aeolian features can also exist without being associated with a sabkha. Along the coast of southern Israel, there is a south-to-north sequence from typical loess, over loess containing rounded soil aggregates, to Vertisols (Rognon et al., 1987). In many tropical soils, thin sections reveal characteristics of aeolian origin, for instance, the presence of silt-sized quartz grains, some of them in the form of splinters, in Ferralsols developed on large basaltic plateaus in northern Argentina (Iriondo & Kröhling, 1997) (see Fig. 17B). The parent material of the entire soil profile can be aeolian in origin, as in the Sahel of western Africa (Coude-Gaussen, 1987; McTainsh et al., 1997) and in southern India (Achyuthan & Fedoroff, 2008). The aeolian origin of these relict tropical soils ('sols ferrugineux tropicaux' in western Africa; Bertrand, 1998) is indicated in thin sections by one or more of the following characteristics: (i) homogeneity of the groundmass throughout the profile; (ii) rounded aggregates, more or less altered by postdepositional soil-forming processes; (iii) association of predominantly oxic characteristics with calcitic features; and (iv) inherited rounded ferruginous features that are randomly distributed (Achyuthan & Fedoroff, 2008).

# 5. Palaeoenvironmental Significance

Many papers have demonstrated a close relationship between climate and soil type, but opinions diverge about climate impact on the evolution of past soil covers. Soil micromorphology has contributed considerably to this debate for Quaternary palaeosols (e.g., Fedoroff et al., 1990; Kemp, 2001; Kemp et al., 2001; Felix-Henningsen & Mauz, 2004) as well as for older formations (e.g., Driese & Ober, 2005).

Deciphering the environmental significance of palaeosols and relict soils is usually based on comparison with modern analogues. Some palaeosols can be interpreted adequately by applying this concept. For instance, Holocene Luvisols can be used as

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/2df26985-d3ca-463e-b444-451a3aeba6b2/45803bdaa17725cfea0228cbc1cac6c4fd50789409619e6c1a1d690d00d5e8f6.jpg)

modern analogues for interglacial palaeo-Luvisols, both being characterised by microlaminated clay coatings and infillings. Palaeosols developed during late Pleistocene interglacials (e.g., MIS 5) in the Chinese Loess Plateau region are typic Luvisols (Guo, 1990).

Palaeosols and related formations frequently present pedofeature assemblages and facies for which no modern analogues are known. For instance, large channels (a few centimetres in diameter) in soils on loess that developed during glacial cycles in northern Italy are filled, from bottom to top, by (i) cross-bedded microlaminated clay and fine silt (Fig. 19, case 4.1); (ii) massive coarse clay (Fig. 19, case 4.2); (iii) massive coarse silt with embedded silt-sized fragments of clay-illuvial features, discordantly covering dusty clay (Fig. 19, case 4.3); and (iv) a fine layer of clay and fine silt (Fig. 19, case 4.4). Similar channels were observed in Périgord, southwestern France (Sellami, 1999). The coarse silt with embedded clayey fragments could result from an abrupt event such as a Heinrich event or the Younger Dryas. Fully satisfactory interpretations for such features are still lacking. Cross-bedded microlaminated clay and fine silt coatings occur presently in soils covered by a thick snow cover melting rapidly in spring (Fedoroff et al., 1981).

Collisions with extraterrestrial bolides have been suggested to have had a regional or global impact on soil covers (Bunopas et al., 2001). Ufnar et al. (2001) described features related to the K/T impact in Cretaceous palaeosols. Courty et al. (2008), using soil

FIGURE 19 Example of facies, unknown in presently forming soils, in altered loess deposits of the last glacial cycle (Po valley, Italy).

micromorphology, have proposed a method for deciphering the effects of cosmic impacts on soils. Such impacts in soils are identified by one or more of the following characteristics: (i) groundmass disruption; (ii) heated fragments; (iii) charcoal fragments; and (iv) allochtonuous materials such as microtektites, glass shards and bituminous

components. Four tektite-strewn areas resulting from such collisions are known in for the Cenozoic and Quaternary (McCall, 2001), but pedological aspects have not been investigated.

Heated fragments of palaeosols and in situ heated palaeosols have been recognised, for instance, as subangular fragments and ellipsoidal aggregates in Java, where they are related to an occurrence of tektites (Courty et al., 2007) (see Fig. 16). In this study, heating, up to a few hundred degrees Celsius, is recognised in thin sections by (i) a complete loss of birefringence of the originally smectitic groundmass; (ii) an opaque aspect of the groundmass (Courty et al., 1989); and (iii) compaction of ellipsoidal aggregates probably by heating. In this case, heating is thought to result in a blast of hot air resulting from a meteorite impact. Heat-transformed palaeosols have also been described for volcanic regions (Usai, 1996).

Charcoal fragments that cannot be the result of human activity are common in palaeosols (Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1976) and relict soils. Their abundance is underestimated, or their presence is not even recognised, when micromorphological investigations are not carried out. They can be in the form of (i) randomly distributed or aligned fragments in reworked soil material; (ii) nodules consisting of ferruginised charcoal fragments (see Fig. 11); or (iii) silty textural features containing abundant small charcoal fragments. Charcoal fragments are at least partly related to wildfires associated with discontinuities in soil development (rhexistasic episodes). Some extensive wildfires, such as those of the Younger Dryas, may have been caused by cosmic impacts (Kennett et al., 2008).

Layers of tephra are common in palaeosols and related sediments, but they have only been used as a stratigraphic tool. The impact of major volcanic eruptions such as the 74,000 ka Toba eruption (Rampino & Self, 1993) on soils is unknown.

# 6. Transitions in Palaeosoil Sequences and Their Significance

Various types of transitions exist in palaeosoil sequences, which have to be distinguished from pedogenic horizon transitions. They can be in the form of planar abrupt truncations, or the discontinuity can be irregular, wavy or in the form of tongues. The transition can also be very progressive, even undetectable in thin sections, although radiometric dates indicate a gap of thousands to hundred thousand of years between levels separated by only a few centimetres. Transitions are frequently emphasised by stone lines, especially in the tropics. To interpret the transition in palaeosoil sequences, the underlying and overlying layers have to be compared (see Fig. 17). Earthquakes can also be responsible for the presence of discontinuities (e.g., Wolf et al., 2006).

The best documented example of transition is the passage from the last interglacial pedocomplex to the pleniglacial loess (MIS 5 to MIS 4) as it occurs in the Loess Plateau of China (Guo, 1990; Porter & An Zhisheng, 1995). This transition is characterised in thin sections by a layer with a coarse disrupted assemblage (Fig. 20A), consisting of abundant small rounded aggregates derived from the underlying Kastanozem (see Fig. 4A), randomly embedded in a coarse loessic material rich in detrital calcite grains

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/2df26985-d3ca-463e-b444-451a3aeba6b2/db0985148105b29939fd7f6b956fd719582d46a90c7fe54d7bc9663597d217d0.jpg)

(B) Blackish brown coating probably corresponding to an episode of wildfires followed by heavy rains (PPL).

(Guo, 1990). Below this layer and apparently related to it, infillings composed of blackish brown massive fine silt rich in small charcoal fragments are recognised (Fig. 20B), as well as mouldic voids after barite or gypsum crystal intergrowths (see Fig. 13). Calcitic features in the form of micritic infillings, micritic hypocoatings and sparitic infillings composed of rounded crystals in channels are present throughout the loess cover, the transition layer and underlying Kastanozem. A grain size increase occurs within the transition layer and just above in the pleniglacial loess (Porter & An Zhisheng, 1995), together with an increase in mica and heavy mineral content. A tentative reconstruction of the sequence of events, based on the hierarchy of attributes, could be the following: (i) aeolian erosion of the top of the Kastanozem, indicated by small rounded aggregates, associated with coarse loess deposition resulting from exceptional dust storms, more severe than those responsible for the formation of the main loess deposit; (ii) disruption of the top of upper Kastanozem, possibly resulting from an air blast, which shattered the soil to some centimetres depth; (iii) an episode of wildfires followed by heavy rains, which is registered by the blackish brown infillings; (iv) accumulation of gypsum or barite together with coarse loess, followed by dissolution during a wetter episode and by precipitation as crystal intergrowths in the Kastanozem, which were later dissolved during a wetter period of unknown age; and (v) development of calcitic features, apparently related to deposition of the main loess deposit, independent from the air blast. A similar type of transition from MIS 5 to MIS 4 in loess and palaeosil sequences has been observed in the Rhine valley (Rousseau et al., 2002) and in Pampean loess sections (Fig. 21) (Rosario, Argentina). In the latter study, rounded fragments of a Luvisol, probably belonging to the MIS 5 pedocomplex, are embedded in a coarse loess (Kemp et al., 2004).

# 7. Reconstruction of the History of Relict Soils

Reconstructing the history of relict soils requires first the identification of present-day pedogenic attributes, then detection of all relict attributes from the soil surface down to the unaltered parent material and finally the establishment of hierarchies between functioning and inherited attributes starting from the bottom of the profile. The palaeoenvironmental significance of each of these events should be considered at the end.

This is illustrated by the example of a Haplic Luvisol developed in loess deposited during MIS 2 in the Paris Basin, which, like many soils of soil covers of midlatitudes, contains in situ relict features (Fig. 22). In this soil, undisturbed relict characteristics are recognised in the B3t and C horizons, whereas fragments of clay coatings occur in the B2t horizon (Fedoroff, 1968). In thin sections (Fig. 22, case 1), the groundmass of the B3t horizon is a non-calcareous loess with local zones of ice lensing, crossed by abundant channels. The most common channels (V1) are coated by a dark brown, rather dusty, moderately well-oriented, massive clay coatings, juxtaposed concordantly by yellowish brown, well-oriented, translucent, microlaminated clay coatings. A few channels (V2) are lined only by massive coatings, and others (V3) only by microlaminated coatings. Some channels (V4) are uncoated, and others (V5) are filled with excrements which can also be present in V2 and V3 channels. The hierarchy of features is from the groundmass to the middle of channels: (i) zones of ice lensing; (ii) dark brown massive fine silt and clay coatings; and (iii) yellowish brown microlaminated clay coatings. Observations for channels V2, V3 and V4 are apparently not in agreement with this hierarchy. The explanation could be that channels V2 became occluded when sedimentation of yellowish brown translucent clay started, whereas channels V3 developed after the

FIGURE 22 Reconstruction of the history of a Haplic Luvisol on loess, based on the micromorphology of its B3t horizon.

formation of the massive coatings. The history of this horizon could be described as the following sequence of events: (i) development of ice lenses during or immediately after loess aggradation; (ii) a first pedogenic phase characterised by dark brown massive fine silt and clay coatings; and (iii) a second pedogenic phase characterised by yellowish brown microlaminated clay coatings. Ice lenses indicate deep frost affecting a soil

saturated with water. The dark brown coatings (cC) indicate a fundamental change in environmental conditions, which switched from an environment with very strong winds and a dusty atmosphere during loess sedimentation to biostasic conditions. The dark brown colour is due to organic matter, which was translocated together with the clay and fine silt. For this period, we can assume that the vegetation was dominated by conifers, a hypothesis based on palynological data for the MIS 2 to 1 transition in northwestern Europe. The weak sorting of fine silt and clay in these coatings and the absence of layering indicate rapid percolation in spring during snow melt. The microlaminated clay coatings are typical of Luvisols formed during the Holocene. The excrements cannot be included in this hierarchy, being formed during both illuvial phases. Figure 22 (case 2) is an attempt to reconstruct the soil profile at its main stages of development, by extrapolation of results obtained for the B3t horizon.

# 8. Dating Palaeosoil Development

Soil micromorphology contributes only indirectly to dating of palaeosoil development. Soil micromorphology cannot replace radiometric dates and stratigraphic correlations, but the lifetime of a polyphase palaeosoil can be estimated from the number and nature of pedogenic phases detected. For instance, in loess-palaeosoil sequences, the illuvial facies developed during the last interglacial (MIS 5e) formed over  $\sim 10,000$  years (e.g., Hearty et al., 2007). The duration of the exposure of palaeosols interstratified in continental deltaic formations has been estimated from the extent of development of pedofeatures (Srivastava & Parkash, 2002). In this study, passage features and weak iron oxide staining are considered to indicate a few years of exposure, whereas a moderately well-developed illuvial facies is assumed to require a few thousands of years to develop, by comparison with Early Holocene and MIS 5e illuvial facies. Estimation of the lifetime of relict soils is less certain as they are not included in a stratigraphic sequence and their different facies usually have different ages.

Soil micromorphology can also contribute to dating palaeosols development by supplying radiometric dating laboratories with samples of specific microscopic features instead of bulk samples. Only a few papers combining microscopic analysis and radiometric datings have been published. Courty et al. (1994) integrated geochemical microanalysis and micromorphology to decipher the genesis of calcitic pendants in Spitsbergen, whereas Bernal et al. (2006) proposed a radiometric method for measuring the rate of accretion of ferruginous pisolith cortexes. OSL (optically stimulated luminescence) dating was also utilised in combination with microscopic investigations on an Argentinean loess-palaeosol sequence by Kemp et al. (2003), while Kuhn & Hilgers (2005) used the same approach in southern Taunus (Germany). AMS (accelerator mass spectrometry) radiocarbon dating requires only a very small amount of carbon and could be applied to small charcoal fragments that are frequently present in palaeosols (Carcaillet, 2001).

# 9. Diagenesis

Diagenesis of recent palaeosols (Middle Pleistocene to Holocene) usually only concerns biological activity and organic matter (Chichagova, 1995). As soon as a soil is buried, the soil fauna feeding on plant residues disappears. For instance, earthworm populations may disappear, followed by the consumption of earthworm excrements by mites, replacing them with mite excrements. Fresh organic fragments in a buried soil are progressively humified and tend to disappear, whereas charcoal fragments are preserved, especially if they are ferruginised. In much older palaeosols, buried by less than a few hundred metres and not affected by tectonic movements or thermal activity, microscopic characteristics are weakly altered or unaltered by diagenesis (Retallack, 1991). In lithified palaeosols, changes are more important, but pedogenic characteristics can still be recognised in thin sections (Retallack & Wright, 1990).

Groundwater can act as a major pedogenic factor when it occurs near the soil surface, but it can also induce diagenetic processes in buried soils, similar to near-surface processes (Gibling & Rust, 1992). Development of diagenetic attributes depends on the rate of groundwater circulation, redox conditions and ionic concentration. Textural intercalations can occur at great depth where groundwater moves along faults. Soluble salts may be either dissolved or precipitated. Some iron and manganese oxide impregnations in palaeosols, unrelated to other pedofeatures, are undoubtedly of diagenetic origin.

Pressure resulting from deep burial combined with circulating groundwater leads to collapse of voids and ultimately to the development of a massive microstructure (Sheldon & Retallack, 2001).

# 10. Conclusions

Soil micromorphology has largely contributed to deciphering of palaeosols and relict soils, but its potential is far from exhausted. In the future, systematic coupling of thin section analysis by polarised light microscopy with submicroscopic and microanalytical techniques will boost soil micromorphology in this field (Courty et al., 2008). An integration of soil micromorphology with magnetic measurements (e.g., Tsatskin et al., 2001, 2006; Maher et al., 2003), radiometric dating (e.g., Bernal et al., 2006) and stable isotope analysis (Courty et al., 1994) is also important.

# 1. Introduction

The efficacy of micropedology in palaeopedological studies is widely accepted (Stoops, 2009, 2014), but no clear consensus exists for the definition of palaeosols (Catt, 1986). Suggested definitions have variably emphasised soil development in a past environment (e.g., Yaalon, 1971; Ferrari & Magaldi, 1976) and pedogenesis that began in the past (e.g.,

Bos & Sevink, 1975; Duchaufour, 1983; Fedoroff et al., 2010, 2018). Palaeosoil definitions are also complicated by the common incompleteness of palaeosoil profiles and by poor applicability of classification systems developed for modern soils (Zerboni et al., 2011). Moreover, new advances in palaeopedological research, for instance, the concepts of pedosedimentary sequences and pedostratigraphic levels (Costantini & Priori, 2007) or three-dimensional studies of past landscapes (Costantini et al., 2009), have to be taken into account. In view of these difficulties in proposing definitions and subdivision of palaeosols, this chapter is limited to presenting an overview of various types of formations recording pedogenic processes that occurred or started in the past. In the following paragraphs, various palaeosoil categories are discussed, starting with buried soils (i.e., palaeosols separated from the present-day surface), followed by palaeosols that are not separated from the surface (i.e., relict soils, polygenetic soils), and by some specific examples (i.e., reworked palaeosols fragments, rock coatings).

# 2. Buried Soils

Buried soils (Morozova, 1963; Catt, 1986) are palaeosols covered by a sediment interval that is sufficiently thick to isolate them from present-day pedogenic processes. When the buried soil is not completely isolated from surface processes, features that developed before and after burial need to be distinguished. A further challenge can be the study of intervals comprising a series of closely spaced buried soils (pedocomplexes) (Catt, 1988; Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1990; Bronger & Sedov, 2003).

Most micromorphological studies of buried soils concern Quaternary formations, including the pioneering work of Smolikova (1967, 1978) and Bronger (1972, 1978) in Central Europe, as well as many studies that were conducted as part of archaeological investigations (see Courty et al., 1989). However, many studies dealing with older occurrences, from Precambrian to Cainozoic, are also available (see Section 2.6).

# 2.1 Buried Soils in Loess

The better-known examples of Late Tertiary and Quaternary buried soils are the loess/ palaeosols sequences of Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Argentina, the US Great Plains region, North Africa and Israel, and especially, the Loess Plateau of Central China, on which numerous studies have focused.

Thin section studies have been applied to the thick and generally weakly weathered loess-bearing pedostratigraphic sequences of Central and Eastern Europe, allowing to distinguish palaeopedons and to characterise pedogenic overprints on aeolian sediments (Konecka-Betley, 1994). Diagnostic horizons of fossil soils of different ages were studied for several sections of Upper Pleistocene loess distributed throughout Poland. The occurrence at the microscale of abundant clay translocation, the mobilisation of organic matter, the growth of large calcite crystals and the neoformation of Mn/Fe oxide nodules in the micromass permitted to document the occurrence of five interstadial soils with

argillic, cambic and mollic diagnostic horizons (Konecka-Betley, 1994). Calcitic pedogenic features were studied for a loess-palaeosol pedocomplex near Kursk (Western Russia), coupling micropedology and SEM (Kovda et al., 2009). The authors noted a high variability of calcareous features at macro-, micro- and submicroscopic levels and attributed it to several wet-dry and cold-warm stages. They identified, for instance, the occurrence of pseudomycelium in modern chernozems, whereas in the buried pedocomplexes these features are progressively more leached as a consequence of warmer conditions, resulting in a greater abundance of calcite coatings along ped faces (as short thick rods) and intrapedal voids (as needles and rods). The same study illustrates that calcite nodules found in modern chernozems and in the oldest pedocomplex vary significantly; in the most ancient horizons, the central part of micritic nodules is strongly impregnated by Fe oxides.

Palaeosols in loess sequences of the China Loess Plateau and Central Asia have been investigated by thin section studies to reconstruct past environmental changes (e.g., Derbyshire, 1995; Guo et al., 1996; Kemp & Derbyshire, 1998). Kemp et al. (1999) demonstrated the high sensitivity of micromorphology in detecting palaeoenvironmental changes within the rapidly aggrading landscape of the Chinese Loess Plateau. Derbyshire et al. (1995) concluded that micromorphology is a more powerful technique if combined with magnetic susceptibility, particle size and geochemical analyses, allowing identification of a palaeoclimatic gradient in palaeosoil evolution along the Loess Plateau. In the Jiuzhoutai sequence, they identified some key features correlated to specific environmental settings, such as lenticular gypsum crystals recording restricted leaching in semiarid conditions, successive layers with relative depletion and enrichment in fine particles pointing to cryogenic processes, and both loose to welded excrements and zones of associated calcite depletion-accumulation indicating wetter environmental conditions.

Guo et al. (2008) studied a series of early Miocene and Quaternary buried soils on the Loess Plateau in China to infer changes in monsoon intensity. The Miocene palaeosols have a greater abundance of clay pedofeatures than the more recent ones, in the form of coatings and infillings with high interference colours. The difference in abundance records stronger soil development, suggesting significantly stronger and/or more persistent summer monsoons. These soils, moreover, show a higher degree of incorporation of illuvial clay into the groundmass through alternating shrink and swell (vertic) processes, typical for climates with contrasting seasons, thus suggesting strong seasonality in northern China in the early Miocene.

The micromorphological characteristics of complex S5 (Zhisheng et al., 1987; Zhao, 2003) are of special significance in terms of Pleistocene palaeoclimate, being formed under woodland vegetation during an interval corresponding to a climatic optimum. Moreover, micropedological studies evidenced that the pedocomplex preserves several distinct layers consisting of the upper Bts horizon, as well as some horizons showing desiccation cracks, and a basal horizon with  $\mathrm{CaCO_3}$  nodules (Zhao, 2003). Formation of pedogenic carbonate features in the lower horizons, caused by dissolution of calcite and

limited vertical leaching combined with a low biological activity (recorded by weakly developed excremental features in the topsoil), points to more arid conditions. In more humid parts of the Plateau, pedosequences are extensively bioturbated and can be almost completely decalcified in the upper horizons, combined with formation of carbonate coatings and needle-fibre calcite in the underlying parent material, or older palaeosols. The comparison of different bioclimate indicators, based on mineralogy, micromorphology and palynology, for a Holocene palaeosoil of the Ansai loess section from China, highlighted that oriented clay coatings developed by mechanical translocation of clay, whereas the argillic horizon developed by strong weathering and subsequent eluviation-illuviation of clay over a vertical distance of about  $60~\mathrm{cm}$ . This evidence emphasises that in a single palaeosoil in loess not only features of a period of humid and warm climate are present, but also the imprint of several different bioclimatic environments can be distinguished (He et al., 2008).

Loess sequences from Tadjikistan contain numerous palaeosols, whose genetic classification is difficult because almost all buried soils are truncated as well as affected by recalcification by carbonates derived from the overlying loess. For these sequences, micromorphology allowed distinguishing between inherited and pedogenic carbonates and identification of the occurrence of clay illuviation (Bronger et al., 1995), providing detailed palaeoclimatic information, especially for the Brunhes chron (Bronger et al., 1998). The profiles contain silt to sand-sized grains that are irregularly distributed in the groundmass, contrasting with pedogenic micritic and acicular calcite occurring in the lower layers, resulting from leaching of the overlying loess. The intensity and duration of pedogenesis is highlighted by the degree of clay illuviation and incorporation of clay coatings in the groundmass.

Micropedological studies of loess and related wind-blown deposits have been carried out at a variety of locations and helped to (i) identify occasional input/reworking of parent materials by non-aeolian processes (e.g., occurrence of sedimentary structures associated with water flow along ephemeral land surfaces); (ii) distinguish the presence of weakly developed soil horizons (i.e., cumulic soils); and (iii) quantify the contribution of specific pedogenic processes in shaping buried palaeosols (as discussed above), especially in those case where many processes were superimposed (Kemp, 1999). The above-described processes may be superimposed to weaker pedogenic processes such as frost action: recorded by platy microstructures or banded fabrics (Kemp, 1999). In many other cases, thin section studies have been successfully applied to pedosedimentary sequences in Argentina (Amiotti et al., 2001; Kemp et al., 2004), central Alaska (Josephs, 2010), Israel (Rognon et al., 1987) and Lanzarote (von Suchodoletz et al., 2009).

# 2.2 Buried Soils in Sandy Aeolian Sediments

Buried soils of roughly the same age as palaeosols in loess sequences occur as intercalations in coastal aeolian deposits. Aeolianites (or kurkars in the eastern Mediterranean regions) are littoral aeolian calcarenite deposits that record reworking of

vast quantities of shallow-marine biogenic carbonate sediment into coastal dunes (Brooke, 2001). Different cycles of aeolianite deposition and palaeosoil development along the coasts of the Elba Island (Tuscany, central Italy) were studied by Cremaschi and Trombino (1998a). Clay coatings (Fig. 1), iron-manganese oxide nodules and a strongly rubified micromass that characterise the truncated palaeosols are also typical of present-day Red Mediterranean Soils.

Detailed micromorphological studies of aeolianites from Israel evidenced that soil formation is not only constrained by climatic factors but also by continuous aeolian clay (dust) input with relatively low and variable time rates. This is suggested by degraded clay coatings, well-expressed striated b-fabrics in leached horizons and dissolution-affected fragments of calcareous aeolianite inherited from the bedrock, found in the Bk horizons (Tsatskin et al., 2009). Palaeosols corresponding to living floors buried by aeolian sediments are more common in pre-Holocene contexts (Tsatskin & Ronen, 1999; Cremaschi et al., 2015). For instance, a complex pedosequence of aeolianites and interlayered palaeosols from the coast of Northern Israel records several stages of development of discrete palaeosols within a Mousterian pedocomplex, marked by episodes of aggradation and accelerated dust input under different environmental conditions (Tsatskin & Ronen, 1999). In this case, common micritic coatings (disrupted by faunal churning) and iron oxide segregations suggest decalcification and rubification in the lowermost palaeosol intervals. The more complex juxtaposition of pedofeatures in the overlying interval indicates that clay illuviation predates calcite illuviation and recrystallisation. Tsatskin and Ronen (1999) also identified a palaeo-Vertisol that in thin section presents strongly developed shrink swell-related microfabric, common Mn oxide coatings and calcitic pseudomorphs after land snail shells. Finally, the occurrence of colluvial microlayers and various ferric accumulations (associated with gleying) in the uppermost soil interval suggests the occurrence of colluvial and aeolian processes associated with climatic instability.

# 2.3 Buried Soils in Glacial Sediments

Buried soils can be found in the context of Quaternary glacial and periglacial deposits (e.g., moraine fronts, fluvoglacial sediments, colluvial deposits). In the Val Sorda (Northern Italy), lodgement till of the Last Glacial Maximum advance of the Garda Glacier covers a thick and well-dated palaeosoil/loess pedosequence, including a cumulic chernozem overlying a less weathered loess body and a reddish palaeosoil developed on till (i.e., Alfisol) (Cremaschi, 1987; Ferraro et al., 2004; Ferraro, 2009). The common reddish clay coatings preserved in the red palaeosols at the bottom of the loess sequence suggest intense pedogenesis, which took place during Marine Isotopic Stage (MIS) 5 (Cremaschi & Zerboni, 2016). The upper part of the sequence shows less intense pedogenesis and continuous dust input, which is indicated by pedogenic features that developed during loess deposition: finely fragmented charcoal, calcified root cells and organic coatings intermixed with aeolian sediments. The over-consolidation of the pedosequence, the obliteration of the porosity and, in the uppermost part of the sequence, the deformation of layered calcareous sediment by glaciotectonic stress (Fig. 2) are related to overthrust by a thick ice sheet (at least  $500 - 700\mathrm{m}$ ) during the Last Glacial Maximum.

Perennially frozen loess deposits in the Klondike goldfields (Alaska) highlight the occurrence and the properties of palaeosols formed in full-glacial environments during MIS 2 and 4 (Sanborn et al., 2006). Buried A horizons present a banded to spongy microstructure, the latter with partially decomposed root residues and locally abundant organic matter accumulation associated with a weak granular microstructure. In the C horizons, laminations with particle-size sorting are common. The microstructures are similar to those in modern soils that contained ice lenses under perennially or seasonally frozen conditions (Cryosols), but the same features also resemble those of modern soils of temperate and boreal grasslands, in which organic matter accumulates as root

detritus. Sanborn et al. (2006) conclude that these characteristics of the palaeosols indicate affinities with soils of steppe and tundra environments, indicating a diversity of local environments in full-glacial landscapes.

# 2.4 Buried Soils in Alluvial Sediments

The migrating pattern of large rivers and the continuous input of sediments from overbank sedimentation due to seasonal or occasional floods can bury stable surfaces and the associated soils (e.g., Limbrey, 1993; Zárate et al., 2000; Hoffmann et al., 2009).

Holocene alluvial deposits in the overbank facies of the Po River plain at the edge of the Apennine alluvial fans in Northern Italy are systematically intercalated with weakly developed Atlantic and Subboreal buried soils (ranging from Regosols to Cambisols), characterised by carbonate leaching and slight hydromorphism (Cremaschi & Nicosia, 2012; Cremaschi et al., 2015). Presence of finely comminuted charcoal (Fig. 3A), redistributed calcitic wood ash, dusty clay coatings (Fig. 3B) and phosphatic aggregates records anthropogenic activities from the Late Neolithic through Chalcolithic to early Bronze Age.

Along an alluvial landscape of the Pampas (southern Argentina), Zárate et al. (2000) identified a pedosequence including horizons with a high concentration of bioclastic particles (diatoms, shells and humic acid-stained material), levels dominated by non-bioclastic coarse particles with a preferred alignment of clay domains (stipple-speckled or granostriated b-fabric) and levels strongly affected by carbonate precipitation (calcitic-crystallitic b-fabric), suggesting alternating phases of pedogenic and sedimentary inputs. A decrease in clastic sedimentation and then reestablishment of fluvial aggradation with a dominance of bioclastic sedimentation mark the early-Holocene shift from a dry subhumid to humid climate. This was followed by increasing aeolian inputs (loess) during the mid-Holocene as the climate reverted to dry subhumid, and temporary subaerial exposure of the sediments led to palaeosoil development (Zárate et al., 2000).

A dark organic layer buried by Oligocene estuarine sediments in the area of Leuven (Belgium) has traditionally been interpreted as the remnant of Cenozoic oil seepage. A micromorphological study by Van Herreweghe et al. (2003) shows a strong accumulation of organic matter (dark bands) occurring as coatings with a characteristic polygonal cracking pattern and as bridges between quartz grains, corresponding to features common in present-day hydromorphic podzols of temperate and tropical regions (see Van Ranst et al., 2018). The buried palaeosoil can therefore be interpreted as a giant buried spodic horizon.

# 2.5 Buried Soils in Colluvial Deposits

Cover beds (or colluvial deposits) can set apart pedological bodies that formed during phases of geomorphological stability in contexts that are overall dominated by slope dynamics. They can be considered as 'geomorphologically' buried palaeosols.

A Late Quaternary, widespread, complex sequence of colluvium and intercalated palaeosols from South Africa has been investigated by Botha and Fedoroff (1995), who identified clay coatings and iron oxide hypocoatings along channels as expression of the dominant soil-forming processes, pointing to conditions of seasonally impeded drainage and strong biological activity. Fragments of red limpid clay coatings occurring in voids, and infillings composed of red colluvium, suggest short-distance transport of material derived from eroded soil profiles upslope. In the same study, homogenous, typic impregnative nodules are interpreted as detrital petroplinthic pedorelicts derived from ferruginous mottles.

Soils located above the present-day treeline in the Northern Apennines (Italy) can be subdivided into an upper unit, composed of the superficial soil of colluvial origin, and a lower unit, constituted by the underlying more developed palaeosoil (Compostella et al., 2014). The colluvial unit is characterised by a grain-dominated microstructure, a dominance of weakly weathered claystone fragments in the coarse fraction and the presence of subrounded soil aggregates from dismantled older horizons, whereas the lower unit has a blocky microstructure, common channels, a dominance of moderately to strongly weathered sandstone fragments in the coarse fraction and three generations of clay coatings, which are, respectively, microlaminated, non-laminated and dusty. A similar profile was observed by Cremaschi et al. (1984a) at the Bagioletto site (northern Apennine), where a debris flow, activated by periglacial processes in the Little Ice Age, covers a palaeosoil consisting of a Bt horizon with Fe-rich microlaminated clay coatings in voids (Fig. 4). This palaeosoil includes Mesolithic and Chalcolithic archaeological material, situating its formation in the Boreal to the Subboreal periods.

# 2.6 Pre-Cainozoic Buried Soils

Palaeosols that are part of the geological record are often lithified and testify significant, and sometimes abrupt, climate changes. They were buried by subsequent sedimentary events and became lithified after burial. In some cases, they have been affected by

heating, metamorphism and/or deformation, which tends to mask pedogenic features, as demonstrated by an extensive study of Precambrian palaeosols in Canada (Gall, 1992). Microscopic evidence of diagenetic mechanical and geochemical overprinting includes compaction, development of veins that cross-cut pedogenic features, and widespread alkali and alkaline earth element metasomatism (Gall, 1992). Soils can also be covered by basalt flows or tephra (e.g., Benayas et al., 1987; Wieder et al., 1990; Sheldon, 2003; Marques et al., 2014), isolating them from surface processes (Sheldon, 2006). A common issue in the interpretation of palaeosols in the geological record is to make a distinction between factors responsible for pedogenesis, acting on the fresh parent material (i.e., clay illuviation, nodule formation), and those related to early to late diagenetic processes (i.e., calcite recrystallisation, dolomitisation) (Teruggi & Andreis, 1971; Retallack & Wright, 1990; Retallack, 1991, 1992; Srivastava & Sauer, 2014). Pedogenesis and diagenesis may produce analogous effects, but the spatial relationships of microscopic features, as well as analysis of features related to specific processes, usually allow attributing each feature either to pedogenesis or to postburial processes. Specific lithofacies corresponding to buried soils can be important stratigraphic markers, allowing long-distance correlation between outcrops (e.g., Berra et al., 2010).

Buried palaeosols that are part of the geological record are widespread in a number of specific sedimentary rock sequences, for instance, in the sandstones interlayered between limestones belonging to platform depositional systems. In coastal settings, sediments can record abrupt environmental changes, corresponding to important sea-level drops. The latter can be responsible for emersion and the onset of karstification and weathering (e.g., Berra et al., 2010; Meister et al., 2013). At several localities of the Dolomites, the Norian Dolomia Principale Formation is capped or interlayered by (polycyclic) discontinuous Terra Rossa-type palaeosols, up to  $10\mathrm{m}$  thick. These Terra Rossa-type palaeosols display a reddish micromass (consisting of diagenetic dolomitic microsparite), dark clay infillings and coatings (Fig. 5A), brownish ferruginous intrapedal

nodules (Fig. 5B), and traces of bioturbation (root casts), pointing to a warm and wet tropical pedoclimate (Trombino et al., 2006; Berra et al., 2016). Well-preserved palaeosols interlayered in the Triassic Calcare Rosso limestone from the southern Italian Alps are attributed to interplay between extensive karstification and pedogenesis after emersion (Berra et al., 2011; Vola & Jadoul, 2014). These Terra Rossa palaeosols have a dark red marly calcareous matrix, with greenish mottles when micaceous minerals are prevalent, or with reddish-yellow to brownish-yellow mottles when dolomite predominates (Binda, 2011; Vola & Jadoul, 2014). In a few cases, they contain quartz grains, vaguely outlined soil aggregates and calcitic root structures; these features possibly originated after pedogenesis under warm and wet environmental conditions.

Examples of palaeosols in non-calcareous sedimentary successions include lithified palaeosols contained within overbank sediments that have been described for the Himalayan Foreland (Srivastava et al., 2013; Srivastava & Sauer, 2014). Despite diagenetic alteration, evidence of palaeopedogenic processes is preserved in the form of striated b-fabrics (because of pedogenic slickenside development), dense impure micrite nodules with diffuse boundaries, root channels and thick microlaminated iron-rich clay coatings. These horizons were interpreted as ferruginous palaeosols developed during the Oligocene under tropical weathering. In another micromorphological study of Himalayan Foreland deposits, the well-developed red colour of palaeosols was mainly attributed to burial diagenesis, rather than to weathering and soil development under tropical climatic conditions (Singh et al., 2009).

Sandy to muddy lithified fluvial sequences can preserve evidence of former pedogenesis. For instance, palaeosols in the Maghra El-Bahari Formation (Upper Cretaceous-Lower Tertiary, Eastern Desert of Egypt) display well-oriented clay coatings and infillings that are incorporated into the micromass by vertic processes, as well as palygorskite fibres, indicating pedogenesis under arid conditions, and small iron oxide nodules (pointing to

hydromorphic soil conditions) (Wanas & Abu El-Hassan, 2006). The occurrence of pedogenic spheroidal ferruginous nodules and pyrite in the groundmass of palaeosols of the Paddy Member of the Albian Peace River Formation (Western Canada) was explained by Ufnar et al. (2005) by hydromorphic conditions and the production of sulphides by sulphate-reducing bacteria in the soil water. Micromorphological studies of palaeosoil sandstone deposits have been performed at several localities. For instance, a palaeosoil from the Lower Triassic Bunter Sandstone of Germany (the Karneol-Horizont), consisting of a lower polygenetic calcrete with dolomite and massive silica replacement of carbonates and an upper interval showing vertic features was described by Martins and Pfefferkorn (1988). In England, the Old Red Sandstone Formation preserves micromorphological evidence of calcrete formation, thus suggesting pedogenesis under arid environmental conditions during the Permian (Allen, 1986).

Buried palaeosols on igneous and metamorphic rocks are well preserved in some cases. A red palaeosol on Lower Palaeozoic low-grade metamorphic rocks of the Brabant Massif (Belgium), covered by Cretaceous marine sediments, could be identified as a truncated ferralitic saprolite, based on preserved lithic fabrics and kaolinite alteromorphs (Stoops, 1992; Mees & Stoops, 1999). In intrabasaltic palaeosols at the Giant's Causeway of Ireland, small segregated areas of iron oxides surrounded by green and grey zones point to former reducing conditions (Phillips et al., 2010).

# 3. Relict Soils

Relict soils are surface soils showing pedogenic features that formed in past pedoclimatic conditions, different from present-day conditions (Ruellan, 1971). Such palaeofeatures are most easily recognised when they record a stronger degree of soil development or weathering than present-day local soils; therefore they are not significantly affected by current environmental conditions. A particular but rare type of relict soils are exhumed soils, which are formerly buried soils that have been brought to surface by erosion.

Relict features related to ice segregation processes, in the form of lenticular platy microstructures and fragmented clay coatings, have been described by Kuhn (2003) and Kuhn et al. (2006) for Bt horizons of Pleistocene and Holocene Luvisols and Albeluvisols of North Germany, allowing to attribute the initial phases of pedogenesis to Late Glacial periglacial conditions. Systematic micromorphological investigations of soil profiles with sand wedges revealed the occurrence of numerous rounded fragments of limpid clay coatings within frost-related lenticular microplates (Kuhn, 2003), whose disruption occurred during the Late Glacial. The co-occurrence of fragmented and intact clay coatings confirms the incidence of subsequent Holocene clay illuviation, allowing reconstruction of a sequence of multiple phases of clay illuviation.

Late Tertiary to the Holocene relict soils, both exhumed and not exhumed, have been described for the Central Sahara by Cremaschi and Trombino (1998b). Reddish, undifferentiated to striated micromass, clay coatings (and fragments of coatings) and

amorphous iron oxide nodules point to pedogenesis during warm and humid phases (Fig. 6A). In the same region, superimposed relict B horizons were found to record several humid phases promoting pedogenesis, as shown by the degree of mineral grain weathering (including quartz), reddening of the micromass, striated b-fabric, and the occurrence of ferruginous nodules and clay coatings (Zerboni et al., 2011). In this study, micropedological indicators suggest that throughout the Quaternary the degree of expression of pedogenic features requiring water availability progressively decreased in the region. In the groundmass, rubification and iron oxide nodule development took place during the earliest weathering phases, whereas the most recent phases are mainly characterised by pedoturbation and calcite mobilisation.

Relict soils within pockets at the top of the limestone-bearing Rohri Hills (Sind, Pakistan) contain abundant Fe/Mn oxide nodules (lateritic concretions) in a clayey micromass, revealing pedogenesis under more humid conditions than those existing at present (Biagi & Cremaschi, 1988). The same Fe/Mn oxide nodules are also scattered along the hilltop surface, suggesting dismantling of the original tropical soil.

In the Sahara, where today erosion is the main surface process (Swezey, 2001), little evidence of in situ palaeosols is preserved, although other features related to old weathering phases may have survived. On the top of the Tadrart Acacus Massif typic, Ferich nodules with thick kaolinite-goethite coatings including few quartz grains (Fig. 6B) were observed as part of the clastic fraction of the desert pavement. They were interpreted as the sole remnant of pre-Quaternary lateritic soils, from which the groundmass had been completely removed (Zerboni et al., 2015a).

In the Ligurian Alps (Northern Italy), a representative profile comprises (i) a lower interval with an angular blocky microstructure, strongly weathered coarse mineral grains including runiquartz (Eswaran et al., 1975; see also Marcelino et al., 2018; Stoops &

Marcelino, 2018), a reddish micromass (Fig. 7A), two generations of clay coatings and infillings (i.e., limpid reddish clay coatings and dense infillings, and thin yellowish clay coatings) and few alteromorphic iron oxide nodules; and (ii) the overlying soil in the loess cover, with a granular microstructure, unweathered minerals, yellow micromass (Fig. 7B), few clay coatings (i.e., microlaminated yellowish clay coatings and infillings, with sharp extinction lines in XPL), and orthic and anorthic iron oxide nodules (Rellini et al., 2009). The micromorphological characteristics of the lower interval are considered to be comparable to those of strongly weathered present-day subtropical to tropical soils, whereas those in the upper interval show features comparable to Late Glacial interstadial soils of central Europe.

On the slopes of a limestone plateau  $400\mathrm{m}$  a.s.l. in Northern Italy, Trombino and Ferraro (2002) identified a soil profile composed of two different pedological units: a Terra Rossa relict fersiallitic palaeosoil with reddish micromass and striated b-fabric (due to incorporation of clay coatings), overlain by a thin soil developed from loess, with yellowish micromass and crystallitic b-fabric. Terra Rossa palaeosols on the calcareous plateaus of Western Europe are considered to be examples of relict palaeosols (Duchaufour, 1983). They developed during the Late Tertiary and the Pleistocene, persisting today in a completely different pedoclimatic regime.

# 4. Polygenetic Soils

Polygenetic soils (Bos & Sevink, 1975) developed in the course of multiple periods of pedogenesis that were not separated by periods of significant erosion or sedimentation. This can result in superposition of features that formed in contrasting environmental settings, which can be distinguished by thin section studies (Tursina, 2009).

# 4.1 Polygenetic Soil on Late Pleistocene Loess

The sequences of Late Pleistocene palaeosols in the Paris Basin (Fedoroff & Goldberg, 1982) are a paradigmatic example of polygenetic soils on loess. Different pedogenic cycles are represented by (i) yellowish red, laminated clay coatings formed in a phase of clay illuviation in the last interglacial, (ii) hydromorphic degradation related to cooling at the beginning of the last glacial phase (not based on micromorphological features), (iii) reddish brown, dusty, laminated clay coatings formed by periglacial degradation during the Last Glacial Maximum, and (iv) various stages of weak clay illuviation (yellow laminated clay coatings) in the Holocene.

Different generations of pure clay coatings, alternating with coarse clay to fine sand coatings, were observed for the Bagaggera profile (Northern Italy) (Fig. 8), suggesting alternating periods of soil development in temperate climate and periods marked by structure degradation in cooler climatic conditions (Cremaschi et al., 1984b). The interpretation of the micropedological observations is supported by luminescence dating of the sequence and the occurrence of Mousterian and Aurignacian lithics within the profile, allowing age determination of distinct pedogenetic phases (Cremaschi et al., 1990).

In the Ghiardo profile, at the southern edge of the Po Plain, a different type of evolution is revealed by micromorphological analysis (Cremaschi et al., 2015), with occurrences of small charcoal particles, and granular and platy microstructures induced by frost (Cremaschi & Van Vliet-Lanoë, 1990), which are superimposed by features recording strong vertic behaviour in the form of clay coating fragments (Fig. 9A) and striated b-fabric (Fig. 9B). Textural pedofeatures are widespread in the E horizon; layered coatings and infillings with alternating dusty and silty clay confirm that the topsoil was exposed for some time and reworked in response to Chalcolithic deforestation.

A Mid-Upper Pleistocene pedosedimentary sequence in the central Po Plain (Monte Netto, Northern Italy), consists of several loess layers showing different degrees of weathering (Zerboni et al., 2015b). The lower part of the sequence comprises a strongly weathered (rubified) palaeosol developed on colluvial sediments (Mid-Pleistocene age), covered by three different loess intervals showing different degrees of pedogenesis, expressed by microstructure type (ranging from massive to subangular blocky), micromass colour, and, mainly, pedofeature characteristics: (i) thickness, colour and grain-size of textural pedofeatures (i.e., yellowish to orange clay coatings and fragments of coatings); (ii) type and density of amorphous pedofeatures (i.e., iron and manganese oxide nodules, with both sharp and diffuse boundaries, and Fe/Mn oxide hypocoatings); and (iii) presence of iron oxide-depleted areas in the groundmass. The polygenetic nature of the Monte Netto pedosequence is testified by the juxtaposition or superimposition of the these pedofeatures, with, for instance (from oldest to most recent), stratigraphic superimposition of fragmented red clay coatings, yellow layered clay coatings, orange and limpid clay infillings, and yellowish brown dusty clay coating, allowing recognition of several subsequent phases of illuviation, with decreasing intensity (Fig. 10).

# 4.2 Vetusols

Vetusols (Cremaschi, 1987), also called archaeosols (Hubschman, 1975), are thick polygenetic soils related to ancient surfaces, developed under a particular and specific set of climate-controlled pedogenic processes (e.g., decarbonation, mineral weathering, clay illuviation, rubification) persisting for a long time (at least since the Lower-Middle Pleistocene), whereby their formation is controlled by geomorphological surface stability. Vetusols seem to be less sensitive to the Quaternary climate changes than other types of palaeosols (Cremaschi & Busacca, 1994; Busacca & Cremaschi, 1998).

The palaeosoil's chronosequence on the terraced Trebbia River alluvial fans (Northern Italy) includes five members, dating from the Early/Middle Pleistocene to the Early Holocene. The different members of the chronosequence, from youngest to oldest, are characterised by increasing thickness of the weathering profiles, as well as increasing complexity and number of their horizons, mineralogical maturity and number of identifiable loess covers (Busacca & Cremaschi, 1998). The presence of several generations of clay coatings (Fig. 11), often juxtaposed to coarse/dusty coatings (see Kuhn et al., 2018), and of reddish sand-sized aggregates rich in kaolinite and hematite (i.e., pseudosands; Cremaschi & Sevink, 1987) allows correlation between the oldest member of the chronosequence and relict palaeosols of the region.

The Collecchio palaeosoil, a Ferretto-type palaeosoil in Northern Italy, displays a deeply weathered ferralitic soil characterised by abundant clay coatings and common large Mn-bearing and ferruginous concentric nodules as well as diffuse iron oxide impregnations of the micromass, pointing to a plinthitic horizon, developed under past

tropical environmental conditions (Ferrari & Magaldi, 1968). The so-called Ferretto palaeosol was therefore interpreted as a marker for the long Mindel-Riss interglacial, but more recent studies have identified it as a Vetusol (Billard, 1995).

# 4.3 Other Occurrences

In polygenetic soils along stable surfaces in the Gangetic Plains (India), clay illuviation was more intense during the most recent of several recognised pedogenic phases, as indicated by enrichment of the groundmass of clay intercalations and strongly birefringent microlaminated clay pedofeatures. Clay pedofeatures that formed during earlier stages are degraded, in the form of bleaching, fragmentation, loss of preferred orientation and development of a coarse speckled appearance (Srivastava & Parkash, 2002). Moreover, in the older phase, the formation of irregularly shaped carbonate nodules with inclusions of groundmass material suggests the occurrence of a more recent dry phase, followed by dissolution-reprecipitation and partial to complete removal of carbonates from the soil during wetter conditions. In the Granada Basin (SE Spain), discontinuous sedimentation and soil development episodes during the Pleistocene were governed by pulses of tectonic uplift, whereby the main pedogenic processes included leaching of carbonates, clay illuviation, and rubification, but the degree of development of the weathering horizons varied over time (Ortiz et al., 2002). Those soils, formed on Early Pleistocene surface show the strongest development, but after their formation they were partially truncated and recalcified, thus resulting in polygenetic soils. In the most recent soils, relative thickness of clay coatings, increasing progressively in more ancient soils, confirms the occurrence of a long pedogenic phase, whereas the occurrence of frost-fragmented clay coatings is related to the occurrence of cold episodes following Bt horizon formation.

In a palaeopedological study of deposits of the Quaternary intramontane basin of the Val d'Agri (Southern Italy), Zembo et al. (2012) described several different spatial

relationships between pedogenic features, corresponding to temporal relationships among pedogenetic processes identified, indicative of highly variable climatic conditions and/or water regime: (i) sharply delimited nucleic concentric ferruginous nodules with juxtaposed amorphous iron oxide hypocoatings; (ii) compound juxtaposed reddish clay coatings and overlying limpid yellowish clay coatings, and (in other samples) reddish and limpid yellowish clay coatings; (iii) different generations of sparite coatings juxtaposed to micritic nodules, or acicular calcite crystals locally juxtaposed to calcite coatings and infillings; and (iv) anorthic iron and manganese oxide nodules with silt and clay coating. These observations allowed identifying six pedogenic cycles characterised by different soil-forming processes acting under specific palaeoenvironmental conditions, from old to young: (i) warm-humid conditions in a subtropical-tropical climate (Chromic Luvisol development phase); (ii) moderately semiarid environment (Petric Calcisol development phase); (iii) warm conditions with seasonal water deficit (second Chromic Luvisol development phase); (iv) increasing seasonality and/or moderate aridity (Gleic Vertisol development phase); (v) humid-temperate climatic conditions with forest vegetation (third Chromic Luvisol development phase); and (vi) decline of vegetation cover during climate deterioration (Calcic Luvisol development phase).

Examples of palaeosols recording polycyclic pedogenesis include occurrences in Western Liguria (Northern Italy), showing compound juxtaposed clay coatings (Rellini et al., 2007) (Fig. 12). A younger generation of yellow limpid clay coatings is characterised by sharp or diffuse extinction lines, pointing to weak Holocene pedogenesis under a temperate-humid climate. It is juxtaposed to an older generation of reddish dusty clay coatings, showing a stronger degree of assimilation into the groundmass. The latter are similar to those found in deeply weathered tropical soils and are not compatible with the present climate. For the same area, Rellini et al. (2015) described another example of polycyclic pedogenesis, based on compound juxtaposed but discordant clay coatings. The younger generation is represented by yellowish-grey dusty clay coatings and/or

dense infillings, pertaining to a Holocene pedogenesis, whereas thin reddish brown limpid clay coatings and dense infillings, without lamination but with sharp extinction lines, are observed as an older generation, indicative of a strong illuvial phase that happened during the Middle Pleistocene. The discordance between both generations of clay coatings suggests an interruption of pedogenesis.

# 5. Reworked Soil Material

The presence of reworked soil material, either as soil horizon fragments or in more dispersed form, demonstrates the former occurrence of soils that formed in past environmental conditions, and it can indicate the existence of palaeosurfaces that have been dismantled by erosion.

Mroczek (2013) demonstrated the usefulness of reworked soil fragments in discriminating between undisturbed and recycled loess (Smalley, 1972; Pécsi & Richter, 1996) and thus to establish a relationship between the youngest loess cover (and related palaeosols) and older loess deposits. Deformed clay infillings and rounded fragments of clay coatings partly with undulating extinction bands, and rounded Fe and Mn/Fe oxide nodules are inherited from older, pre-altered sediments.

Rellini et al. (2015) reported the presence of lateritic soils fragments (see also Marcelino et al., 2018; Stoops & Marcelino, 2018) in a coastal pedosedimentary sequence developed in NW Italy during the Early Quaternary. The fragments are Fe oxide-impregnated nodules (Fig. 13), often containing runiquartz and strongly weathered mineral grains. They record the former existence upslope of strongly weathered palaeosols that are now completely dismantled. Moreover, these lateritic nodules are responsible for iron oxide enrichment and hardening of soil horizons, resulting in the development of a petroplinthic horizon (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015), in a context that should not have been favourable for its formation. Strongly weathered reworked soil fragments, described as Fe-rich amorphous nodules (see Fig. 6), have also been

identified in other environmental contexts, for instance, by Zerboni et al. (2011) in palaeosols from the Libyan Sahara. They suggest the presence of former ferruginous soils that developed during the Middle Pleistocene, and which were subsequently truncated, reworked and incorporated into younger soils.

Reworked soil fragments generally help in identifying phases of strong weathering that occurred in the past, but in some cases, they also help in identifying phases of less intense soil development. Compostella et al. (2014) identified subbounded to subangular soil aggregates (Fig. 14) in soil profiles located above the present-day treeline at about  $1800\mathrm{m}$  a.s.l. in the Northern Apennines (Italy), which seem to originate from dismantled palaeosols characterised by strong mineral alteration and clay illuviation, which are today inactive in the area. The abundance of these fragments of pre-altered soil material could explain the apparent (at field description level) strong development of the horizons in which they are found.

Reworked soil fragments can be found also in infillings of many kinds of sedimentary traps, including sinkholes and karst pockets. The latter include occurrences in Late Pleistocene aeolianites of the Yucatán peninsula, for which reworked fragments of clay coatings and redoximorphic features were observed, pointing to continuous pedogenesis in humid conditions, lasting several thousand years during the Early-Middle Holocene. Thick recalcified pedosediments in the same pockets indicate redeposition of soil-derived material during a late phase of landscape change that could be related to ancient Maya land-use (Cabadas-Báez et al., 2010). In the pedogenic fill of a sinkhole in Central Syria, rounded aggregates of carbonate-free soil material occur (Fig. 15), attesting the former presence of a currently dismantled fersiallitic soil (Trombino, 2007). Reworked soil fragments, including anorthic Fe/Mn oxide concretions, found in the uppermost horizon of loess sequences in northern Italy also suggest colluvial reworking of wind-blown sediments and their reorganisation promoted by human-induced deforestation (Cremaschi et al., 2015).

# 6. Weathering Surfaces and Rock Coatings

The first step of soil development on rock substrates is alteration along subaerially exposed bare rock surfaces (Blume et al., 2016). Weathered surfaces and coatings on rock outcrops (Dorn, 1996) can therefore be considered as palaeosols, recording palaeoenvironmental information. Weathering rinds represent the initial step of the decay of the rock outcrop, whereas rock coatings are surface accretions, related to weathering. Thin section studies of weathering surfaces and rinds have mainly focussed on weathering products and salt accumulation, and on microorganisms and their by-products, aimed at understanding the nature and rates of weathering processes, to interpret their geomorphological and palaeoclimatic significance (e.g., Dorn et al., 1992; Dorn, 1996; Viles & Goudie, 2007; Andre et al., 2008; Liu & Broecker, 2008; Favero-Longo et al., 2011; Dorn et al., 2013a, 2013b; Goldsmith et al., 2014; Marszalek et al., 2014). Micromorphology may help the investigation of various cavernous surface features (e.g., tafoni, honeycomb structures), analysing the loss or accumulation of mineral and organic constituents (Guglielmin et al., 2005; Mol & Viles, 2012; Dorn et al., 2013a). Because most authors have used different terminologies for their descriptions, Zerboni (2008) suggested the use of the concepts and terminology proposed by Stoops (2003) for sake of uniformity.

Rock varnish is a dark brown to black coating that in arid and semiarid lands covers stable subaerially exposed rock surfaces (Dorn & Oberlander, 1981; Dorn, 1996, 2009). It consists mainly of clay minerals and Mn/Fe oxides (Potter & Rossman, 1977), but phosphates, sulphates, carbonates and organic particles can also be present (Dorn et al., 1989; Cremaschi, 1996; Zerboni, 2008). At the microscopic scale, rock varnish is generally layered, with each layer corresponding to specific environmental settings. In Mn oxide-bearing rock varnish of the Sahara (Zerboni, 2008), the basal layer consists of laminated red clay coatings and infillings, occupying the space between quartz grains (Fig. 16),

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/2e632031-ec4d-4f62-a448-8d25f8e9c3eb/9df2e2c61c951ddf937754112ce10b252eddb9bbd09dec9bb2de4ff87b4fc8ca.jpg)

formed by clay illuviation under wet environmental conditions. The overlying layer developed during progressively more arid conditions that promoted the formation of manganese oxides, which impregnated the previously deposited clay (see also Vepraskas et al., 2018). The resulting impregnation is generally dense and diffuse, becoming less intense toward the bottom. Finally, thin dusty coatings form the outermost layer, corresponding to deposition of dust under arid climate conditions. Rock varnish has been described also for tropical regions as a product of past environmental conditions. In southern Katanga (DR Congo), residual lateritic gravel on exposed surfaces is covered by varnish, whose colour and fabric are different for different planation levels (Alexandre, 2002). Also in arid regions rock varnish is a good indicator of the relative chronology of geomorphological units (Dorn, 1988; Hooke & Dorn, 1992). In Antarctica, rock varnish developed on sandstone is more complex than on granitic rocks. It consists of alternating layers of dusty silica-rich glass, rich in Al and alkali elements (Na, Ca, K), and dark opaque jarosite-bearing layers (Zerboni & Guglielmin, 2016). The silica- and jarosite-bearing laminae can be very thin and sometimes have a stromatolithic aspect (Fig. 17). On the external part of rocks, they form continuous coatings, whereas in the inner part of the sandstone they occur as coatings and infillings along intergranular voids.

Mn/Fe-bearing crusts and coatings representing the classical Mn-rich varnish are thicker and enclose quartz grains, commonly with pellicular coatings on grains that may have a fibrous structure, resulting from biomineralisation of former fungal hyphae replaced by Mn/Fe oxides (Mergelov et al., 2012; Zerboni & Guglielmin, 2016). Voids within rock surface deposits can be filled with gypsum, formed from components that are commonly available in local aerosols and they can also contain biogenic oxideate accumulations as by-products of algal and fungal metabolism.

# 7. Palaeosoil Development Indices

Several authors have proposed micropedological indices to quantify the degree of palaeosoil development. The construction of micropedological indexes requires a good understanding of soil micromorphology and the possibility to analyse a large set of slides to reach statistically validated assumptions. One example is the Micromorphological Soil Development Index (MISODI) (Magaldi & Tallini, 2000), proposed to assess soil development and degree of weathering of palaeosols of Central Italy. This index considers microstructure types, b-fabric patterns, frequency and thickness of clay and iron oxide coatings, frequency and size of iron nodules, and degree of alteration of coarse mineral grains. Based on this index, Khormali et al. (2003) proposed the MISECA (Micromorphological Index of Soil Evolution in highly Calcareous arid to semiarid Conditions) index of soil evolution for highly calcareous materials in arid and semiarid environments. It takes into account roughly the same features as the MISODI index, with addition of the frequency of calcite depletion features. The  $S_{\mathrm{BC}}$  index (Xiaomin et al., 1994) is another micropedological indicator suggesting arid or subhumid environments. In this case, the ratio between the volume of channels (and excrements) and that of calcite grains that are part of the groundmass is considered to be sensitive to environmental conditions, with subhumid environments represented by the palaeosoil intervals, separated by interval recording more arid episodes. Finally, even if they were not conceived expressly for palaeosols, indices expressing aspects of clay illuviation (Miedema & Slager, 1972; see also Kuhn et al., 2018) can be used to compare the degree of development of palaeosols comprising Bt horizons (Bellini et al., 2015).

# 8. Conclusions

The micromorphological study of palaeosols is an important tool to investigate the processes that promoted soil formation and weathering in the past (e.g., Fedoroff, 1967, 1971; Kemp, 1998, 1999), allowing to obtain information about palaeoclimates and palaeoenvironments. One prerequisite to obtain a reliable palaeoclimatic reconstruction is that micropedological characteristics of present-day analogous soils have to be well known and understood.

Although micromorphology has been applied for several decades in palaeosoil interpretation (Kubiëna, 1963), deducing palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic information from soils remains a challenging process, requiring careful analysis of soil characteristics. Pedogenic features are the result of the concomitant action of many processes, whereby climate plays a fundamental role, but also topography, vegetation and parent material are important, and, particularly in palaeosoil studies, a careful consideration of the factor time is mandatory. Only if the effect of factors other than climate can be considered to be minimal or invariant, it will be possible to infer the true role of past climate in the formation of palaeosols.

Micropedological investigation also offers a fundamental tool to examine pedocomplexes and pedosedimentary sequences, in which palaeosols alternate with unweathered (or very weakly weathered) sediments (e.g., Fedoroff & Goldberg, 1982; Kemp et al., 1995; Kemp, 1999; Kemp & Zárate, 2000; Mroczek, 2013; Zerboni et al., 2015b).

From a theoretical point of view, no micromorphological feature can be considered by itself to be indicative of past processes: all the features that can be observed in thin section can record past pedogenic phases, if they are not in equilibrium with present-day pedoenvironmental conditions, in terms of both climate and landscape position.

# 1. Introduction

The aim of micromorphology is to contribute to the understanding of soils and regoliths and their identification, genesis and relative chronology. The first step in this process is identification of the components and analysis of the fabric, followed by its description. The next, most important step is the interpretation of the observations. This chapter intends to be a help in reaching this goal. The first part comprises general guidelines for interpretation. The second part provides a guide, in table format, to micromorphological features discussed in the various chapters of this book.

In many cases, the study of a single soil thin section is not sufficient for understanding all genetic processes. In practice, the interpretation of micromorphological features mostly requires comparative studies between different horizons of a same profile, between different profiles and between samples collected during different periods (e.g., before and after cultivation), or between natural and experimental materials.

When using the tables, the reader should realise that in some cases the absence of a feature may be more characteristic than its presence, which cannot be fully outlined in a table.

# 1.1 Criteria for In Situ Formation and Relative Chronology

For interpretation of genetic processes in soils and regoliths, it is important to determine which features were formed in situ and which were inherited from the parent material. Regarding genetic processes, it is also important to state a chronological order to understand the sequence of processes, even if the soil was interpreted as monogenetic in the field.

The following rules can help in distinguishing between in situ and inherited features:

- Impregnative features (e.g., nodules, hypocoatings) with diffuse boundaries and composition and fabric of the coarse material that are similar to those of the surrounding groundmass are formed in situ; however, one should take into account

that (i) dilution of the coarse material can occur, as a result of crystallisation pressure expulsing grains, in the case of crystalline impregnative materials, and (ii) impregnative nodules can acquire sharp boundaries in vertic and other pedoturbated materials (disorthic nodules).

- Nodules in which the nature and arrangement of the coarse material are different from those in the surrounding groundmass are (i) inherited from the parent material (e.g., colluvial material), or (ii) formed during an earlier stage of soil development, provided the difference in texture and/or mineralogical composition can be explained by a more advanced stage of weathering of the surrounding groundmass (e.g., weatherable minerals present in the nodule, but absent in the groundmass).  
- Features related to surfaces or voids (coatings, hypocoatings, quasicoatings) always postdate surface of void formation; coatings associated with the surface of voids are generally formed in situ, which is not always the case for coatings covering the surface of grains (e.g., iron oxide coatings on transported sand grains or pebbles).  
- Infillings postdate void formation and are therefore generally formed in situ; passage features are also considered as in situ.  
- Intercalations are always considered as having formed in situ, although their pedogenic nature is not always evident.  
- Euhedral crystals of minerals known to form in soil environments, especially of more soluble minerals, are supposed to be formed in situ.

Monogenetic soils are very rare, except for weakly developed profiles. Already during formation of a mature soil, considered as monogenetic, different phases occur, which may have different micromorphological imprints. If a change in climate or geomorphological position takes place, additional overprinting of features occurs. One of the important tasks of micromorphology is to clarify the relative chronology of micromorphological features, and thus of pedogenic processes. In many cases, it is the only possible method to disentangle the complex history of a soil (Cremaschi et al., 2018; Fedoroff et al., 2018). However, setting up the relative chronology of two or more features is not always easy. The following simple rules may help: (i) when two coatings, infillings or intercalations intersect, the continuous one is the youngest; (ii) in the case of juxtaposed coatings, the one immediately related to the covered surface is the oldest, and the overlying coating is the youngest; (iii) features enclosed by other ones are older than the surrounding features; and (iv) features crossing others and continuing in the surrounding groundmass postdate the crossed feature (e.g., infillings of planar voids crossing a nodule).

# 1.2 Relicts of the Parent Material

A soil obviously bears characteristics of its parent material. These are best preserved and most pronounced in the coarse fraction (see also Stoops & Mees, 2018). Some authors propose that the degree of expression of these characteristics gradually diminishes, ultimately resulting in a similar soil material for different parent materials (Chesworth, 1973). Because the coarse material is mainly, but not exclusively, inherited from the parent material, it is anyway our most important source of information about the latter.

Changes occurring during saprolite or soil development are an indication of the degree of weathering.

# 1.2.1 Nature of the Parent Material

For identification of the parent material, the shape, relative size, absolute size and mineralogical composition of the grains are important.

A rounded shape points to transported grains and indicates that the profile has developed in sedimentary deposits (e.g., alluvium, weathered sandstone). Angular grains, on the contrary, are typical for in situ weathering of igneous or metamorphic rocks, or for some glacial sedimentary parent materials.

Both the absolute size of the grains and their sorting can give information about the genesis of sedimentary materials. For example, aeolian deposits have a good sorting, whereas fan deposits are poorly sorted. Material derived from in situ weathering generally shows poor sorting.

For the interpretation of the mineralogical composition of the coarse fraction, the reader is referred to handbooks on petrography (see Stoops & Mees, 2018). Special attention should be given to specific details visible in thin sections such as the following:

- Colour: e.g., minerals such as biotite, hornblende and tourmaline can have different colours depending on their origin; differences in UV or blue light fluorescence or cathodoluminescence can also point to different origins  
- Inclusions: e.g., inclusions of volcanic glass in feldspar grains point to a volcanic origin (Stoops et al., 2018); different inclusions in quartz grains (e.g., rutile needles, mica flakes) are indicative of different origins; fissured quartz grains with hematite or gibbsite infillings point to a lateritic origin (Marcelino et al., 2018; Stoops & Marcelino, 2018)  
- Zoning: e.g., zoning in feldspar and pyroxenes generally excludes a metamorphic origin  
- Deformation features: e.g., wavy extinction, especially in quartz grains, points to a stress deformation of the source rock (e.g., metamorphic rocks)

The abrupt appearance or disappearance of a mineral species in a profile, which cannot be explained by weathering, generally points to a lithological discontinuity. In a homogeneous profile, the same minerals should occur throughout the profile in the same proportions, as far as weathering did not change relative mineral abundance.

# 1.2.2 Degree of Weathering

For determining the degree of weathering, it is important to look both to the individual grains and to the proportions of different mineral species.

Weathering of individual grains can be expressed by their shape (e.g., denticulate pyroxene or amphibole crystals) and/or by their optical properties (e.g., change of colour, relief and interference colours of biotite or chlorite). For more details the reader is referred to the excellent atlas by Delvigne (1998) (see also Stoops & Mees, 2018). Hydrothermal weathering or diagenesis of the parent rock can be misleading in studies of weathering in surface conditions. Changes in proportions of different minerals (e.g., feldspar/quartz ratio) can also give indications on the occurrence and degree of weathering.

The composition of the coarse material does not necessarily reflect only the nature of the rock from which it is derived, but also the influence of later additions, such as aeolian materials (loess, volcanic ash) and anthropogenic deposits (e.g., coal, pottery fragments, chert).

In the case of alluvial or colluvial material (Mücher et al., 2018; Cremaschi et al., 2018), part of the coarse fraction can be of pedogenic origin, for example, reworked iron oxide or carbonate nodules.

The fine material of the soil is in most cases so strongly influenced by pedogenic processes that it is generally no longer possible to deduce information on the parent material from the study of the micromass in thin sections.

# 2. Guide to Features

In the following part, an effort has been made to relate the most common micromorphological features, as reported in this book, to processes, soil horizons and types of soil and regolith materials. The indicated horizon type does not strictly correspond to a diagnostic horizon. For instance, micromorphological characteristics of an oxic horizon may be reported, even when the cation exchange capacity of the soil is too high to qualify for the oxic diagnostic horizon according to Soil Taxonomy, or morphological vertic properties may be present in materials that do not meet the climatic requirements for Vertisols.

The overviews presented in these tables are neither systematic nor exclusive, and some features therefore appear in more than one section. Not all features mentioned in the various chapters of the book could be listed in these tables.

# 2.1 Microstructure and c/f-Related Distribution Patterns

Gravelly, sandy and silty materials without clay are characterised by the presence of microscopically visible, inherent microporosity (simple packing pores), absent in both loamy and clayey materials. This large inherent porosity may give rise to special features in coarse sand and gravel, such as pendants and cappings. Even at a macroscopic scale, it is obvious that the main factor determining the expression of pedogenic processes is the texture of the parent material, e.g., sandy Vertisols or clayey Spodosols do not exist. On a microscopic scale, the influence of texture is still more evident, e.g., the micromorphological expression of an argillic horizon will be quite different in sandy soils and in loamy or clayey materials. Therefore it is useful to make a distinction between materials of different textural classes. For gravelly, sandy or silty materials, basic microstructures, named according to their c/f-related distribution pattern, are used (Stoops, 2003). Intergrades between the basic microstructures may occur, as already proposed by Stoops & Jongerius (1975), and mixtures are commonly observed.

# 2.1.1 Basic Microstructures

For pure gravelly, sandy or silty materials, coarse monic can be considered as an initial stage. Addition of fine material by weathering or by external input leads first to

enaulfic, chitonic or gefuric types, depending on composition, and finally to porphyric. When mass transfer occurs from the coarse to the fine fraction through weathering, transformation to single-spaced, double-spaced or open porphyric can take place (Chadwick & Nettleton, 1994). Iluviation of fine material, combined with thorough pedoturbation, can also gradually give rise to single-spaced to open porphyric patterns.

The evolution of coarse monic to porphyric comprises successively monic, gefuric, chitonic and porphyric when cohesive forces dominate, which is the case when the fine fraction is composed of covalently bonded silica, iron, aluminium and organic matter. The series is monic, enaulic, gefuric-chitonic and porphyric when adhesive forces prevail, which occurs when ionically bonded salts are dominant, in arid environments.

Basic related distribution patterns of silty or loamy materials are difficult to describe in thin sections in transmitted light, as overlapping of grains is quite common.

Gradual transitions between enaulic basic microstructures and granular microstructures (Stoops, 2008) can be observed in soils. Chitonic and gefuric basic microstructures are practically inexistent in surface horizons, and spongy microstructures are exceptional in all profile positions.

Because microstructure descriptions refer to the soil as a whole, including pedofeatures, the 'coarse material' and 'fine material' columns in the tables for basic microstructure types include not only coarse and fine mineral components of the groundmass but also fabric elements such as organic material, clay coatings and gypsum crystals.

In the following tables, the term 'various' as coarse material description is used to indicate a composition ranging from quartz-free to quartz-rich. 'Resistant only' refers to coarse material composed essentially of quartz, with minor amounts of highly stable minerals such as anatase, rutile, tourmaline, zircon and certain opaque minerals. The term 'mainly resistant' refers to quartz with some relatively stable but weatherable minerals such as muscovite and microcline.

# 2.1.2 Granular Microstructure

The granular microstructure is defined as being composed of small spherical aggregates, but this definition is often not strictly followed. In many cases, it is also used to describe small equant aggregates with an irregular or angular to subangular shape, as can be deduced from published photographs. In some cases, fine crumb microstructures are described as granular. A correct description of granular aggregates would help understanding the genesis of this microstructure type, which is still under discussion (see Kovda & Mermut, 2018; Marcelino et al., 2018; Stoops et al., 2018), both biological and physical processes being proposed.

Blocky microstructures are not characteristic of specific soils, but their presence excludes materials such as spodic and andic. The large dimensions of the peds often make it impossible to observe them in thin sections. Angular blocky microstructures seen in thin sections are often artefacts resulting from drying of the material before impregnation.
