# Abstract

Is there a story that floor layers tell us about human history? A set of former floors were investigated using a combination of micromorphology, ethnography and macroremain analyses at a former mill in Dolni Něměí in the eastern part of the Czech Republic. The floor layers had been accumulating since the end of the eighteenth century. A recently made earth floor, maintained for nearly 20 years, four times per year, in accordance with local knowledge passed down from mothers to daughters, formed the topmost layer. The main aim of the paper is: (1) to examine and contrast morphological characteristics of floors against known practices, which will be a useful reference for archaeological examples; (2) to compare the observations/findings to established knowledge of processes of floor formation. The structure of former floor layers preserved below the recent floor provided an indication of how floor care practices changed over the centuries, how these differed in different parts of the house and possible accumulation rate of the floor layer. This research illustrates that the micromorphological study of recent floors combined with ethnographic knowledge and macroremain analyses is a valuable methodological approach for the interpretation of archaeological case studies.

# Introduction

Earth floors may be understood as witnesses to everyday life as, in the past (before WWII), they were integral parts of houses in most villages in Central Europe (Langer 2010). There may have been many benefits from building up an earth floor in the living rooms of a house. It absorbed the heat during the day and radiated it out at night, providing a surface that was cool to walk on during the day and warm at night. Building it using everyday material available around the house was cheap and did not require additional expenses.

# Geoarchaeological models of earthen floor formation

The "earth floor" is quite a complex term (Rentzel et al. 2017). Previous research suggests a floor will have three parts: passive, reactive and active layers (Gé et al. 1993; Courty et al. 1994; summarized and expanded upon by Macphail and Goldberg 2017). Trampling plays a very important role in the modification of the floor (Rentzel et al. 2017).

The passive layer consists of different types of material including a sedimentary layer, surface soil horizon, dumped waste, ground raising or constructed floor (intentionally prepared floor) or floor covering (Macphail and Goldberg 2017). According to the authors who proposed this model (Gé et al. 1993 expanded upon by Macphail and Goldberg 2017), the passive layer has no deformation or incorporation of human residues related to accumulation events and processes on the activity surface and all the features are inherited from previous activities/formation. In contrast, the reactive layer is formed by the mechanical deformation of the passive layer. This layer usually has voids represented as fissures and channels and also contains some microaggregates. The incorporation of human residues is limited. Finally, the active layer results from trampling. The resultant product is a heterogeneous, microlaminated structure with the incorporation of human refuse (see review of Macphail and Goldberg 2017). The material used for the floor construction depends on the local geology, climate, the type of settlement and the function of the building (Macphail and Goldberg 2017; Milek 2012; Nornberg and Courty 1985). Purposely constructed loam floors usually resurface previously accumulated (trampled and beaten) waste debris (Karkanas and Van de Moortel 2014; Macphail et al. 2004; Rentzel 2011; Jarosova et al. 2016; Matthews 1995, 2003; Shillito and Ryan 2013; Banerjea et al. 2015a, 2015b).

# Ethnographic testimonies of floor construction and maintenance

Historical information about earth floor construction and its everyday maintenance, or periodic floor care, is quite limited. The

main source of information concerning earth floors are Eastern European ethnographic works (Novotny 2014; Ondrejka 2008; Macek 1986; Dobsinsky 1880). From these works, we know that the construction of a floor began with beating and/or levelling of the former surface and was followed with the application of loose loam. Sometimes sand was spread over the surface. From time to time, the sprinkling of water followed by sweeping was used as a type of occasional floor care (Macek 1968). The water was sprinkled on the surface probably for two main reasons. At first it prevented floor erosion; secondly it was a form of art as the water was sprinkled in patterns forming visual patterns (pictures) that surprisingly remained visible on the surface for up to several weeks. Also, one method of floor preparation consisted of application of loose loam mixed with animal dung. In some cases, lime was also added into the loam used for preparation or reparation of the floor (Novotny 2014). The occasional, or even regular (weekly) floor care, usually entailed wetting and sweeping or dry sweeping when necessary (Novotny 2014). More intensive floor care consisted of the application of a thin layer of additional loose loam mixed with cow or horse dung (Novotny 2014). Additional information from the ethnographic sources mostly refers to care of floors only on special occasions. For example, before Christmas, rooms should be dry-swept in the direction out of the house using a new broomstick (to prevent the spread of fleas) and a small amount of corn or walnuts was to be spread about in the corners of the house (Ondrejka 2008). In addition, hay was laid on the floor in some cases during Christmas time so that people could walk on a green surface (Dobšinsky 1880). Such practices were mostly connected to religious beliefs. Sometimes, wood fragments were dumped on kitchen floors (Ondrejka 2008), probably depending on the function and importance of the room.

The main aim of the paper is to provide a reference for floor construction and maintenance, demonstrate how the microstructure of the constructed floor appears after 19 years of floor maintenance (at least  $4\mathrm{x}$  per year) and how this floor structure fits into the general model/concept proposed by Gé et al. (1993), modified by Courty et al. (1994) and recently generally accepted (Macphail and Goldberg 2017).

The detailed protocol of floor construction followed by repeated re-plastering is described by Mrs. Ježković (Dolní Němčí museum curator). Is it also possible to detect similar type of floor care practices in the former floors preserved below a recently prepared floor? Did the floor care practices change over time over the last two centuries? How does the sedimentary record within the earth floor differ between the kitchen and the main passage through the living room? And what is the relative rate of floor layer accumulation? Or is the micromorphological study of recent floors combined with the ethnographical knowledge and macroremain analyses a valuable methodological approach for the interpretation of archaeological situations? Do the macroremains indicate the activities within the house, or is their presence connected mainly with the construction and maintenance of the floor?

# Materials and methods

# The study area and its history

Mill No. 105 in Dolni Němčí is located in the eastern part of the Czech Republic near Uherské Hradistě (Fig. 1). The geological substrate consists of Paleogene marine calcareous clays and silts partially overlain by loess and loess-like sediments. The mill is captured on the map of the so-called imperial or Francis cadaster from 1824. The building existing today (Fig. 2) is a result of several modifications testified by its constructional details and surviving date plaques (1762 on the fireplace beam—probably reused, 1864 on the beam of an all-purpose living room ceiling). It remained in operation at least until the end of the nineteenth century. In 1914, part of the complex was destroyed by fire (Spathová 1999; Urbančík 1999; Slinták 2008).

The buildings of the mill were permanently occupied until 1973. In that year, its owners left the country and until 1989 the mill, listed since 1968 as a cultural monument of the Czech Republic, remained abandoned and closed to the public. After the "Velvet Revolution" of 1989, the local government purchased the mill and in 1998 a museum was opened.

The mill includes one two-storey (in part) building made of mudbricks and covered by lime. The internal structure of the mill is divided into three basic parts: the mill itself (later also used as a stable and granary), the miller's house and the barn (Fig. 2). The floors in all rooms of the miller's house before the reconstruction were earthen floors (heritage list record from 1963/66 see Popelka 1990). The only metric survey was elaborated in 1990 (Motyčka 1990). Local historical

sources (Popelka 1990) describe the black kitchen (first sampling point) as covered by sundried bricks and the floor of the all-purpose living room (second sampling point) as possessing a wooden floor. The discrepancies between these two descriptions are easily clarified by the time span between them. The mudbrick floor in the black kitchen and the wooden floor in the main living room were probably added in the period between the first official record in 1966 and the second in 1990 (Popelka 1990).

Mrs. Marie Ježková (born in 1936), an 82-year-old local inhabitant (born and raised in the village), started to prepare an earthen floor in 1998 according to inherited knowledge and she maintains the floor to this day. The knowledge of how to prepare, repair and maintain the floor is passed in the village from mother to daughter. In 1998, Mrs. Ježková was employed as a curator of the museum as her knowledge allows her to practice the regional customs and she works with local folklore clubs. She buried the former floor below a new passive layer and thus provided us with a unique opportunity to compare the formation of the former floor with the new one with both being prepared by similar maintenance practices.

# Methodological approach

Two mammoth-sized micromorphological samples were collected from the kitchen and the main corridor in the living room during 2016 with the aim of document the structure of a floor with well-known formation processes. As we realized later, the samples cover the stratigraphic record of the former as well the recent floor. The samples were dried and then impregnated by Polyllite 2000 and thin-sectioned in the

laboratory at Ghent University. Finally, three thin sections (approximately  $10 \times 5$  cm in size) (see Fig. 3) were made from the sampled material. The micromorphological observations were described and interpreted according to Stoops (2003), Stoops et al. (2010) and Nicosia and Stoops (2017).

The chemical composition of the recently prepared as well as the former floor surfaces was studied using an electron microprobe JEOL 6490LV with EDX microprobe (Oxford Instruments), for component distribution analysis. The reason was to determine the main chemical differences between the recent and the former floor. Maps were loaded for  $4800\mathrm{s}$  with an accelerating voltage of  $15\mathrm{kV}$ . Photos were taken in a low vacuum in regime of BSE. The results were recounted to  $100\%$ .

The macroremain analyses were performed with the aim to identify the type and possibly also the source of the organic material in the floor. The identification of macroremains was performed in two ways. The first step was to determine the

macroremains from thin sections. This allows the original structure with the macroremains and phytoliths in their original sedimentary context to be observed. However, the statistical processing is very difficult in this context. For this reason, two sets of blocks were originally taken from the floor located in the main corridor of the living room. One of them was used for the thin sectioning (see Fig. 3, i.e. two thin sections from that context). The second block was resampled according to the layers as detected by the micromorphological observations, and then the material was studied using the standard procedure. Fragments of charcoal and other plant macroremains (mostly plant seeds and fruits) were separated from these samples by wet sieving (Carcaillet and Talon 1996; Pearsall 1989) using sieves with a mesh size of  $1\mathrm{mm}$ . Charcoal pieces and plant macroremains were manually separated from the sieved fractions. Macroremains were identified using Cappers et al. (2006) and reference collections of seeds and fruits of Central European plants (Department of

Charcoal was taxonomically analysed using an episcopic microscope at 100, 200 and  $300\times$  magnifications using the microscopic anatomical criteria (Schweingruber 1990) and compared with a charcoal reference collection (Institute of Archaeology, Czech Academy of Sciences). Taxonomic determinations and the nomenclature follow Danihelka et al. (2012).

# Results and discussion

# Original construction of the recent floor

A detailed description of the preparation and maintenance of the floor provided by Mrs. Ježková helped us to understand the formation processes of single layers. She prepared the components and started to demonstrate the process of maintenance.

1) "First you have to mix soil that has no stones (i.e. the local loess-like deposits) with enough water (but not too much), with dung, straw and chaff. It should be barley chaff, but with modern technologies this is nearly impossible." In the past, such soil was collected on the roadside after heavy rain. It was also used for repairing the existing floor.  
2) "When you prepare the mix, you should spread it on the ground, the thickness is up to you, but it usually equates to  $2 - 7\mathrm{cm}$ . I started to prepare the floor in late summer and,

unfortunately, it didn't dry perfectly. The autumn was quite cool and it started freezing. So, I tried to repair it. I smashed the surface where small ice wedges had appeared and added a new surface. Finally, everything went well so I applied the final stage of the floor."

3) "The final coating should be repeated once a week. It was customary to do it every Saturday, but I only do it four times a year (unfortunately)." Mrs. Ježková spread water over the surface (using a brush) (Fig. 4b). After a while, she spread cow dung over the wet floor (Fig. 4c) (she said horse dung is also a good choice) and she immediately covered the surface by chaff (Fig. 4d); (while complaining how difficult it is to obtain chaff as manual corn threshing is no longer pursued in modern agriculture). When the surface becomes dried, she swept the floor, and the floor was ready to be stepped on.

# Composition of the recent floor from the sedimentary record

The micromorphological samples revealed two main types of strata (Fig. 3) divided into subfacies (MFT—micro-facial types, see Table 1). The first strata (MFT1 and MFT2) represent the recent floor constructed and maintained by Mrs. Ježková. The second strata (MFT3–MFT8) has accumulated over the last 200 years and displays a set of laminae representing the former floor (Fig. 3) that accumulated before the site became a museum. Significant differences were

detected between the "recent floor" and the former floor(s). At the same time, similarities between the kitchen area and the main corridor in the living room in the recent, as well as in the former floor layers, were revealed (Table 1).

We know the step-by-step preparation of the recently prepared floor thanks to Mrs. Ježková's detailed description (see "Original construction of the recent floor"); therefore, within these strata, we should expect two MFTs with substantially different compositions. The passive layer should contain less organic matter and no horizontal orientation of the matrix, while the final coating should be microlayered and should contain a lot of chaff and decomposed organic matter from the dung. MFT1 and MFT2 were identified and described, but their compositions do not appear to differ significantly (Table 1). Nearly 20 years of repeated dung coating (MFT1) did not fully survive as microlayers because it slowly mixed with the passive layer (MFT2).

The differences between MFT1 and MFT2 are very small and mostly relate to the types of pores (horizontal x cracks), density and the amount of mineral and organic matter (Table 1). Only the kitchen sample contained within its MFT1 a well-developed thin "crust" of horizontally oriented organic residues laying on the moderately sorted silty loam. In the main corridor of the living room, which had been maintained and trampled more intensively, MFT1 was already beaten into the construction/passive layer (MFT2). The construction layer (MFT2), then, is a mix of silty material with

well-preserved organic matter and occasional presence of microcharcoal. Pores (planes), which are typical postdepositional feature indicating intensive beating, are very rare in studied layer, so it is uncertain whether this layer was mechanically influenced reactive layer or not (Macphail and Goldberg 2017). Repeated dung re-plastering in MFT1 should be understood as a type of reactive layer because these layers slowly mix with the underlying construction (passive) layer (MFT2). At the same time, these newly aggraded layers are influenced by trampling. Due to the maintenance (repeated re-plastering by dung), the active layer is no longer preserved. Although it is certain that the dung was used as a plaster, no dung spherulites survived. The probable reasons are the long-term oxidation of the surface prior to the next maintenance event and the acidic character of the recent floor (see Fig. 5 and description of element analyses in "Similarities and differences between the recent and older floor sequences"). Polyconcave vertical cracks in the lower part of the recently constructed floor (MFT2) have been observed in the micromorphological samples. The presence of this feature can be explained as the effect of trampling (Rentzel et al. 2017) or may attest to the problem Mrs. Ježková was dealing with when curing the floor. These cracks may therefore have developed due to freezing during the drying process of floor construction. In this case, as a result of their presence, we can more easily evaluate which part of the strata represents the construction floor (MFT2) not influenced by the re-plastering.

*Sample A  
**Sample B

The recently prepared floor (MFT1 & MFT2) included leaves of monocotyledonous plants  $(10 - 15\%)$ , chaff  $(10 - 15\%)$  and stems of monocotyledonous plants  $(10 - 15\%)$ . Greater amounts of these macroremains (around  $15\%$  ) were observed in the thin "crust layer" marked as MFT1. The layer below the crust constituting the main mass of the recently prepared floor (MFT2) contained not only smaller quantities of macroremains (around  $10\%$  ) but also rare relics of deciduous wood charcoal, cereal grains and seeds of dicotyledonous plants. The detailed analyses of macroremains revealed (Table 2) that macroremains identified in the recent preparation layer as well as in the "crust" are typical only for the modern era, as the presence of barley (Hordeum vulgare), wheat (Triticum aestivum) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa) attest to.

Apart from macroremains of crop assemblages, unambiguous rubble/segetal site species are also present in both MFT1 and MFT2 including Echinochloa crus-galli, Fallopia convolvulus, Chenopodium album, Polygonum arenastrum, Polygonum persicaria, Rumex obtusifolius, Cirsium arvense and Elytrigia repens. Typical segetal species (corn weeds) were detected only rarely (Papaver rhoeas, Vicia hirsuta and Sinapis arvensis). Mrs. Ježková pointed out that chaff was the main material used in past for floor care, but with the recently used technologies, it was nearly impossible to get chaff without straw, so she used a mix of chaff and straw instead. The macroremain analyses confirmed that most of the organic material comes from the cleaning of recently planted cereals (barley and wheat) and aggressive rubble/segetal weeds resistant to modern herbicides. Therefore, it is difficult to state what proportion of the organic matter derives from dung (i.e. the organic matter used for animal feeding) and what proportion derives from the final stage of floor care (chaff and straw spreading). The small amount of charcoal and wood fragments detected in the recent layers was probably already

present as part of the loam material Mrs. Ježková collected in the field.

# Composition of former floors

The "former" floor is composed of a series of layers (MFT, see Table 1), usually less than  $1\mathrm{cm}$  thick composed of Ca rich matrix (see Fig. 5 and description in "Similarities and differences between the recent and older floor sequences"). Some of these layers contain more or less continuous bands (few hundred microns in thickness, see Fig. 3) composed of a silty fraction commonly containing calcareous rock fragments, sometimes burnt matrix, and rarely the remains of calcareous plaster. This could originate during the re-plastering, when the plaster from the walls, and the dust brought in on feet were mixed into the new floor dung application. This process has already been observed in many archaeological or experimental case studies (Matthews 1995, 2003; Macphail et al. 2004; Milek 2012; Shillito and Ryan 2013; Banerjea et al. 2015a, 2015b). These layers (MFT3-MFT8) recorded below the recent floor were intentionally applied and postdepositionally changed probably in the same way as Mrs. Ježková reported for the recent floor. The main reason for this suggestion is the ethnographical record given by Mrs. Ježková whose family lives in the village for several generations. Another reason is that the continuous maintenance described above by Mrs. Ježková produces homogenous layers comparable with those preserved below the recent floor. The active floor layer is in fact the product of two main triggers. On the one hand, the aggradation of organic plaster by the week maintenance and, on the other hand, the continuous mixing of that plaster with the trampled dust may produce such homogeny layer. It is a question if to call such layer as an active one or reactive one. We propose to call such horizons "construction reactive layers" developed by trampling on prepared floors

(Rentzel et al. 2017). In contrast to Macphail and Goldberg (2017), we were able to detect in detail the re-plastering procedure, i.e. the composition of the organic plaster. One of the horizons (MFT4) is rich in charcoal, organic residues, articulated

phytoliths and microcrystalline plaster and gypsum (Table 1; Fig. 6). This layer (MFT4) probably represents horizon (active trampled layer) accumulated during the reconstruction activities that followed the large fire in 1914. The horizontal planes

resulting from repeated beating (Macphail and Goldberg 2017) are well-developed throughout the entire section (MFT3-MFT8), which indicate that eventually all the construction and active layers become reactive layers due to the continuous mixing during the maintenance and use of the floor.

The macroremain analysis performed using the thin sections revealed a different composition in the individual MFT detected by micromorphological observation (Table 1). The light layer marked as MFT3 contained mainly amorphous, decomposed or partly decomposed, organic matter interpreted as dung (containing dung spherulites), stems of monocotyledonous plants  $(5\%)$  and occasionally also microcharcoal. The macroremain analyses of this material revealed the same

composition as the recent layers (Table 2), which relatively date the age of this layer to the time when modern agricultural techniques were used (modern method of barley and wheat separation and cleaning, the use of herbicides occurred probably from the 1950s). The dark layer marked as MFT4 contained a large proportion of microcharcoal (plus  $5\%$  of wood fragments) originating from elm, coniferous trees and deciduous trees. Relics of amorphous organic matter interpreted as dung and stems of monocotyledonous plants  $(10\%)$  forms another component of the MFT4. The macroremain and anthracological analyses revealed that this layer has relatively few plant macroremains (Table 2). The main taxonomic groups detected include barley, wheat and

some weed species (Sinapis arvensis, Vicia hirsuta). Botanically, the MFT4 layer is similar in composition to the underlying layers. Charcoal detected in this layer typically contained oak (Quercus) and deciduous trees that could not be identified more precisely. The remaining MFT detected micromorphologically had very similar compositions of organic macroremains to the previously described MFT4. These include MFT5-7 characterized by the presence of stems of monocotyledonous plants  $(10\%)$ , leaves of monocotyledonous plants  $(< 10\%)$ , very common opaque organic matter and rare microcharcoal, stems and seeds of dicotyledonous plants  $(< 1\%)$ . Macroremains observed in these layers typically contain relicts of barley (chaff and ear internodia) and, to a smaller extent, wheat. Segetal plants that frequently grow in wheat fields (e.g. Ranunculus arvensis, Sinapis arvensis, Valeriana dentata and Vicia hirsute) were detected. Rubble site species included Anthemis arvesis, Cirsium arvense, Lamium cf. album and Sonchus asper. The study material

therefore indicates the presence of waste from traditional production of barley, and it also reflects the landscape of a preindustrial village practicing animal grazing. The presence of Ranunculus arvensis, Valerianella dentate and Anthemis arvensis provides a relative date for the age of the floor because these species are absent in the study area due to a recent change in agricultural practices and/or management of rubble site areas (see the Plalias 2014-2018 database - https://plalias.cz/en/). The small bone fragments and fragments of Prunus fruit (Prunus insititia/domestica) were also present in the floor.

The main differences among the individual layers MFT3-MFT8 were caused by the type of material used for the renovation of the surface or in the type of material, which had been dumped on the floor due to unusual conditions (for example, a fire event). The layer marked as MFT4 containing ubiquitous microcharcoal fragments illustrates this well. We suspect that this horizon may have been formed in 1914 when part of the mill burnt down and the remaining rooms that were not affected

by the fire continued to be used. The charcoal could have been brought on boot soles. This scenario is difficult to confirm due to the large statistical error in C14 dating; nevertheless, the "charcoal layer" appears both in the kitchen and the main corridor of the living room more or less in the same stratigraphic position. The uppermost part of the former floor in the kitchen is missing (upper part of MFT3). The reason is that during construction works in 1997-1998, part of the old floor (already mudbricks at the time) was removed during levelling.

# Similarities and differences between the recent and older floor sequences

The provenance of the material for the former floors differs from the recently prepared floor for a simple reason. Mrs. Ježkova reported that the material for levelling was usually collected along roads after heavy rain when wet mud was still available. When she started to prepare the floor, she used some muddy material from the field, but the field was obviously located on loess substrates, while the mud from the rain in roadside canals originated from Paleogene calcareous clays and silts that form the background geology of this area. The element distribution maps (Fig. 5) show that the recently prepared floors have more Si, in this case represented by fine grained quartz, which is ubiquitous in the loess material of southern Moravia (Lisá et al. 2013). In contrast to the former floors, the amount of Ca and Al is very low (Fig. 5). The thin layer rich in Ca was optically detected few millimetres below the surface (Fig. 3, the layer below the MFT1; Fig. 5 experimental floor, Ca content). Because the recently prepared floor was constructed without adding lime, the high concentration of Ca is likely linked to postdepositional processes when the acid dung reacts with water and the underlying loess sediment. This results in the leaching of Ca down the profile. The Ca horizon therefore marks the depth that the percolating solutions reach.

The differences in provenance of source material used for the two different floor sequences are the reason why the former floors were poorly sorted, calcareous, containing microcrystalline aggregates, limestone clasts and siltstone or sandstone calcareous clasts. The element distribution map (Fig. 5) shows abundance of Ca and Al rich minerals, which reflect, in turn, the presence of Paleogene calcareous clays. The appearance of lime plaster in the bottom part of the sample can be explained in two ways. It is either the remains of intentional preparation of a plaster floor as reported by Sveinbjarnardóttir et al. (2007) from the Reykholt farm and by Novotny (2014), or more likely, it is the result of unintentional dispersion of plaster material during plastering of the walls. A similar scenario can also be employed to explain the occurrence of fine-grained gypsum.

Using the example of the recently prepared floor, one can clearly observe that in the intensively used area (the main corridor of the living room), the organic residues accumulated on

the top floor layer (active layer) do not survive as a layer but are worked into the floor and intermixed with the background (Fig. 6a). A new maintenance layer was thus applied on the mix of silt and organic residues. Mrs. Ježková insists there was no sweeping done (despite the dry sweeping after the dung replastering), so the floor was not subjected to sheet erosion. On the other hand, the active layer of the floor could accumulate only due to the new application of a dung layer (which does not contain a mineral fraction) or due to re-levelling (only certain areas where holes appear) or due to aggradation of material brought in on shoe soles. It is reported that the floor was maintained every week (information provided by Mrs. Ježková and the museum archive), but it was also used much more intensively (up to 15 people at a time lived in the house). The presence of the charcoal in the floor is not necessarily linked to the dumped material. If people collected the construction material for floors along roadsides as reported by Mrs. Ježková, this material could have already a high microcharcoal content.

One of the differences between the recently prepared floor and the former floor is that the greater compactness of the former floor (Fig. 3) represented also by the lower porosity of the former floor. There may be several reasons for it. As stated above, the material used for the floor preparation differs, the intensity of the floor care differs and the number of people living in the mill differs. All these factors influence the floor formation processes. Water and dung spread over the surface of the floor are bound to change the pH and to initiate illuviation of leachable minerals (mainly carbonates), which impregnate and compact the layers below (Fig. 6a, approx.  $2\mathrm{mm}$  below the surface, in PPL visible only as a less porous layer).

Greater intensity of floor re-plastering also results in a greater amount of decomposed organic matter associated with the application of dung. Although we can be certain that dung was applied in the preparation of the recent floor, it is difficult to differentiate the dung from the dry organic material added to the loam matrix of the floor because of the absence of dung spherulites. On the other hand, the dung material is easily detectable in the former floor layers (due to the presence of the dung spherulites, see Fig. 6f), and it links the micromorphological observations with the floor care practices as observed by the local people and described by Novotny (2014) based on ethnographic sources. It seems that there are no differences between the floor stratigraphy observed in the kitchen and the living room (Fig. 3), which suggest that both of these rooms were maintained in the same way.

# Implications for archaeological research

Archaeologists often deal with sedimentary structures interpreted as floors (Matthews et al. 1997; Borderie et al. 2018). There are various ways of detecting floors, for example from the position of the "in situ" artefacts, horizontal layering as in the case of the Dolni Němčí study case study or simply

the local context of the layers. If the shape of the object is not preserved, the floors are usually detected from changes in structure or changes in colour of sediments. On the other hand, there are known contexts with clear outlines of houses, where identification of floors is extremely difficult. Good examples are Late Medieval and Modern Age abandoned villages buried under recent forest vegetation (Lisá et al. in print-a). When the focus of these studies is element distributions (Milek et al. 2012; Macphail and Goldberg 2018) or macroremain compositions (Courty et al. 1989), inferences can be made about the use of space. The study of the Dolní Němčí floors casts light on the different uses of space (kitchen versus the main corridor of the living room) with the resultant differences in floor sedimentology. Surprisingly, in this case the differences appear minor. The presence of organic coating not trampled into the floor in the uppermost part of the recent floor in kitchen is not, in our opinion, significant. It seems that the coating preserved because since the last maintenance the area was not trampled. Furthermore, it was possible to correlate the main horizons between two spaces that were used for different purposes.

In spite of the fact that studies of experimental floor deposits are not uncommon (Macphail et al. 2004, Banerjea et al. 2015a, 2015b; Matthews et al. 2000; Millek et al. 2012; Kramer 1982; La Motta and Schiffer 1999; Rentzel et al. 2017), most of the open-air museums have earth floors as part of the exhibition with no documentation of their formation. The Dolni Němčí case study is probably the only example in Czech Republic where the long-term formation of the floor is documented. The possibility of interview with the person who prepared the floor according the knowledge passed from the ancestors makes the study quite unique.

Based on our field experiences, field archaeologist sometimes perceive that a floor layer is just one layer with specific parameters, but in fact, the floor may possess complicated strata especially when it appears well layered (Macphail and Goldberg 2017; Rentzel et al. 2017). Therefore, the knowledge about the floor formation may help to the field archaeologist to interpret sequences and associations of building activities. The floor captures traces of the preparation and sometimes also information about the use and abandonment of the house (Novák et al. 2012, Kuna et al. 2013, Dejmal et al. 2014, Borderie et al. 2018). The final product is affected by all of these steps. The organic residues within the floor were in most cases introduced intentionally as part of the floor care, and they do not represent the refuse material. This should be important information for archaeobotanical interpretations because the archaeobotanical data will reflect the animal food, i.e. the dung composition instead of the type of food processing activities within the house. Unfortunately, to divide the organic matter from the dung and organic matter from the dung processing seems to be nearly impossible especially in the case when the macroremain samples are separated/ prepared for observation by classical flotations and sampling

does not reflects the presence of microlayers. Sets of laminated floors of recently abandoned houses along the Prut River, eastern Romania, were recently described (Lisá et al. in printb.). Similar types of maintenance as at Dolni Němčí were documented, but there are differences in the plastering and trampling because the floors were heavily used and maintained only once a year, with the plaster containing a mixture of dung and soil. It is vital that more examples of floors are studied in detail because the floor composition may obviously bring a lot of new information for the understanding of human behavioural practices. Archaeological interpretations should take into the account in building archaeological interpretations that the percolating solutions may significantly change the chemistry, redeposit the fine-grained particles or trigger the formation of new minerals. The old floor material may be incorporated into the new floor. It is evident that the intensity of these processes depends on the use of space, local conditions and the type of floor care.

# Summary and conclusions

Earth floors are important archives that may reflect the way people use the space and also their cultural customs. Knowledge of these processes, i. e. the way floors were maintained and used, can be achieved with interdisciplinary research. The comparison study of the recently prepared floor with the former floor that accumulated over the last 200 years shows that floors may capture the evidence about cultural changes or events, which occurred at the time. The composition of Mrs. Ježková's recent floor is consistent with her description of a "preparation protocol" and provides us with a unique opportunity to study and understand its formation process.

The recently prepared floor was maintained for 18 years, but unfortunately only 4 times per year, evidently using a different type of material. Due to this fact, many features that occur in the former floor did not develop in the recent floor (post-sedimentary features such as impregnations, growth of vivianite, iron nodules and accumulations of spherulites), or they did not preserve e.g. due to oxidation (dung spherulites). Despite these differences, it is possible to apply the knowledge from the recently prepared floor (MFT1-2) to the understanding of the formation of the former floor (MFT3-8). One of the key implications is the identification of the effects of beating and replastering. In fact, the passive layer is constructed and immediately transforms into the reactive layer. The active layer is not usually preserve, but when it does, it is immediately incorporated into the passive (construction) layer. In cases where the active layer (MFT4) is preserved, it is a reflection of an unusual event, such as fire damage followed by reconstruction. This paper highlights the issue of understanding the concept of the passive-reactive-active layer as these slightly laminated layers, usually interpreted as passive layers or trampled layers, are in

fact a mix of passive, reactive and active formation processes (and not merely the single application of the construction layer).

The macroremain analyses revealed that the material used for the re-plastering reflects modern agricultural practices, i.e. the types of plants observed did not grow in the study area before the adoption of modern agricultural practices. Thus we were able to use macroremain analysis as a form of relative dating of the youngest parts of the former floor.

The former floor is much more variable in its composition. This is due to intensive postdepositional processes and differing primary lithology. The social habits remained unchanged, and this is reflected in the sandwich-like structure of the floor, which indicates similar type of floor maintenance in the past. Small differences in the post-sedimentary changes may have diverse reasons reflecting cultural or personal habits. For example, the space could have been used all year round (i.e. the application of water and humic acids was more intensive and/or the number of people using the rooms had a greater impact on the floor), the person working in the kitchen was not the same person all the time or there were more people living in the house. The old floor has much more trampled material beaten into it than the recently prepared floor. This fact surely reflects the different intensity of activities inside the house, i.e. the change from temporally occupied house into the museum. The presence of a layer rich in charcoal, which appeared in the kitchen and the living room in approximately the same stratigraphic position, can be linked to the major mill fire in 1914. Consequently, the organic residues used for the floor construction below the charcoal layer were expected to reflect the old agricultural practices and a landscape that no longer exists in the study area. It was possible to confirm this with macroremain composition as a form of relative dating.

The investigations clearly show that the macromains do not indicate the activities within the house (no de facto refuse) (Schiffer 1987) but relate to the construction and maintenance of the floor. This is a very important result for the interpretation of archaeological/archaeobotanical data.

Application of this methodological approach has significant potential for the interpretations of the archaeological record connected with the determination of cultural customs.
