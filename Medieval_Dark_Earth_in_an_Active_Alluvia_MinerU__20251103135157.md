Archaeological excavations at the Biblioteca Magliabechiana, which is part of the Uffizi gallery complex in Florence (Tuscany, central Italy), exposed Dark Earth deposits between alluvial sediments of the nearby Arno River. The term Dark Earth refers to thick, dark colored, and seemingly homogeneous deposits occurring in urban settings throughout Europe, broadly dated to the post-Roman period. The stratigraphic sequence of the Biblioteca Magliabechiana was investigated by integrating geomorphological, chronological, and archaeological information with micromorphological and soil analytical data. This combination of approaches resulted in the identification of an early phase of Dark Earth formation (7th century A.D.) during which the area was characterized by the accumulation of manure or night soil in wet peri-fluvial conditions. After a phase of abandonment, Dark Earth accretion resumed (10th to early 11th century A.D.), at this stage due primarily to the dumping of domestic waste. Subsequent progressive abandonment of the area was followed by the deposition of alluvium, probably during the major flood of November 4, 1177. The present study demonstrates that Dark Earth is the outcome of strong bioturbation and human reworking acting on anthropogenic deposits and possibly on alluvial sediments. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

# INTRODUCTION

The term Dark Earth refers to dark, seemingly homogeneous, thick deposits found in urban settings, generally dated to the post-Roman period (see Macphail, Galinie, & Verhaeghe, 2003; Galinie, 2004; Fondrillon, 2007; Macphail, 2010). Interest in Dark Earth has developed since the late 1970s throughout Europe in relation to the study of the transformation of urban space after the collapse of the Roman Empire. Research into these sediments has taken place on sites in the United Kingdom (Carver, 1987; Yule, 1990), Italy (Brogiolo, Cremaschi, & Gelichi, 1988; Gelichi, 1997; Nicosia, 2006), France (Boissavit-Camus, 2000; Fondrillon, 2007), and elsewhere. Since the early 1980s (Macphail, 1981; 1983), geoarchaeological and especially soil micromorphological analyses have demonstrated that, in many cases, Dark

Earth is the outcome of reworking of a once-complex deposit by pedological processes, in particular by bioturbation and weathering (Courty, Goldberg, & Macphail, 1989; Macphail, 1994; Macphail & Goldberg, 1995; Goldberg & Macphail, 2006). Geoarchaeological studies have revealed that many diverse, superimposed activities and processes are involved in the formation of urban Dark Earth (Fondrillon, 2007; Nicosia, Devos, & Macphail, submitted). These consist, for example, of the repeated dumping of waste (Cammas, Courty, & Fedoroff, 1998; Cammas, 2004), cultivation and manuring (Cremaschi, 1992; Macphail, 1994; Devos et al., 2007; Devos et al., 2009), human dwelling alternating with phases of flooding (Cremaschi & Nicosia, 2010), stabling of animals, and decay of insubstantial buildings (Macphail, 1994; Macphail & Goldberg, 1995).

reworking, bioturbation (rodents, earthworms, enchymraeidae, plant roots), and weathering of earth-based and organic construction materials have been reported to cause the obliteration of any original stratification or sedimentary structure (Macphail, 1994; Macphail & Linderholm, 2004; Goldberg & Macphail, 2006).

Rescue archaeological excavations (2005 to 2006) inside the Biblioteca Magliabechiana, which is part of the Uffizi gallery complex in Florence (Figures 1, 2, 3), revealed the occurrence of deposits with Dark Earth characteristics. This site is located outside the wall enclosure that, from the end of the 1st century B.C., encircled the Roman city of Florentia, in a buffer zone between the Arno River and the city (Cantini et al., 2009; Francovich et al., 2007; Cantini et al., 2007; see Figure 1). The area of the Magliabechiana was urbanized only from the late Middle Ages onward (13th century) due to the frequent floods of the Arno. While Dark Earth deposits were forming at the site of the Biblioteca Magliabechiana, the urban fabric of Florence was disintegrating. Dark Earths appear within the Roman walls as well as in the nearby nonurbanized suburbs that were subject to flooding from the Arno River, at least since the 4th century. From the 4th century onward, and especially during the 6th and 7th centuries, numerous buildings in Florence were aban-

doned, dismantled, or modified. In this period, the Roman theatre, located a few meters from the excavation, ceased to be used as a theatre and became the site of a small cemetery. Later, after having been subjected to heavy robbing, it became an area where thick Dark Earth deposits accumulated between the 7th and the 11th centuries. Similarly, the great baths of Piazza della Signoria fell out of use, and huts constructed of perishable materials were built on them. Meanwhile, new churches redefined the urban space of the city, creating new population centers (Cantini et al. 2009; Francovich et al. 2007). In this context of significant changes in the cityscape of Florence, the area of the Magliabechiana was a space with rural characteristics until the end of the 11th century, when it was enclosed by new city walls and was subsequently absorbed into the urban sprawl of the  $13^{\text{th}}$  century.

This paper is based on the study of three stratigraphic profiles exposed during the aforementioned archaeological excavation at the Biblioteca Magliabechiana, which were selected for physicochemical and micromorphological soil analyses (Figures 4, 5, 6). The results of this study are presented here and discussed in terms of the broader geomorphological, chronological, and archaeological context of the study area.

# SITE CONTEXT

# Site Geomorphology and Environment

The city of Florence is located in the eastern part of the Florence-Prato-Pistoia basin (Figure 1). This basin is elongated NW-SE, with a length of  $45\mathrm{km}$  and a maximum width of  $10\mathrm{km}$ . The average elevation is 45 to  $50\mathrm{m}$  above sea level. The basin is a depression of tectonic origin, filled by Quaternary lacustrine and fluvial deposits, and surrounded by hills and low mountains with a Mesozoic and Tertiary rock substrate. Belts of "Villafranchian" lacustrine deposits connect the higher relief with the valley floor (Lazzarotto, 1993; Dainelli, 1936; Servizio Geologico d'Italia, 1967). The city was founded on a slightly elevated stretch of the valley floor, which was probably created by neotectonic uplift along faults. It is located about  $10\mathrm{km}$  downstream from the gorge of Incisa, where the Arno River, after having received a major tributary, accumulates a considerable amount of sediment, particularly during floods. In the tract between the

gorge and the city, the Arno is a braided river characterized by a rather unpredictable hydraulic regime. Near the city, the river runs along the southern edge of the valley, which was probably the case throughout historical times. The excavation area may well have been especially exposed to floods, not only due to narrowing of the valley imposed by the local topography, and later on by the city walls and the river embankments, but also due to the stratigraphic configuration of the valley. In fact, near the city, the pre-Quaternary substrate under the infill is closer to the surface than anywhere else in the valley, being located at approximately  $50\mathrm{-m}$  depth. Moreover, under the excavation area, the depth at which the substrate is found diminishes even more, to only 12 to  $20\mathrm{m}$  from the surface. Furthermore, the hydraulically most conductive, gravelly part of the alluvial infill reaches its maximum thickness in this area. These conditions would have pushed the groundwater to the surface and therefore aggravated the impact of floods in this part of the city. Generally, flood sediments tend not to be preserved in the archaeological record because they are either removed by human activity or washed away by subsequent events. However, in this particular area of the town, the layers

were trapped in a small sedimentation basin delimited by the embankments of the Arno and its Fosso Scheraggio tributary (Figure 1), and by the slight uphill gradient of the natural relief upon which the town was founded (see Figure 2). For the same reason, particular layers, such as Dark Earth deposits, could slowly accumulate and remain well-preserved in this area. More detailed information on the geomorphology and Quaternary geology of the city can be found in Arnoldus-Huyzendveld (2007), Coli et al. (2004), and Pallecchi, Benvenuti & Cianferoni (2010).

# Chronology of Dark Earth and Alluvial Layers in Florence

Floods have been recorded in Florence from the 12th century onward (Losacco, 1967; see also Coli et al., 2004) based on records that also allow for comparison between historical accounts and radiocarbon dates of alluvial episodes. For the Biblioteca Magliabechiana site, radiocarbon dates are available from three stratigraphic sequences (Fedi et al., 2007), one of which is discussed in the present study (Profile 1). In Table I and Figure 7, an

overview of  $^{14}\mathrm{C}$  results for Profile 1 is given (from Fedi et al., 2007). Eight charcoal or seed samples were analyzed from a succession of stratigraphic units, including five samples extracted from Dark Earth at regular 10-cm intervals (Figure 4). Dates for the two uppermost samples of the Dark Earth unit are considered to be unreliable because they are highly inconsistent with the others. In the sequence from the Biblioteca Magliabechiana, three different floods or periods of flooding are identifiable. The oldest flooding stage took place in the 3rd to 4th century A.D. The next is dated to the 6th to 7th century A.D., possibly corresponding to the major flood of 589 A.D., which is known from historical sources to have occurred throughout Italy, but which has up to now not been identified in Florence (Arnoldus-Huyzendveld, 2007). The most recent flood layer dates from the 12th century and can be interpreted to be the result of the major flood recorded in Florence on November 4th, 1177 A.D. Dark Earth formation at the Biblioteca Magliabechiana site covers about 400 years and seems to be concentrated in two phases, namely the 7th century A.D. and the 10th century A.D. The latter phase might extend to the first half of the 11th century, given that the deposits are truncated by layers archeologically dated to the second half of the 11th century. The chronological gap between the two phases corresponds to a period in which lower ceramic density was recorded in both the Biblioteca Magliabechiana and Via de' Castellani excavations. At these sites, between the 7th and 10th-11th centuries, imported goods disappear and the quality and variety of retrieved artifacts diminish (Cantini, 2007; Lelli & Spezi, 2007; Francovich et al., 2007).

Radiocarbon dates for Dark Earth and alluvial deposits are available for two sites near the Biblioteca Magliabechiana: Via de' Castellani and Palazzo Vecchio (see Figure 3). At Via de' Castellani (six dates; excavations 2003-4; Arnoldus-Huyzendveld, 2007), the base of the sequence comprises Dark Earth deposits covered by alluvium dated to the second half of the 6th century and interpreted as belonging to the major flood of 589 A.D. Immediately overlying such flood sediments, there are Dark Earth deposits dated to the middle of the 7th century. These are buried by alluvium dated to the 12th century and interpreted to be the result of the large flood recorded in Florence on the 4th of November 1177 A.D. In the Palazzo Vecchio excavations (19 dates; Arnoldus-Huyzendveld et al., 2010), Dark Earth deposits were dated between the late 10th century and the second half of the 11th century. These deposits cover a flood layer that, based on archaeological considerations, could record the 589 A.D. flood. The Dark Earth unit is sealed by alluvium that dates to the second half of the 12th century (probably the known flood of 1177 A.D.).

# MATERIALS AND METHODS

Three profiles from the excavation area were sampled for analysis and are here referred to as profiles 1, 2, and 3 (Figures 3, 4, 5, 6; see profile description in Table II). Undisturbed oriented blocks were collected for thin section analysis in each profile with the goal of sampling the entire Dark Earth deposit and the layers immediately above and below it. Bulk samples for physicochemical analyses were collected approximately every  $5\mathrm{cm}$  from Dark Earth, together with samples of the overlying and underlying deposits. Thin sections were prepared according to the methods of Benyarku and Stoops (2005) and described using the terminology and concepts of Stoops (2003). The thin section study included area counting to quantify the occurrence of various relevant components at  $1\mathrm{-cm}$  intervals. For selected features, Scanning Elec

tron Microscopy/Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometry (SEM/EDS) analyses were performed on carbon-coated impregnated blocks and uncovered thin sections (JEOL JSM-6400, Noran Vantage microanalysis system, Noran Instruments, Inc., Middleton, Wisconsin).

Physicochemical analyses were performed for the fine earth fraction  $(< 2\mathrm{mm})$ . Descriptions of the laboratory methods and procedures can be found in Pauwels et al. (1992), except where otherwise specified, and are only briefly described here. Texture was determined without prior decalcification after destruction of organic matter with  $30\%$ $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2$ . Grain-size distribution of the sand fraction  $(>63~\mu \mathrm{m})$  was determined by dry sieving, and silt and clay, separated by wet sieving, were quantified by the pipette method. Organic carbon content was determined by the method of Walkley and Black, and nitrogen content with the Kjeldhal method. pH was measured with a

1:1 ratio in both  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  and KCl using a glass electrode pH-meter. The calcium carbonate content was determined for  $2.5\mathrm{g}$  of soil passed through a  $500 - \mu \mathrm{m}$  sieve, measuring the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  pressure generated upon reaction with HCl in a calcimeter. For determination of dithionite-extractable Fe and Mn, the dissolution of amorphous and crystalline oxides was achieved with a dithionite-citrate buffer, and Fe and Mn in the extracts was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). Cation-exchange capacity (CEC) and exchangeable basic cations were determined using an ammonium acetate solution buffered at  $\mathsf{pH}8.2$ . Total phosphate was measured following the method described by Mikkelsen (1997), involving reaction with  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{SO}_4$  and measurement by a spectro-colorimeter. Radiocarbon dates were calibrated by means of OxCal 4.1.7 software (Bronk Ramsey, 2010), using the IntCal04 calibration curve (Reimer et al., 2004; see also Fedi et al., 2007).

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

# Profile 1

Field observations for Profile 1 (Figure 4) are reported in Table II. The results of the thin section study are pre

sented in Tables III and IV, and those of physicochemical analyses in Tables V and VI.

In this profile, the 55-cm-thick Dark Earth deposit occurs on top of a unit (US 755) interpreted during excavation as material resulting from destruction by fire and the subsequent leveling of a building. In thin section, this unit contains large quantities of charcoal intimately mixed with soil material, wood-ash aggregates, and burnt soil fragments.

The basal part of the Dark Earth (lower  $10~\mathrm{cm}$ ) is marked by a slight increase in organic carbon and a much higher  $\mathrm{P}_2\mathrm{O}_5$  content than the under- and overlying intervals (Table V). This feature can be attributed to the presence of abundant fecal material, as observed in thin section. This consists of excrement fragments often containing calcareous fecal spherulites and rare phytoliths (Figure 8a; see Canti, 1997) and of yellowish, optically isotropic aggregates that are autofluorescent under blue light (Figure 8b), indicating a phosphatic nature (see Altemüller & Van Vliet-Lanoe, 1990; Karkanas & Goldberg 2010). SEM/EDS analyses on some of these aggregates revealed a calcium phosphate composition, suggesting that they most likely represent carnivore/omnivore excrements (Macphail, 2000; Macphail & Goldberg, 2010). Wood-ash aggregates are also widespread in this part of

the deposit. The association of dung of diverse origin, ash, and other domestic waste (e.g., potsherds, burned bones, charcoal, fragments of construction material) indicates that this early phase of Dark Earth formation took place in an area where manure was produced, a practice referred to as "night-soiling" (see Goldberg & Macphail, 2006; Davidson et al., 2006). Textural pedofeatures are common at the base of the Dark Earth deposit, especially in the form of layered silt-clay coatings and infillings, or as dusty clay coatings with grading (Figure 9a, 9b). These are composed of fine material that could either derive from higher parts of the profile during floods or could have been brought in by turbid floodwaters. They are therefore similar to "flood coatings," textural pedofeatures forming rapidly in soils that are flooded during part of the year, which are often banded due to successive flows (Brammer, 1971; Stoops & Eswaran, 1985). These pedofeatures are very well-preserved. They must therefore have developed after a period of intense bioturbation that appears to be essential for Dark Earth formation. Bioturbation was in fact active before flood coatings formed as demonstrated by the widespread biogenic porosity and by the occurrence of excremental features linked to soil fauna activity. Redoximorphic features such as iron oxide (see Schwertmann & Taylor, 1989) nodules and hypocoatings also suggest wet conditions. These data fit with the picture of a marginal area with rural characteristics subject to flooding by the Arno River, as inferred from geomorphological and archaeological data.

We did not observe alluvial intercalations within the Dark Earth interval, possibly because strong bioturbation has reworked occasional thin alluvial layers, homogenizing them within the Dark Earth (see Cremaschi & Nicosia, 2010).

A second phase of Dark Earth formation is recorded by the next interval, above  $40/45 \mathrm{~cm}$  from the top of the unit. During an initial stage, corresponding to the  $-40/45$  to  $-30 \mathrm{~cm}$  interval, sedimentation appears to have been rapid, outpacing bioturbation, as testified by the lower overall porosity (Table III). This could indicate a first phase of massive dumping (e.g., for ground raising). In the upper  $30 \mathrm{~cm}$  of the Dark Earth layer, bioturbation is again very strong, suggesting a slower build up of anthropogenic materials. Compared to the first phase of Dark Earth formation, this interval has a lower content of fecal material and smaller amounts of coarse charcoal and mortar. Except for some rare artisan activity waste (e.g., slag, metal fragments), sedimentation seems to be linked mainly to the dumping of waste from domestic activities (burned and unburned bones, burned sediments, eggshell fragments).

Overall, the upper  $45/40~\mathrm{cm}$  of the Dark Earth deposit in Profile 1 exhibit micromorphological characteristics that are recurrent for Dark Earth in both other studied profiles (2 and 3). The first of such characteristics is the presence of large quantities of finely fragmented charcoal and charred vegetal fragments  $(5 - 15\mu \mathrm{m})$  dispersed in the groundmass  $(20 - 30\%)$  of the field of view at

$200 \times$  magnification; Figure 9c). Larger charcoal fragments and artifacts such as bricks, potsherds, bones, mortar fragments, ash aggregates, and slag are scattered without grading or preferential orientation. Secondly, Dark Earth is characterized by very strong bioturbation indicated by the occurrence of channels (Figure 9d) and by the common, often intersecting, crescent infillings (Figure 9e; see Stoops, 2003). The crescent infillings record the action of earthworms and possibly beetles (see Jongmans, Pulleman, & Marinissen, 2001; Kooistra & Pulleman, 2010). Probable galleries of beetles or larger animals were occasionally identified in the field, in particular where they were filled with Dark Earth and occurred in the overlying and underlying layers with lighter colors. As a result of bioturbation, no microscopic sedimentary structures are observed. The limited variability of most of the physicochemical parameters with depth (organic C, N, CEC, base saturation, dithionite extractable Fe, and Mn; Tables V and VI) is in agreement with the homogeneous nature of Dark Earth as documented by other studies (see Introduction). The loamy texture is most likely the outcome of mixing of materials with different size classes brought to the site by human activities (e.g., dumping, trampling, digging; see Moinerau, 1970) and of natural reworking processes (e.g., bioturbation, weathering of earth-based construction materials).

In the upper  $10\mathrm{cm}$  of the Dark Earth deposit, the quantity of anthropogenic components decreases. This reflects a progressive diminishing of human presence before the area is definitively buried by alluvium. The change in soil hydrological regime preceding and following the alluvial episode is recorded in the Dark Earth deposit by redoximorphic features, such as iron oxide hypocoatings and coatings. The abundance of these neoformations increases toward the top. Together with rare flood coatings immediately below the alluvial layer, with iron oxide hypocoatings and quasicoatings, the observed redoximorphic features point to a moderate to strong degree of hydromorphism (see Stoops, 1983; Stoops & Eswaran, 1985; Stoops & Delvigne, 1990). The alluvial silty clay loam layer that closes the sequence is undisturbed, as is shown by fine layering.

Earth unit) has a clay-loamy texture and is strongly homogenized by bioturbation. Anthropogenic components and fine charcoal are frequent but not as abundant as in both higher intervals, where the typical Dark Earth characteristics, as described for Profile 1, are present. This interval could therefore be the outcome of the homogenization and reworking during early phases of Dark Earth formation taking place on a layer of alluvium or of dumped material of alluvial origin.

The second interval (38 to  $18\mathrm{cm}$  below the top of the unit) is marked by the presence of abundant fecal material. This consists mostly of remains of carnivore/omnivore excrements. Similar to those described for Profile 1, these aggregates are optically isotropic, autofluorescent under blue light, and confirmed to have a calcium phosphate composition by SEM/EDS analysis (see Figure 8b). Input of cess or latrine waste is testified by reworked aggregates, also yellowish and optically isotropic, containing vivianite crystal intergrowths (see

Macphail & Goldberg, 2010). Common weathered bone fragments, possibly altered during digestion (Karkanas & Goldberg, 2010), together with calcareous spherulites scattered in the groundmass, are further indicators of the input of fecal material. Common flood coatings and redoximorphic features point to a wet environment subject to periodic flooding. These conditions took place during and after the area saw the accumulation of materials to be later employed as manure, as already discussed for Profile 1.

The upper  $18~\mathrm{cm}$  of the Dark Earth deposit contains much less fecal material and has a larger amount of anthropogenic inclusions of domestic origin than the underlying interval. These anthropogenic components are mainly bone fragments (often burned), potsherds, brick fragments, and mortar aggregates, and occur in a strongly bioturbated matrix. It can therefore be stated that around Profile 2, as in the area surrounding Profile 1, a phase of dumping of domestic material followed the early phase of

manure production. Progressively wetter conditions are recorded for this portion of the Dark Earth layer by an upward increase in abundance of Fe/Mn oxide hypocoatings, coatings, and infillings, the latter often with fibrous aspect (Figure 9f). These conditions are related to the change in hydraulic regime that culminated with the deposition of the alluvial layer that sealed the sequence. The progressive abandonment of the area, possibly as the environment became wetter, is shown by the decrease of anthropogenic components in the upper  $10\mathrm{cm}$  of the Dark Earth layer. This upper interval seems to be a weakly decalcified topsoil, developed in anthropogenic parent material, based on its weakly separated subangular blocky microstructure (as opposed to the apedal structure in lower parts of the profile) and by indications of slight decalcification. The latter include weathering of mortar fragments, which are unusually porous, partly optically isotropic and often highly fragmented along the sides, a feature suggesting that some of the coarse mineral grains they originally contained were released and incorporated

into the groundmass (see Macphail 1994). Decarbonation is also recorded by a slight decrease in  $\mathrm{CaCO}_3$  ( $2.1\%$  vs.  $2.9 - 3.0\%$ ) and base saturation ( $76\%$  vs.  $87\%$ ). The alluvial layer that covers the Dark Earth has a silty clay loam texture, contains rare diatoms, and is undisturbed.

# Profile 3

Field observations for Profile 3 (Figure 6) are reported in Table II. The results of the thin section study are presented in Tables III and IV, and those of physicochemical analyses in Tables V and VI.

In this profile, Dark Earth rests on top of a strongly bioturbated unit with a sandy clay loam texture and with few anthropogenic components. Similarly to Profile 2, this could be interpreted as a layer of alluvium or backfill homogenized by bioturbation and human activity associated with later Dark Earth development. This transitional unit lies directly on the remains of a brick wall, whereas the top of the Dark Earth deposit is truncated by

later archaeological structures. The typical micromorphological characteristics of Dark Earth (strong bioturbation, fine charcoal/charred matter, frequent artifacts) become clearly visible only in the uppermost  $5\mathrm{cm}$ , just below the truncation plain. As in Profiles 1 and 2, fecal material is common, mostly in the form of carnivore/omnivore excrement fragments and weathered bone. Secondary phosphates formed in situ are present throughout the entire profile. These occur as orange/yellow coatings and dense complete infillings, mostly with a fibrous aspect and occasionally showing the typical blue colors and pleochroism of vivianite (Figure 8c). SEM/EDS analyses revealed that these neoformations consist predominantly of calcium-iron phosphates or calcium phosphates with associated iron oxides (Figure 8d). Pedofeatures with similar morphology and composition have been interpreted as the result of postburial stages of vivianite formation and degradation by Gebhardt and Langohr (1999). The occurrence of these secondary phosphates, not observed in the other profiles studied here, is most likely related to the presence of a brick wall or of other associated structures (e.g., floors) at the base of the sequence, acting as an

impermeable barrier favoring water-logging and hence the development of reducing conditions. The occurrence of flood coatings again points to periodic flooding of the area after the early phases of Dark Earth formation. These phases were characterized by the accumulation of a mixture of fecal material and domestic residues, possibly for the production of organic manure, as already mentioned in discussion of Profiles 1 and 2.

# CONCLUSIONS

# Dark Earth Genesis

The analyses performed in this study allowed us to ascertain that various anthropogenic activities and natural processes are involved in the genesis of Dark Earth at the Biblioteca Magliabechiana site. The main type of human activity was the repeated dumping of waste material, confirming the cumulic character of Dark Earth postulated by various authors (e.g., Macphail 1981; Cammas, Courty, & Fedoroff, 1998; Cammas, 2004). Dumping can be performed in order to accumulate and store certain

materials produced by various human activities for a later use. This is the case, for example, for the accumulation of household waste, ash, and fecal material in order to produce manure or night-soil for horticulture. The early stages of Dark Earth formation at the Biblioteca Magliabechiana are related to this type of activity, thus revealing practices of "waste management" at the margins of the early medieval city (see Cammas Courty, & Fedoroff, 1998; Davidson et al., 2006). As in this phase we did not

identify macroscopic nor microscopic traces of in situ cultivation, it can be hypothesized that the area was used for a form of middening, the resulting manure being used elsewhere.

During a second phase, recorded in both Profiles 1 and 2, dumping appears to have been performed simply to get rid of domestic waste (e.g., by discarding them in courtyards), or in order to raise the ground level (e.g., for protection against floods).

Progressive dumping of archaeological sediments led to the accumulation of anthropogenic material upon which natural syn- and post-depositional processes could act. These processes are mainly bioturbation and weathering. The latter is only marginally attested in the studied sequence, in the form of weathering of mortar fragments in the upper part of Profile 2. Bioturbation, more specifically burrowing by soil fauna (e.g., earthworms, beetles, small mammals), is the dominant process and is very strongly expressed in all examined profiles. The main outcome of the burrowing action of soil fauna is the strong homogenization of the parent material. This results in the disappearance of any original sedimentary structure, both at the field scale as well as in thin section, and is highlighted by the limited variation of most physicochemical parameters with depth in all examined profiles. Bioturbation appears to be extremely efficient in reworking and dislocating small fabric elements. In contrast, larger components such as bones, bricks, mortar, and stones are less affected by vertical redistribution by burrowing soil fauna. These coarse components are not uniformly scattered in the studied profiles, indicating preservation of vertical distribution patterns that record changes in the nature of anthropogenic activities over time (e.g., night-soiling, domestic waste dumping, progressive abandonment). Another important effect of bioturbation is the fragmentation of charcoal and charred vegetal matter and the redistribution of finely comminuted material of this type. In thin section, passage features often cross larger charcoal fragments or charred pieces, fragmenting and reworking them. The resulting passage features (e.g., zones with a crescent fabric) always contain large amounts of dark microparticles. Even in lack of direct evidence for this, it can be assumed that part of the charcoal and charred vegetal fragments in the groundmass could have been already comminuted at the origin. This may be the case, for example, for burned matter within dumped hearth wastes (as confirmed by experimental studies—see Miller et al., 2010), or when it consists of airborne material such as soot (Courty, Goldberg, & Macphail, 1989). Finer charcoal particles were also redistributed within the soil by mobilization and redeposition of groundmass material (see Clark, 1988) or transported by floodwaters.

Alluvial sediments that were deposited before and during formation of Dark Earth were also reworked and homogenized by bioturbation. We can only hypothesize that alluvial inputs contemporaneous to Dark Earth formation (indicated by "flood coatings") were incorporated within the aggrading sequence. Nevertheless, in Profiles 2 and 3, the alluvial materials below the Dark Earth deposits, whether in place or dumped by humans, became strongly homogenized due to bioturbation associated with its for

formation, resulting in an interval whose nature is difficult to discern in the field.

# Implications for Archaeology

The primary archaeological implication of the present study is that the formation of Dark Earth in this marginal area of Florence is not related to abandonment. On the contrary, anthropogenic sedimentation was very active, albeit with other characteristics than during earlier periods, when Dark Earth did not form. This change in the style of sedimentation mainly records a change in the mode of use of urban space, possibly as a form of adaptation to a context that saw periodic flooding of the Arno River, at least since the 4th century A.D. The new modes of dwelling were linked to a markedly rural context, characterized by insubstantial buildings made from perishable materials and by frequent robbing and reuse of construction materials, as highlighted by archaeological excavations.

The early phase of Dark Earth formation, radiocarbon dated to the 7th century A.D., relates to the accumulation of manure or "night-soil". This practice fits well with an area linked to urban agricultural or horticultural practices (see Davidson et al., 2006), hence with a more rural character than in the following dwelling phase (10th to early 11th century A.D.—see next). The environment appears to be characterized by wet conditions during the early phase of Dark Earth formation. The common flood coatings in this part of the sequence indicate that periodic inundations took place, which is also confirmed by geomorphological and archaeological data. As already mentioned, alluvial sediments were most likely reworked by bioturbation within the Dark Earth deposit. Human activities, such as digging, trampling, backfilling, and ground leveling, also contributed to their reworking. After the phase of human activity of the 7th century, a point was probably reached when the environment became unfavorably wet (e.g., high water table, recurrent high stages). This ultimately led to a period of nondeposition and abandonment, marked also by the lower ceramic density recorded during excavations. Such a period is also highlighted by the gap of c. 250 years between the base and the top part of the Dark Earth interval, inferred from the available radiocarbon dates (see Table I; Figure 7).

The resumption of Dark Earth formation in the 10th to early 11th century A.D. is marked by possible ground-raising episodes (fast accretion outpacing biological reworking, observed only for Profile 1) and to the more gradual build-up of domestic waste. These activities indicate that the area was again inhabited, and that the conditions were favorable for strong biological activity

to resume. Archaeological excavations exposed postholes and scatters of construction rubble that could be linked to buildings built with perishable materials that date to the 11th century. Toward the end of the second period of Dark Earth formation, the environment shows another transition toward wetter conditions in a context characterized by the gradual decrease in human presence. The wet conditions culminated in the deposition of the alluvial layers that cover the sequence, most likely corresponding to the major flood of 1177 A.D.

The archaeopedological study of the Biblioteca Magliabechiana Dark Earth, integrated with geomorphological, chronological, and archaeological data, has proved useful for both cultural-historical and palaeoenvironmental reconstructions. It has allowed for the reconstruction of the palimpsest of anthropogenic activities involved in Dark Earth genesis, and also made it possible to decipher the environmental conditions during Dark Earth formation, linked to an active alluvial environment.
