# ABSTRACT

This paper underscores the importance of investigating soils and sediments in proto-urban to urban archaeological contexts to gain a comprehensive understanding of their genesis and evolution, and their informative role in deciphering historical human-environment interactions and spatial organisation patterns. We focus on Early to High Mediaeval (6th–14th century CE) anthropogenically modified soils and sediments from Uherske Hradiste (Czech Republic). A study of well-preserved Dark Earths (DEs) uncovered in the Morava River floodplain allowed us to define interactions between people and their environment and to understand landscape evolution of the island area in relation to floodplain dynamics. A multi-proxy approach based on a combination of archaeological evidence, soil micromorphology, and physical, geochemical and palaeobotanical analyses, supplemented with dating methods was used to unravel the processes contributing to DE formation, human activities and the use of space. Initial settlement activities began in Uherske Hradiste at the end of the 7th or beginning of the 8th century CE, with later DEs indicating intensified human impact through craft activities, probably linked to market exchange from the 8th century, and even a possible marketplace underscoring its strategic importance within the broader economic and social networks, partially before and mainly during the Great Moravian period, in the 9th century CE. After a hiatus in the 10th–12th centuries AD, the site saw re-establishment in the 13th century CE, marking the early formation of the urbanisation in Uherske Hradiste. Despite repeated flooding, the settlement in the area was renewed repeatedly. Together with evidence of long-distance trade, this proves the importance of the place located on the commercial waterway of the Morava River. New findings reveal that this settlement could have played a more essential role in the Early Mediaeval era than previously expected.

# 1. Introduction

Dynamic fluvial networks and seasonal floods played crucial roles in shaping the landscape of the floodplain regions of mediaeval Europe. It was here that natural processes intersected with the long-term continuity of settlement and trade, significantly influencing the development of proto-urban and urban landscapes. This often led to repeated accumulation of cultural deposits, particularly in areas with concentrated commercial or craftwork activities (e.g. Devos et al., 2013a; Wouters et al., 2019). These areas therefore often exhibit a complex stratigraphy comprising alluvial and occupation deposits, the latter reflecting extensive human activities (e.g. Tys and Wouters, 2016; Khamnueva-Wendt et al., 2020). Such activities can lead to modifications and enrichment of soils and sediments (e.g. Cook and Heizer, 1965; Holliday, 2004) resulting in the formation of anthropogenically altered soils, known as Anthrosols or Technosols (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2022).

Such profoundly human-modified soils have already started forming in Europe several centuries ago in intensely inhabited proto-urban or urban environments. Particular attention has been paid to the so-called Dark Earths (DEs). They are characterised as relatively thick, dark, humic, no or weakly stratified and particularly homogenous horizons often containing anthropogenic materials such as fragments of pottery, bones, charcoals, plaster, bricks etc. that developed as a result of the interplay between human activity and natural syn- and postdepositional events (Nicosia et al., 2017). Therefore, their examination can reveal past environmental/palaeoecological changes, human activities and settlement patterns (e.g. Macphail et al., 1983; 2010; Nicosia et al., 2014; Nicosia et al., 2017; Borderie et al., 2015; Devos, 2019; Devos et al., 2022). The term Dark Earths has been used for the last decades as a descriptive rather than interpretative term as it has been demonstrated that every DE needs to be examined separately to fully understand its significant differences, considering the unique archaeological and societal circumstances (e.g. Macphail et al., 1994; Devos, 2019; Devos et al., 2022). Over the last decades DEs have been studied in urban archaeological contexts mainly in western, northwestern, southwestern Europe and western Central Europe, where research has been ongoing for several decades and is constantly progressing (e.g. Macphail et al., 1994; Cammas et al., 2004 Borderie, 2011; Nicosia et al., 2012; Devos et al., 2013b; Wouters et al., 2017; Wouters et al., 2019; Bortolini et al., 2022; Grau-Sologestoa et al., 2023; Bortolini et al., 2024), while in eastern Central Europe research is limited to a few case studies (Krupski et al., 2017; Asare et al., 2020), none of them situated in alluvial settings.

The proto-urban development of Uherske Hradiste (Czech Republic, Central Europe) in Early Mediaeval Ages and the site's transformation into an urban space in the 13th century CE (Mitáček and Procházka, 2007) are still poorly understood because the remnants of the Great Moravian settlement and older occupation phases are deeply buried beneath urban constructions, accessible only in specific areas during new constructions, reconstructions, and linear trenches for engineering networks (e.g. Procházka and Snásil, 1983; Snásil and Procházka, 1984; Snásil and Novotné, 1985; Procházka, 1999; Menoušková, 2008). Furthermore, some of the findings were irretrievably lost in a 20th-century flood that affected the depository of Uherske Hradiste (Frolíková-Kaliszová, 2020). A recent archaeological excavation of the cellar of one of the modern buildings in the actual town centre revealing a sequence of floodplain sediments and DEs offers a unique opportunity to fill in some of the missing pieces.

We aim to: 1) understand how DEs at Uherské Hradisté were formed, focusing on the interplay between soil formation, floodplain environment evolution, and settlement activities, 2) reconstruct the ancient Mediaeval environment and changes over time based on palynological and archaeobotanical evidence, and 3) interpret archaeological findings from recent excavations and integrate it with the genesis of the DE to understand past human activities and settlement patterns from the proto-urban to urban development of Uherské Hradisté and discuss it in

a wider context.

# 2. Regional settings

# 2.1. Site description

Uherske Hradiste (49.0703886 N, 17.4599381E, Czech Republic) is located approximately  $80~\mathrm{km}$  to the southeast of the city of Brno, Moravia region, in the floodplain of the Morava River, which is a part of the geomorphological formation of the Lower Morava Valley that belongs to the northernmost part of the Vienna Basin (Fig. 1A). The Morava River flows here between the Chriby highlands in the west and the Vizovice Hills in the east. During the late Pleistocene, it formed a system of islands on the river sands, which were covered by overbank fluvial sediments in the Holocene (e.g. Procházka and Havlíček, 1996). The town Uherske Hradiste was built on the island of St. George (Fig. 2A) which was originally interwoven with channels that were modified by man since the Middle Ages (Procházka and Sulitková, 1984). The island is composed of various types of fluvial sediments and anthropogenic deposits. Quaternary sediments such as colluvium and loess deposits are also found in the surrounding area of the island (Fig. 1B). The floodplain is surrounded by low hills of the Carpathian Flysch Belt formed mainly by sandstone and claystone from the Magura Nappe-group. Except for the Anthrosols occurring on the studied site and in the wider area of the town itself, Fluvisols, Gleysols and Greyic Phaeozems developed in the floodplain. Recent soils in the surrounding upland include Chernozems, Luvisols and Cambisols (Fig. 1C). The current average annual air temperature is in the range of  $8^{\circ}\mathrm{C} - 9^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , and the total average annual precipitation is in the range of  $450 - 550\mathrm{mm}$  (Tolasz, 2007). The studied sedimentary sequences were discovered during an archaeological rescue excavation in 2017 (Bartík and Chrástek, 2018; Petřík et al., 2018) in the northeastern corner of Mariánské Square in the cellar of house No. 125 (Fig. 2B, 2C). The altitude of the current surface reaches  $181\mathrm{m}$  a.s.l. The youngest part of the preserved record was captured  $270 - 280\mathrm{cm}$  deep below rubble and recent building foundations.

# 2.2. Archaeological and historical context of Uherske Hradiste

The island of St. George, on which the stone fortifications of the newly established city Uherské Hradisté were erected in the 13th century CE, lay on an ancient trade route (the Amber Road's eastern branch) connecting southern Europe to the Baltic Sea, and there was also an essential ford across the Morava River (Hrubý, 1957; Snášil, 1971). During the Early Mediaeval Ages, the island of St. George, together with the nearby Stare Město city (Fig. 2A), was a part of a large residential agglomeration (Galuska, 1999; Galuska and Kouril, 2014). It was one of several documented (sub)urban agglomerations with a central function (Galuska and Poláček, 2006). During the 9th century CE, the aforementioned agglomerations served as the administrative, cultural and economic centres of the pre-state entity known as 'Great Moravia' (Mérínský, 2006). The exact function of the island of St. George within the said agglomeration has not yet been resolved. However, the occurrence of prestigious artefacts that confirm the presence of the social elite and the abundant remains of the stone mortar buildings indicate the central function of the island. Although the remains of an Early Mediaeval settlement have been identified in almost two dozen locations (cf. Procházka and Havlíček, 1996; Frolíková-Kaliszová, 2020; Menoušková, 2020), we still have only fragmentary information on the settlement structure. We can get a certain idea of the character of the development based on o housing estates investigated in the nearby Stare Město city (Hrubý, 1965) or in Uhershé Hradisté-Sady (Maresová, 1985) (Fig. 2A). Typical residential buildings in the form of partially sunken dugouts or log cabins with heating equipment in the corner were documented on these settlements, which complemented other economic (storage pits, barns, haylofts and furnaces) and production facilities (forge, specialised workshop, etc.). The specifics of the island of St. George are findings

However, the existence of two sacred buildings is also assumed (Kohoutek and Procházka, 1993; 1997; Dresler and Vágner, 2013).

were examined in three sections (P1-P3) in rooms 3, 4a and 4b (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). A basic macroscopic soil and sedimentary description was performed in the field following guidelines for soil profile description (Curlík and Šurina 1998; FAO, 2006).

# 3.2. Soil micromorphology and  $\mu$ XRF mapping of thin sections

Nine undisturbed samples (five from P1, three from P2 and one from P3) were collected in Kubiëna tins. Preparation of thin sections followed standard laboratory procedures (Murphy, 1986). The thin sections were analysed under a polarising microscope in transmitted polarised light (PPL) and under crossed polarised light (XPL) at a magnification of ca.

$40 - 400\times$ , following standard guidelines (Bullock et al., 1985; Stoops, 2021). The thin sections were also scanned on an EPSON Scan at 3200 ppi resolution in PPL.

The elemental composition of the nine thin section surfaces was mapped using the micro X-ray fluorescence (μXRF) spectrometer Atlas X 8010 (IXRF, USA) equipped with a  $50\mathrm{w}$ $(50\mathrm{kV},1\mathrm{mA})$  X-ray tube with an Rh anode, polycapillary focusing optics with top-down perpendicular geometry and semiconductor silicon drift detector with resolution  $\leq 130\mathrm{eV}$ . The X-ray tube was operated at a voltage of  $20\mathrm{kV}$  and current of  $500\mathrm{A}$ . Samples were analyzed in a vacuum with a spatial resolution of  $50~{\mu\mathrm{m}}$  and an integration time of  $100~\mathrm{mS}$ . Data were processed using Iridium Ultra software.

# 3.3. Physico-chemical analyses

The particle size distribution of individual stratigraphical units (SU) in P1 and P2 was determined using a Bettersizer S3 Plus instrument combining laser and optical granulometry. A total of 18 samples were chemically pre-treated by dispersing them in distilled water with sodium hexametaphosphate to prevent particle flocculation. The limits of basic size fraction categories are following: clay (up to  $3.9\mu \mathrm{m}$ ), silt (3.9-63

$\mu \mathrm{m})$  and sand (63–2000  $\mu \mathrm{m}$ ) according to Wentworth (1922). Similarity-indices (Comparative Particle Size Distribution index matrices, hereafter: S.I.) were calculated following Langohr et al. (1976). Mass-specific magnetic susceptibility  $(\chi)$  was measured on 64 samples from P1 and P2 using an Agico Kappabridge MFK1-FA device set at a frequency of 976 Hz operating with a magnetic field amplitude of  $200\mathrm{A / m}$ . Data were normalised using the mass of each sample on mass-specific magnetic susceptibility  $(\chi \mathrm{mass})$  using the following equation:  $\chi \mathrm{f}1 / \mathrm{mass}\times 100$  (expressed in  $\mathrm{m}^3\mathrm{kg}^{-1}$ ). The chemical composition was determined on the same samples using a Rigaku NexCG energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometer with a 50-W Pd tube with an SSD detector of 145-eV resolution (for detail see Adamekova and Petrik, 2022).

# 3.4. Dating methods

The OSL dating of three samples was performed at the Scientific-Didactic Laboratory Centre of the Institute of Geography of Jan Kochanowski University in Kielce, Poland. For the purpose of uranium, thorium and potassium concentration value measurement, a Natural Radionuclide Analyser 'Mazar-01' was used. Cosmic radiation influence was considered while calculating the annual dose rate (in Gy/Ka).

Samples were treated with  $10\%$  HCl,  $40\%$  HF and  $\mathrm{H2O2}$  to remove carbonates and organic materials. They were then sieved to  $63 - 210~{\mu\mathrm{m}}$ . Density separation was performed using SPT diluted to standard densities to isolate heavy mineral  $(>2.70\mathrm{gcm} - 3)$  and quartz mineral grains  $(2.70 - 2.62\mathrm{gcm} - 3)$ . The OSL measurement was conducted using a Manual Reader-Analyser TL/OSL RA'04. A part of the fraction of each sample was irradiated with doses of 100, 200 and 300 (Gy/Ka). Quartz portions  $(0.5\mathrm{mg})$  were stimulated with  $470\mathrm{-nm}$  blue light and an equivalent dose (ED) was calculated using the regeneration method (Murray and Wintle, 2000). The OSL age was calculated dividing the ED by the annual dose rate with measurement error of  $\pm 15\%$ . Radiocarbon dating of four charcoal fragments and two charred cereal grains was performed at the Department of Earth System Science of the University of California, Irvine (lab. code UCIAMS). Samples were pre-treated according to standard protocols using HCl and HCl-NaOH-HCl (Santos et al., 2007). All results were corrected for isotopic fractionation according to the conventions reported by Stuiver and Polach (1977), with d13C values measured on prepared graphite using an AMS spectrometer.

Five stakes were processed in the Laboratory of Dendrochronology of the Department of Wood Science of Mendel University in Brno according to a standard dendrochronological methodology (Cook and Kairiukstis, 1990; Rybnicek, 2004). The tree-ring sequences of the samples were measured. An average tree-ring curve was created from the tree-ring curves, which were dated according to the Moravian oak standard chronology (Prokop et al., 2017).

The proposed chronostratigraphic model developed using Bayesian modelling, is based on 14C, OSL, dendrochronological ages, and a coin. The Bayesian model was constructed in OxCal 4.4. The 14C ages were calibrated using the IntCal20 calibration curve (Reimer et al., 2020) and expressed in thousands of calendar years before the present (cal BP). Individual dates were grouped into phases, for which an OxCal outlier analysis was performed (Bronk Ramsey, 2009). For each phase, a summarised age (mean and standard deviation) (Bronk Ramsey, 2017) was calculated. The modelled values (68.3 % probabilities) of 'boundary start from' and 'boundary end to' were rounded to the nearest dozen to express the time range of the individual phases/units.

# 3.5. Palaeobotanical analysis

Pollen samples were processed using the standard method of aceto-lysis using hydrofluoric acid (Moore et al., 1991). Approximately  $1\mathrm{cm}^3$  of sediment per sample was used to obtain pollen extracts, identified using palynological atlases (Beug, 2004; Moore et al., 1991). The pollen diagram was created using the POLPAL program (Nalepka and Walanusz, 2003). Each sample contained at least 300 pollen grains, with Alnus and Cyperaceae excluded from the terrestrial pollen sum. Pollen was preserved only at the base of P1  $(426 - 386~\mathrm{cm}$  depth), while other samples contained only microcharcoal and isolated pollen grains.

Charcoals and macro-remains were obtained by water flotation (volume of ca. 5 l of each sample), followed by wet sieving using a  $200\mu \mathrm{m}$  diameter mesh (Jacomet and Kreuz, 1999). Charcoal analysis was performed only on fragments larger than  $2\mathrm{mm}$ , which were identified using an episcopic microscope with  $50 - 200\times$  magnification and a reference collection (Schweingruber, 1990). The macro-remains were dried, examined under an Olympus dissecting microscope (magnifications of  $12\times$  and greater) and identified according to standard literature (Cappers et al., 2012) and a reference collection.

# 4. Results

Field descriptions can be found in Table 1. Micromorphological data are summarized in Table 2. The  $\mu$ XRF-images (Fig. 5) show that the visible charcoal particles in SU 8 are typically enriched with P and Ca, while the soil matrix appears to be rather poor in P. Although some charcoal particles also show this relation in SUs 6 and 5, the link is less systematic. For SU 4, however, P together with Ca is also present within

the soil matrix. All three SUs contain indicates the simultaneous presence of Fe and S, which likely suggests the formation of iron sulfates. SU 2, finally shows the combined presence of Fe and S, probably indicating iron-sulphates. Physico-chemical results are presented in Fig. 6, Table 3 and Supplementary material (SM) 1. In general, silt fraction prevails in both profiles. SI (Fig. 7) show very high (above  $90\%$  ) and high (above  $85\%$  ) probabilities in P1, while in P2, mostly low values (below  $85\%$  ) are present. Table 4, Fig. 8. And SM 2 report dating results. The palaeoecological data can be found in Fig. 6 and the SM 3. The data is also available on the Zenodo platform (Adamekova et al., 2025).

The studied sediments consist of fluvial and alluvial deposits alternating with the sequence of DEs and floors, dating from approximately the 6th to 14th centuries AD. Stratigraphic differences between the profiles are due to their distinct geomorphological settings. P1 is located in the depression of an ancient water channel, while P2 is on the bank of this channel documented along most of the northern edge of the excavated area. P3 documents more or less the central (highest) part of the area (Fig. 3A). Importantly, some SU can be correlated, which allows us to create a comprehensive and general picture of the site development from the proto-urban environment to the emergence of the mediaeval city of Uherské Hradiste.

# 5. Discussion

# 5.1. Taphonomy

Whereas for most part of the sequence bioturbation is limited, this is not the case for the DE's. Within them ubiquitous signs of homogenisation of the sedimentary matrix can be observed, including channels, passage features and biospheroids.

Generally, in the lower part of the studied profiles, we observed secondary formed ferrous iron phosphate minerals (vivianites) and iron sulphide minerals (pyrites) (Table 2), indicating prevailing reducing conditions (Huisman et al., 2009; Karkanas et al., 2010), hence suggesting an excellent preservation of organic remains. Few ferruginous pedofeatures (mainly orthic Fe nodules) were present in the upper part, indicating short episodes of water saturation or a rapid fluctuation of the water table (Rabenhorst et al., 1998; Karkanas et al., 2010; Lindbo et al., 2010). Their presence suggests a poorer organic preservation for these units (see further).

# 5.2. Reconstruction of depository history: Holocene fluvial and alluvial deposits

The bottom part of the studied area is formed by sand (SU 10) of unknown origin and age. These deposits were covered by overbank deposits (SU 9) formed by aggradation of the Morava River lasting until the Early Mediaeval Ages (transition of the 6th and 7th centuries AD) as it was proved by dating of a charcoal layer (Table 4, Fig. 8). Except for the charcoal layer reflecting one of the first human activities on the island of St. George, the sediments bring no evidence of direct anthropogenic activity. Similarly, the pollen record (Fig. 6B) indicates a forested alluvium only weakly impacted by humans as shown by the limited amount of indicators of human presence such as cereals and ruderal species e.g. Artemisia or Chenopodiaceae. Woodland compositions are dominated by Quercus, Pinus, Picea, Abies and less common are other trees such as Betula, Fagus, Corylus and Carpinus. Previous observations performed on sections situated ca.  $150\mathrm{m}$  from the present study area also showed the presence of forested alluvium, albeit with a higher abundance of wetland willow (Salix) and alder (Alnus) (see Svitavská-Svobodova, 2011). While the possibility of long-distance transport of pollen or charcoal in alluvial sediments should be considered (Hall and Huntley, 2007), many of the identified species are likely representative of the nearby vegetation (Opravil, 1984; 1985; 1999).

Such an extensive (thickness of ca.  $150~\mathrm{cm}$ ) aggradation of overbank deposits, dated before 540 CE, has not yet been identified in the

catchment of the Morava River (cf. Kadlec et al., 2009; Kadlec et al., 2022). In fact, the earliest phase of aggradation of the Morava River was documented after 700 CE and situated approximately  $20\mathrm{km}$  south of the studied location, in the area of Strážnice (Grygar et al., 2011).

no permanent standing water in the channel, as intensive bioturbation was observed. Evidence fort the bioturbation includes bow-like passage features (Fig. 5A), channel walls coated with fine organic-rich soil material (Fig. 10a) and humus enrichment (Kooistra et al., 2010). This DE thus therefore corresponds to an incipient organo-mineral surface A horizon (e.g. Gerasimova et al., 2018) representing the oldest known soil formation on the island. Although this DE contains the least anthropogenic material compared to other studied DEs at the site (Fig. 9); it includes materials of various origins, such as domestic waste (burned and unburned bone fragments, Fig. 10b), earthen-based construction material and fragments of slag (Fig. 10c), the latter probably associated with craftworking in the vicinity. At least part of these components may have entered the soil through poaching (Fig. 10d), as evidenced by convolution (Rentzel et al., 2017) of the boundary between the overbank deposits and the DE (Fig. 3B). The relatively low P content (SM 1) could reflect the relatively low intensity of human activities compared to the overlying SU, as high P concentrations are often considered an indicator of ancient human activities (e.g., Devos, 2018 and references therein).

At the same time, the basal DE (SU 8, P2), formed on overbank deposits (SU 9) with high anthropogenic input (peaks of P and Ca), developed on the riverbank in the northwest corner. It was later buried by another DE (SU 7), likely a homogeneous dump of domestic waste including up to  $60\%$  charred material, ceramics, ashes, bones, and shell fragments (Fig. 10e, f). Relatively high P and Ca values in P2 (Fig. 6A, SM 1) could be linked with decomposing bones and ashes. This dump was possibly to raise the terrain to protect it against flooding (cf. Nicosia et al., 2012). In the central area (P3), a thick DE (SU 4) formed on the overbank deposits, but due to the lack of dating, its correlation with

lower DEs in P1 and P2 remains hypothetical (Fig. 6A).

The period of soil formation in the channel was followed by a reactivation of the channel at the beginning of the 8th century CE (Fig. 8) during which a thick layer of silty loam (SU 7) was deposited (Fig. 3B). Neither can be ruled out, intentional or natural re-activation. As no alluvial sediments were observed elsewhere, the water probably did not spill out of the channel.

This is followed by the formation of another DE (SU 6) dated to the 8th century CE (Fig. 8). It developed from fluvial deposits mixed with anthropogenic components (Fig. 5B). Sediments comes probably from another re-activation that deposited very similar material to those of SU 5 (Fig. 7). The DE represents the formation of another ancient A horizon (Gerasimova et al., 2018) in the ancient channel, which means that water was not present for a certain period. Intensive bioturbation and the relatively elevated decomposed organic matter (humus) content indicates a higher degree of maturity and longer or more intense development of the DE compared with the underlying DE (SU 8). Again, at least a part of the anthropogenic components probably entered also through poaching (Rentzel et al., 2017). In this respect we can also refer to the presence of dusty clay coatings possibly related to disturbed surfaces (Courty et al., 1989; Macphail et al., 1990). The increasing abundance of randomly distributed anthropogenic components also indicates a stronger degree of anthropisation which is also reflected by increased P and Ca contents (e.g. Holliday and Gartner, 2007; Cook et al., 2014) (Fig. 6A). The combined presence of charcoal and ashes (Fig. 10g), charred black material, burned and unburned bones and shell fragments points to household waste (Devos et al., 2009; 2022). The observed vitrified ash indicates high temperature heating and together

with the, albeit rare, fragments of slag it reveals the presence of metallurgical/artisanal waste. Besides, excremental waste (Fig. 10h) including parasite eggs of Ascaris and Trichuris and construction waste (earthen based construction material) have also been observed. According to macroscopic characteristics and stratigraphic position, the SU 6 on the riverbank (P2) can be correlated with SU 6 and/or SU 5 formed in the channel (P1) and therefore probably also represent ancient surface horizon or its remains.

The following DE (SU 5) observed in the channel and dated between 760 and 820 CE (Fig. 8, SM 2) was also interpreted as a surface organomineral A horizon that was disturbed by walking. It is evidenced by signs of bioturbation as well as convolution (Fig. 10i) and fragmented charcoal (Rentzel et al., 2017; Karkanas et al., 2010). The formation is very similar to the previous DE (SU 6) in the ancient channel and the fluvial parent material was probably deposited during re-activation of the channel. The quantity of anthropogenic components, such as excreational waste, kitchen waste (Fig. 10j), metallurgical waste (Fig. 10k)

and construction material increase (Fig. 9) as well as the P and Ca contents (Fig. 6A). This DE contains a visibly larger amount of charred black material (Fig. 10l).

Above this DE, we observed a thick layer of silty loam (SU 4) that could indicate a short-term recovery of water activity in the channel, which must according to field observations already have been very shallow at the edge of 8th and 9th century CE. In other parts of the site (P2 and P3), we also observed sediment of alluvial origin, which, according to dating and stratigraphy, could be deposited at approximately the same time: overbank deposits (SU 5) in P2 containing anthropogenic materials (Fig. 11a) and overbank deposits (SU 3) in P3.

The preserved pollen record (Fig. 6B) from the 8th century CE (SU 8-6) is valuable because we have relatively little information about this period. Natural profiles outside the Early Medieval agglomeration show extensive human impact on the floodplain of the Morava River (Placek and Dejmal, 2015). Our data reveal a deforested local environment characterized by abundant grasses and ruderal species. High

percentages of Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae suggest nutrient- and nitrogen-rich conditions, while the presence of pollen from Urtica and Bryonia alba indicates the existence of wet, nutrient-rich habitats. Macro-remains (SM 3) of perennial herbaceous ruderal vegetation and scrub were also recorded (Rubus caesius, Sambucus ebulus, Sambucus nigra). Local wetland vegetation is composed of tall sedge species, with pollen from Sparganium and Filipendula. This environment appears to have experienced intensive trampling, as evidenced by pollen from Plantago major and Polygonum aviculare. Furthermore, the pollen of Mercurialis annua and macro-remains of Potentilla cf. supina, Chenopodium album, Chenopodium hybridum, Chenopodium polyspermum, and Stachys annua highlight disturbed soil.

The presence of cereal pollen and macro-remains of Triticum aestivum and Panicum miliaceum suggests agricultural activities and the cultivation of crops (cf. Kocár and Dreslerova, 2010). However, macro-remains of field weeds were documented only through individual finds of dispores from common species (Galium aparine, Vicia tetrasperma) and traces of cultivation were not detected in the DEs, suggesting that crop

cultivation happened in the surroundings of the site, rather than on the site itself. A similar environment with a high abundance of anthropogenic indicators and a low percentage of cereals was recorded at the Pohansko site (Doláková et al., 2010), located approximately  $55\mathrm{km}$  to the south, which later, as Uherské Hradišet, became an important Great Moravian centre (Macháček, 2010). The same picture of a deforested Early Mediaeval landscape with local ruderal vegetation and agricultural activities in pollen record was documented ca.  $150\mathrm{m}$  from the studied sections (Svobodová, 1990; Svitavská-Svobodov, 2011). Moreover, Svitavská-Svobodová (2011) identified spores of Sporormiella, fungi that grow on cattle excrements, and pollen which indicates the presence of a water body nearby.

Quercus has been dominant in charcoal composition since the 8th century CE (SM 3). Other broadleaf trees, such as Carpinus, Fraxinus, and Corylus, are common components of the charcoal assemblages from this period. The presence of Fagus charcoal indicates its local occurrence in alluvial forests. However, it may also be interpreted as fuelwood transported from forested uplands. Similarly, Alnus corresponds to the

deforested alluvium identified in the pollen record. Cornus, an indicator of open, sunny shrub formations, is present in both the pollen and charcoal records. A similar charcoal composition was observed in Olomouc during the Early Mediaeval period, prior to the establishment of Great Moravia (Kocár et al., 2016).

# 5.3.2. Early Mediaeval Ages: Middle Hillfort period (9th and early 10th century CE)

The next development started in the channel with a DE (SU 3) formation dated between 820 and 880 CE (Fig. 8), which according to its composition, corresponds to intentional backfilling (levelling and/or dump) of the channel with waste material and building rubble mixed with silty/loamy sediments. The channel got out of function and became an open space with several generations of soil development. The backfilling was further homogenised by bioturbation reflected also in an increased MS signal (Fig. 6A). Although the Ca and P contents values are lower (SM 1), possibly related to phosphorus translocation as a result of changes in redox status (Devos et al., 2011), a strong degree of anthropisation compared with underlying DE is shown by the diversity and richness in randomly distributed anthropogenic remains. Construction/destruction debris included mortar (Fig. 11b), daub (Fig. 11c), earthen-based materials (Fig. 11d) and possibly wood (Friesem et al., 2017; Stoops et al., 2017; Macphail and Devos, 2023). Mortar fragments appear as a new building material that was used for the first time at the site probably for plastering stones, later occurring only sporadically in the upper-lying DE.

Following DE (SU 2) in P1 developed after 850 CE on flat terrain and represents another ancient organo-mineral A horizon. This interpretation based upon the presence of humus, several generations of bioturbation, an intensively developed microstructure, the presence of calcite biospheroids (Canti, 2003; 2017; Gerasimova et al., 2018) and increased MS values (Fig. 6A, SM 1) reflecting intensive pedogenesis (cf. Bloemendal et al., 2008). The presence of dusty (dirty) coatings indicates an unprotected surface (Devos et al., 2017). The quantity of anthropogenic components including metallurgical (Fig. 11e, f), domestic, construction/destruction and excremental waste decreases

(Fig. 9), which could also indicate reducing human influence/presence. Parasite eggs indicate poor hygiene (Pichler et al., 2014; Pümpin et al., 2017; Brönnimann et al., 2020). All these components accumulated and entered to soil by trampling as proved by compaction of the sediment (Rentzel et al., 2017). It is also supported by the presence of Polygonum arenastrum in macroremains (SM 3), indicative of trampled surfaces.

The uppermost DE dated to the 9th century CE and later (Fig. 8) developed across the entire studied area (SU 1 in P1, SU 3 in P2, SU 2 in P3). This DE corresponds to a disturbed and trampled organo-mineral surface A horizon only weakly impacted by human activities compared with the other studied DEs (Fig. 9). Evidence for bioturbation includes few bow-like passage features (cf. Kooistra et al., 2010). This DE contains frequent phosphatic coatings and nodules and sporadic excrements (Fig. 11g-i), supported by significantly higher P content (Fig. 6A, SM 1). We found grains of wheat (Triticum aestivum), barley (Hordeum vulgare), and rye (Secale cereale), which could indicate the presence of crops; however, they appeared only as isolated charred remains. Similarly, field weeds like Fallopia convolvulus and Galium species were rarely documented. As such, no firm evidence for cereal cultivation on the site was found. We therefore suppose either pasture in the period when it was no longer permanently inhabited or possibly abandoned or development of wasteland or either post-depositional contamination by phosphates from upper parts of the sequence (town), for example from urban leaks that have been already observed at other sites (cf. Macphail et al., 2004; Devos et al., 2017).

Generally, the archaeobotanical analysis reveals a striking similarity in the spectrum of synanthropic species between the Early and Middle Hillfort (Great Moravia) periods, particularly the predominance of macro-remains from ruderal species like Chenopodium ssp. and Sambucus ssp. (SM 3). Notably, macro-remains of undemanding species such as Cirsium arvense and Viola arvensis were identified, which are commonly found in various anthropogenic habitats, including pastures and ruderal areas, dating back to the 8th century CE. A particularly notable find is the mineralized seed of Papaver somniferum, one of the few records from the 9th–10th centuries CE in the Czech Republic (Čech et al., 2013). Additionally, the charcoal composition (SM 3) aligns with similar Early

# 5.3.3. High Mediaeval period (from 13th century CE)

On the top of the uppermost DE, heterogeneous, microlaminated

High Mediaeval floors (Fig. 12) were preserved below younger rubble and/or building remains in some part of studied area (P2 and P3). The lowest floor surface is prepared from a  $1 - 2\mathrm{cm}$ -thick yellowish pale grey Fe-rich loam showing Mn pedofeatures in the upper part (Fig. 12B). It is succeeded by a 1-cm-thick compacted unit rich in Ca containing calcareous ashes and charcoal (Fig. 11j, k). This layer could have formed

The bar chart illustrates the percentage distribution of anthropogenic components, such as charcoal, charred material, burned bones, and others, identified in various stratigraphic units (SU) and profiles (e.g., 2/1, 6/2). Below the chart, a detailed table provides quantitative data for each component in each SU/profile, facilitating comparison and interpretation of anthropogenic activity in the sampled contexts.

as an accumulation of residues from domestic human activities or, particularly in case of ashes as the remnants of maintenance events (cf. Milek, 2012). Then, a 1-cm-thick layer of muddy yellowish pale grey Fe and Mn-rich material lightening upwards was accumulated corresponding to a new preparation layer, followed by another compacted Ca-rich layer containing charcoal and ashes again related to the occupation and/ or maintenance of the surface (Fig. 12B). The constructed floor and the top of the DE below show a platy microstructure and planar and fissure voids, witnessing intensive trampling (cf. Gé et al., 1993; Milek, 2012; Rentzel et al., 2017) (Fig. 11l). In rooms 3 and 6, the floor is buried by alluvial sediments from the turn of the 13th and 14th century CE (Fig. 8). Notably, there is a clear absence of flooding between the end of the Great Moravian settlement and the beginning of developed High Mediaeval urbanisation which probably corresponds to reduced settlement in the surrounding region. The return of regular flooding in the High Mediaeval Age continued until modern times likely resulting from intensified anthropogenic activities and significant deforestation upstream along the Morava River (cf. Kadlec et al., 2009).

The results of the archaeobotanical analysis from the High Mediaeval period are influenced by poor fossilisation conditions. Only the decay-resistant charred diaspores of synanthropic plant species (SM 3) associated with disturbed substrates and nutrient-rich areas were documented (Chenopodium album, Sambucus ebulus, Sambucus nigra). A nearby pollen record from Uherske Hradiste dated to 13th century CE (Svobodova, 1990) shows extremely high abundance (up to  $58\%$  ) of Cerealia (Triticum, Secale, Hordeum and Avena), which is quite typical for High Mediaeval towns (Kozakova et al., 2014). Generally, it rather demonstrates the difference between Early and High Mediaeval societies and town economies, than any environmental changes.

# 5.4. Interpretation of archaeological contexts integrated with geoscience insights

The discovery of a section of the extinct Morava channel represents the third find of this kind on St. George's Island. Aside from the well-known river channel ('Rechla'), similar relicts were found during research on Otakarova Street in the 1980 s (cf. Frolíková-Kaliszová, 1990; 2020). Our discovery supports the hypothesis that the centre of present-day Uherské Hradistě was previously composed of a network of islands defined by the Morava River channels, which gradually disappeared because of human activity during the Early and especially the High Mediaeval and Modern periods (Frolíková-Kaliszová, 2020).

A stable prehistoric settlement has not yet been proven on St. George's Island, only a few isolated artefacts in secondary positions have been recorded (cf. Procházka and Havlíček, 1996; Frolíková-Kaliszová, 2020). Our observations have pushed the boundary of unspecified human activities to the 6th-7th centuries CE ('Prague-type' culture period). Indeed, a layer of charcoal (Fig. 6A) and the pollen record indicate a weakly human affected forested floodplain in this period. The nearby Early Slavic settlement was documented in Zlechov (Zeman et al., 2006), Staré Město (Hrubý, 1965), Ostrožska Nova Ves (Galuska, 1990) as well as in Uherské Hradište-Sady (Fig. 2A) (Marešová, 1985).

The dating of the following human activities linked to the formation of the oldest DE (SU 8, P1) is not entirely clear, as the calibrated age (95.4% probability) presents a timeframe reaching from the second half of the 7th to the second half of the 9th century CE. The modelled age (68.3% probability) is noticeably shorter and falls from the last third of the 7th century to the first third of the 8th century CE (SM 2), which could be associated with the Early Hillfort period. Human impact on the landscape gradually increased during this period including deforestation in the surrounding. A few fragments of metallurgical waste already indicate the presence of craft workshops in the vicinity of studied area. However, direct evidence of metallurgical facilities on St. George's

Island is still lacking for this period. Nevertheless, insights into the nature of the earliest iron smelting furnaces can be drawn from other Moravian sites (cf. Merta, 2012). Considering the absence of any archaeological findings, a closer interpretation of human activities is problematic.

The human impact on the landscape intensified from the second half of the 8th century CE (Early Hillfort period), reflected in the formation of several DE layers associated with settlement activities. The situation varied spatially because of the site's geomorphology. While two DEs (SU 6 and 5) in Room 4b, P1 (Fig. 3B and 6A) resulting from multiple phases of anthropogenic activities combined with significant bioturbation

formed in a temporary flooded channel, one (SU 7) of the three DEs (SU 8-6) in Room 3 (P2) situated close to the bank (Fig. 3C and 6A), is attributed to a single dump, possibly related to the elevation of the terrain for flood protection (e.g. Nicosia et al., 2012). This part of the stratigraphy differs significantly in the central area of the site, P3 (Room 4a/4b, Fig. 6A), where it was identified as one DE containing numerous archaeological artifacts, covering the oldest archaeological features sunk into the subsoil. Archaeobotanical and micromorphological results indicate the studied area was an open space with local ruderal vegetation, intensively trampled/poached. The presence of posts and stake holes from above-ground structures (Fig. 4) could originate from a

construction for strengthening the channel bank by stakes. A similar arrangement near the channel was identified ca.  $150\mathrm{m}$  from studied site, (Snásil and Procházka, 1981; Procházka and Snásil, 1983; Snásil and Procházka, 1984; Snásil, 1987; Frolíková-Kaliszová, 1990; 2020).

In the DE dated to the end of 8th century CE (SU 5, P1), small pieces of daub and the absence of mortar suggest existence of buildings constructed using wood/wattle and clay at this occupation stage (e.g. Galuska, 2017). This is a phenomenon that is recurrently observed in mediaeval Dark Earth all over Europe (see for instance: Nicosia et al., 2017; Macphail and Devos, 2023). Some artefacts, including an iron spur fragment (Fig. 13A: 1), an iron horse bit (Fig. 13A: 10), a bronze bracelet fragment (Fig. 13A: 9), a complete brass bracelet (Fig. 13A: 2) and a silver belt buckle pin (Fig. 13A: 8) or even a counterfeit gold-

plated Arabic coin (Fig. 13A: 19) dated to 166 AH, which corresponds to August 782 to August 783 CE (determined by M. Danhel in 2024), indicate the presence of socially higher-ranking individuals on the island in this period. Previous research in the southwest corner of Mariánské Square revealed workshops for processing bones, horns, and antlers, as well as a blacksmithing and non-ferrous metal production (Snásil et al., 1984; Frolíková-Kaliszová, 2020). Slag fragments recognised by micromorphology (Table 2) could therefore correspond to metallurgical activity and the presence of craft workshops in the proximity. The production could be linked to market exchange which generally facilitates the advancement of specialised production in agricultural and craft sectors by directly mobilising resources from producers and enabling households to acquire necessary goods (Minc, 2006). This market

exchange or even marketplace could exist as early as the 8th century on St. George's Island. A market based on long-distance trade facilitated the emergence of a local social elite, raising the question of whether the development of the Stare Mesto-Uherske Hradiste agglomeration might have followed a different trajectory than previously assumed (cf. Galuska, 2013).

New DEs formed probably from the first half of the 9th century CE (Middle Hillfort period or Great Moravia). Notably, flood sediments (SU 4, P1 and 2; SU 3, P3) separating two main phases of an Early Mediaeval settlement, were documented in nearly all previous excavations in the city centre (Kuchar, 2023; Frolíková-Kaliszová, 2020), indicating that

the flood event(s) affected the entire St. George's Island area. The situation again varies within the investigated area (Fig. 6A). Although three different DEs (SU 3-1) developed in the channel (P1), just one DE horizon (SU 2) was documented in the central part (P3). The channel was gradually filled in, either spontaneously or at some episodes intentionally, as documented by the lowest DEs, and lost its function. It contains a lot of indicators for cultivation, suggesting extensive farming in the surrounding area but as shown by the micromorphological data, not directly in the studied area. Further development indicates an open space still intensively influenced by various human activities. The DEs (SU 3-1, P1) contained a wider range of typologically diverse

archaeological finds than the previous cultural layer, although the finds were less numerous. Noteworthy are fragments of lime mortar and plaster (Fig. 11b), indicating the destruction of unspecified structure(s) nearby and thus a spatial re-organisation of the area. A preliminary analysis of construction element imprints suggests that some mortar pieces bonded stones, while other pieces with wattle impressions came from a wooden structure. Similar constructions were identified at Early Mediaeval agglomerations of Pohansko near Břeclav, Stare Mesto and Mikulcice (e.g. Galuska and Poláček, 2006; Macháček et al., 2014). Thuse, the site provides evidence of the advanced building techniques used during the Great Moravian period, incorporating wattle with mortar in their architectural practises (whether sacral or secular), highlighting the island's significant role within the Stare Mesto-Uherské Hradisté agglomeration.

In addition to common everyday items, the DE contained metal artefacts (Fig. 13B) and a damaged glass bead (Fig. 13B: 24) and a fragment of an iron currency bar (Fig. 13B: 32), considered a form of precoinage currency in Moravia (e.g. Hlavica et al., 2020; Hlavica and Bárta, 2021). A unique find is a flat, stick-like object with three copper holes, that is preliminarily interpreted as a balance arm (Fig. 13B: 25). There were several small, cut pieces of lead (Fig. 13B: 26, 28) nearby, which might have served as weights. Great Moravia had a sophisticated economy, which included long-distance trade connections with Western and Eastern Europe and the establishment of marketplaces. It is assumed that in the 9th century CE, there was one such market in the centre of the nearby Stare Mesto (Kouril, 2014; Hlavica et al., 2023). All above-mentioned uncovered artefacts, micromorphological observation evidencing artisanal waste (cf. Wouters et al., 2017), the position in the corner of recent-day square (Fig. 2B) and the evidence of the existence of markets in the Great Moravia period can support the hypothesis

regarding the presence of a marketplace or trade/exchange place in the vicinity of the studied area. The Marianske Square hosted a town market from the High Middle Ages to the early 20th century CE (Čoupkova and Coupek, 2007), which could reinforce the hypothesis regarding a previous marketplace in this area.

The uppermost DE (SU 1, P1; SU 2, P3; Fig. 6A), rich in nutrients, was formed after the Great Moravian settlement probably from the 10th century CE (Fig. 8). Because of the lack of dates, we cannot further detail the formation period. Human impacts on the landscape decreased, and the site was likely abandoned or used only sporadically. This finding is consistent with the results of previous research in the centre of Uherské Hradistě, where we currently lack intensive evidence of settlement from the Late Hillfort Period (10th-12th centuries; Procházka and Doležel, 2001; Frolíková-Kaliszová, 2020). If any human activities took place on St. George's Island, they were probably related to the surrounding settlements in nearby Staré Město, where the population moved from its original central location to the areas known as 'Na Dedine' and 'Na Zahrádkách', and/or in Uherské Hradistě-Sady 'Spitálky' (Galuska, 200b; Fig. 2A). A similar scenario is known from the Early Mediaeval agglomeration of Pohansko, which was abandoned in the 10th century CE, leading to the settlement expanding into the surrounding areas (Dresler, 2016).

On the parcel that we examined, oak piles used to anchor an unspecified structure dated back to the first third of the 13th century CE (Late Hillfort period) were driven into older Early Mediaeval DE in room 6. The structure could be hypothetically linked to the existence of a small fishing village with a chapel referenced by written sources even before the establishment of the royal town itself in CE 1257 (Mitáček and Procházka, 2007) and could be assessed as the initial phase of urbanisation in Uherské Hradistě. The remains of High Mediaeval

buildings/houses have survived here only in fragments as oak piles dated to CE 1210-1281, thin floor horizons (for details see Section 4.2.3) and a few shallow features sunk into the uppermost DE. We also documented fence made of thin stakes woven with willow twigs and organic-rich deposits interpreted as a manure heap (Bartík and Chrástek, 2018). Wattle fences dividing areas into small plots are typical of early towns including Uhersné Hradistě (Procházka, 2022; Procházka and Snásil, 1984; Mitáček and Procházka, 2007).

# 6. Conclusion

The archaeological investigations conducted at Marianske Square provided significant insights into the landscape, paleoenvironment, and human settlement development on St. George's Island in Uherske Hradiste. The geomorphological and environmental conditions of the island located in the river's floodplain and the building foundations directly built on contributed to the preservation of DEs and archaeological contexts that would have otherwise been lost because of pedogenesis. By applying a diverse range of geoarchaeological, paleoenvironmental and dating methods, we can now interpret the obtained data within broader historical and spatial context. The micromorphological analysis and archaeological investigation provided greater stratigraphic details and enhanced the interpretation of both natural and human activities from proto-urban to urban societies in the 6th–14th centuries AD, which included occupation phases and periods of soil formation interspersed with episodes of flooding and floodplain aggradation. The first stable settlement of St. George's Island began at the transition of the 7th and 8th centuries AD. The area under study represented a trampled open space close to metallurgical workshops. More mature and more human-influenced DEs formed from the second half to the end of 8th century CE. The presence of specific artefacts linked to higher-status individuals and evidence of specialised artisanal activities suggest a complex societal structure in Uherske Hradiste with significant economic and social interactions based on the development of controlled long-distance trade. At the end of the 8th and 9th centuries CE the site was flooded. However, settlement in the area was renewed. New DEs developed from the first third of the 9th century CE when the site belonged to an important settlement area of the Great Moravian Empire. The study of these DEs revealed a series of activities such as levelling of the terrain (mainly from building rubble containing mortar) and the associated re-organization of the space, cultivation in the vivinity as well as the proximity of craft workshops and the presence of a marketplace. The site was already probably an essential trading centre in this period. From the beginning of the 10th century CE, the site was probably abandoned. The settlement re-established at the beginning of the 13th century CE representing the first traces of urbanisation and the early formation of mediaeval city Uherske Hradiste founded after CE 1257. The town was hit by another flood at the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries AD, probably caused by intensification of settlement activities in the catchment.

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the Early Mediaeval functioning of the island, uncovering a larger portion of the production and exchange areas, particularly metallurgical sites, is crucial. Future research should also focus on interpreting structures containing significant amounts of mortar or lime plaster, as these could indicate the presence of churches, palaces, or other important buildings in the period of Great Moravia. Discovering and interpreting these structures would significantly enhance our understanding of the island's role and the broader settlement dynamics during this period.
