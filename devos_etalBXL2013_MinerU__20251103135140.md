# ABSTRACT

Soil micromorphology has become an important tool in urban archaeology to investigate enigmatic dark, humus-rich, apparently homogeneous units, known as Dark Earth. It has also proven to be of great value to study microstratified sequences (such as floors), allowing a finer grained picture. Phytolith studies have also shown to be of particular interest to investigate archaeological layers, especially where other botanical remains are poorly preserved. The integration of phytolith studies and micromorphology allows understanding of the distribution and orientation patterns of the phytoliths and their relation to other features/fabrics, contributing to a better understanding of taphonomical processes and the identification of different human activities.

The aim of the present article is to demonstrate the possibilities of such an integrated approach by the example of the site of the Court of Hoogstraeten, situated near the top of a steep slope, next to the Palace of the Dukes in the centre of Brussels (Belgium). The present article focuses on one complex sequence that includes two levels of Dark Earth and a microstratified sequence.

The integrated study demonstrates that the formation of the Dark Earth on the site of the Court of Hoogstraeten results from multiphased processes, whereby various human actions interact with natural phenomena. Among the human activities pasturing, crop growing, manuring and composting have been identified. The microstratified sequence has been identified as a potential floor layer. As such, this approach does not only allow understanding the site formation processes both from homogenised units like Dark Earth, and microstratified ones, but also identification of ancient activities that are rather difficult to interpret based on field data alone.

# 1. Introduction

Since 1996, the Direction of Monuments and Sites of the Brussels Capital Region conducts a systematic archaeological assessment on all construction sites. This includes archaeological intervention whenever archaeological remains are at risk. During numerous interventions in the historical centre of Brussels, up to  $1\mathrm{m}$  thick, homogeneous, dark coloured, humic horizons, also known as Dark Earth have been uncovered (Devos et al., 2011a). Such Dark Earths have for a long time been considered as being of ephemeral interest. However, in recent decades there has been a

growing awareness of the archaeological potential of such units often observed in urban stratigraphy (Macphail, 1981; Brogiolo et al., 1988; Macphail, 1994; David et al., 2000; Verslype and Brulet, 2004; Goldberg and Macphail, 2006: 235; Fondrillon, 2009; Borderie, 2011; Brogiolo, 2011). The application of the expression Dark Earth in archaeological literature is varied. Sensu stricto, it can be defined as 'the levels in between the stratifications of antique cities (between the 1st and the 3rd century) and the medieval ones (from the 11th-12th century onwards)' (Cammas, 2004; David, 2004; Galinié, 2004; Macphail and Linderholm, 2004; Nicosia and Devos, 2013). Dark Earth has also been applied as a synonym for the Amazonian 'Terra Preta' (Lima et al., 2002; Arroyo-Kalin et al., 2003; Glaser and Woods, 2004) and by extension to some peculiar soil horizons on the African continent (Fairhead and Leach, 2009). However, in recent years a tendency developed to extend the definition of Dark Earth sensu largo as a

strictly descriptive term for dark, humic, non-peaty, homogeneous units (Heimdahl, 2005; Devos et al., 2009, 2011a). It is this last definition that will be applied in the present contribution.

During the last decades, there have been various attempts to develop appropriate research protocols to understand the creation, evolution and archaeological significance of these units. Among the disciplines that often contribute to the study of Dark Earth are micro-archaeology (Laurent, 2004; Fondrillon, 2007), archaeobotany (Macphail, 1981; David et al., 2000; David, 2004; Heimdahl, 2005), archaeopedology (Macphail and Linderholm, 2004; Nicosa et al., 2012), micromorphology (Macphail, 1994; Cammas, 2000, 2004; Macphail and Linderholm, 2004), geophysics (David et al., 2000; David, 2004), malacology (David et al., 2000; David, 2004) and archaeozooology (David et al., 2000; David, 2004). Although some interdisciplinary studies exist (e.g. Macphail, 1981), these disciplines have mostly been applied independently (Kooistra and Kooistra, 2003; David, 2004). Phytoliths have often been reported, but examples of their integration within the study of Dark Earth remain rare (see Devos et al., 2009).

Finely stratified levels like floors have for a long time been a particular point of interest to soil micromorphologists (see for example Courty et al., 1989; Gé et al., 1993; Goldberg and Macphail, 2006: 244-246; Macphail and Goldberg, 2010). Often the presence of phytoliths has been reported, but examples of the integration of both approaches (Matthews, 2010; Shillito, 2011) are rare.

The present contribution adopts a research protocol integrating archaeology, archaeopedology and phytolith analyses. We will verify whether the formation processes of the archaeological layers can be understood and evaluate how such a study contributes to the understanding of the site. It includes the development of a common research protocol and a joint sampling strategy allowing continuous cross-checking of the data.

The objective of this article is to evaluate the potential of such integrated research through the case study of the site of the Court of Hoogstraeten. This site has been chosen as it presents a complex sequence with two well-preserved different levels of Dark Earth, from two different periods, but also a microlaminated sequence. The interpretations will then be placed in the wider context of the development of Brussels and its environment.

which is not possible when relying on bulk samples (see for example Shillito, 2011). As such, it can inform about the processes leading to their incorporation within the archaeological units.

Phytoliths are plant microfossils. Their study provides data on past plant communities in view of palaeoenvironmental and/or archaeobotanical studies (for illustration see Piperno, 1988, 2006). The latter studies rely on morphotypological analysis. Taken into account that opal phytoliths accumulate within plant tissues, their deposition as sedimentary particles implies decomposition of plant organs. In archaeological contexts, a great variety of agents such as fire (Madella, 2003), dung deposition and/or decomposition (Powers-Jones, 1994; Albert, 2002; Shahack-Gross, 2011) and plant processing (Harvey and Fuller, 2005) can be at the origin of plant tissue decomposition. Following the incorporation of phytoliths into the sediment, fossil diagenesis (sensu Madella and Lancelotti (2012)) might occur leading to specific (combinations of) distribution patterns within the sediments. Combining both types of evidence should compose the major contribution of a micromorphologically oriented phytolith analysis. However, developing such an approach implies an evaluation of its reliability. To encounter this aim and complementary to previous evaluations (Vrydaghs et al., 2007), three test procedures were performed:

- replication of the observations;  
- comparison of spectra established for bulk samples and thin sections;  
- comparison of thin sections from different urban medieval sites.

The replication of the observations takes into account the distribution patterns of the phytoliths, but also the morphotypological analysis. A first description was conducted by scanning the entire width of the thin section (line-scanning - step 1). To cross-check the observations, the scanning was conducted along two lines. Subsequently, the replication of the observations included areal counting on specific zones delimited by the micromorphologists, e.g. zones showing no particular features like coprolites (step 2). The differences between both analyses are detailed in Tables 2 and 3. More diversified distribution patterns were observed during step 2. This observation shows that the occurrence of the phytoliths is not necessarily uniform, demonstrating the importance of taking into account soil variability.

# 2. Phytolith analysis: a micromorphological approach

Phytoliths have been chosen as an archaeobotanical proxy, as they do not need to be waterlogged or charred to be preserved (Piperno, 1988; Madella and Lancelotti, 2012; Shillito, 2013). This is of particular interest, as an important part of the urban stratigraphy is not waterlogged. Charred remains, on the other hand, can often be related to added material (ashes, domestic waste) (Charruadas et al., 2013) and as such they do not provide direct evidence of in situ vegetation.

The purpose of the phytolith analysis of soil thin sections is to present a comprehensive study of the phytoliths recorded during the scanning of thin sections. This approach does not only allow the identification of the phytoliths, but also to record their distribution,

The comparison of the spectra established for bulk samples and thin sections has been performed on sandy and loamy Dark Earth from several sites in the centre of Brussels (Table 4): rue de Dinant (Devos et al., 2009), impasse du Papier (Devos et al., 2011c), Treurenberg (Vrydaghs et al., 2007) and the Court of Hoogstraeten (Devos et al., 2011c). Although some differences are noted, the significant morphotype categories are not substantially affected by varying occurrences within the spectra.

was demonstrated within the architecture. As such, terraces were realised on the Coudenberg to enable the construction of the prestigious buildings with large gardens, such as the palace of the Dukes and the Court of Hoogstraeten. The garden of the Court of Hoogstraeten covered a surface of almost  $1000\mathrm{m}^2$ . These transformations certainly had an enormous impact on the original morphology of the Coudenberg (Cnockaert and Modrie, 2013). In 1731, a great fire destroyed the palace of Charles the Fifth. In 1775,

Comparison of thin sections from different urban medieval sites in Brussels, Strasbourg and Antwerp demonstrates that the phytolith analysis of thin sections records not only grass signatures (Vrydaghs et al., 2007; Devos et al., 2009, 2013; Nicosa et al., 2013). These procedures, of which the extensive results and discussion are beyond the scope of present contribution and will be presented elsewhere, highlight that phytolith analysis of thin sections is reliable and might be rewarding in terms of palaeoenvironmental and/or archaeobotanical studies.

# 3. Site description

The site of the Court of Hoogstraeten is situated next to the ancient palace of the Dukes, also known as the Palace of Charles the Fifth (Fig. 1), near the top of a steep slope leading to the Bruxellian plateau, the Coudenberg, at an altitude of ca.  $60\mathrm{m}$  above sea level. According to the geotechnical map, the archaeological layers are situated directly on top of the Paleogene Brussellian sands (Dam et al., 1977).

Since the 12th century, the Coudenberg was a seat of power dominating the city of Brussels. Its dominant plateau position was certainly recognised by the inhabitants of the settlement preceding the city, and one can easily imagine that the hill was occupied before the 12th century (Vannieuwenhuyze, 2008). With the installation of the palace of the Dukes, the elevated social position

the whole district was completely remodelled, and the 'place Royale' was constructed on top of the remains of the ancient palace and the Court of Hoogstraeten (Modrie and Demeter, 2002; Cnockaert and Modrie, 2013). All ancient remains were thus sealed, until the excavations carried out since 1998 by the Royal Museums of Art and History and the Brussels Capital Region. During these excavations, thick Dark Earth has been unearthed. The present article focuses on the trenches, situated in the 'ancient garden' of the Court of Hoogstraeten (Fig. 1) presenting a complex stratigraphy of Dark Earth and microstratified units.

According to the archaeological material and  $^{14}\mathrm{C}$  dating, the upper one dates from the 16th-17th century AD (see Table 1). According to historical documents, it could be related to the garden of the Court of Hoogstraeten (Modrie and Demeter, 2002; Cnockaert and Modrie, 2013). The lower Dark Earth, is much older, dating to the 10th-12th century AD (see Table 1), period where the historians suspect the start of the urbanisation of Brussels (Degraeve et al., 2010).

# 4.1. Field study

Field descriptions have been realised according to the "Comprehensive Field Data Bases" (Langohr, 1994) and the

A: location of the site of the Court of Hoogstraeten in the centre of Brussels; B: location of the studied trenches in the former garden of the ancient Palace of Hoogstraeten (a), next to the former chapel and palace of the Dukes (b); C: the studied soil profiles. The small rectangles on the profiles indicate the location of the block samples.

"Guidelines for soil profile description" (F.A.O., 1990). Adapted checklists have been applied for the description of associated soil traces (Fechner et al., 2004). Bulk samples and undisturbed oriented blocks for micromorphology, physico-chemical analyses and phytolith study were taken from the available soil profiles from three trenches to take into account lateral variability (TR 40; TR 56 and TR 71) (Fig. 1).

# 4.2. Micromorphology

Thin sections  $8\mathrm{cm}$  long and  $6\mathrm{cm}$  wide were prepared from the air dried undisturbed block samples following standard procedures by the laboratory of T. Beckmann (Germany; see Beckmann, 1997) and included resin impregnation under vacuum and precision grinding to a thickness of  $30~{\mu\mathrm{m}}$

The thin sections are described following the international nomenclature of the 'Handbook for soil thin section description'

(Bullock et al., 1985) and the 'Guidelines for analysis and description of soil and regolith thin sections' (Stoops, 2003). Some seminumerical counting has been performed according to Macphail and Cruise (2001) and Borderie (2011). The quantification of porosity, quartz/feldspars and opaque elements is based on the analysis of digital images using ImageJ software (Devos, 2012).

For the phytolith analyses, the observations were conducted on one reference profile (TR 40) for the lower Dark Earth. In order to check the variability of the results, a second sequence has been studied (TR 71). The upper Dark Earth has been studied on the main reference profile: TR 56.

The phytolith study relies on the analysis of soil thin sections and took place after the micromorphological study (see Section 2). The analyses were conducted following Vrydaghs et al. (2007, 2013). The method includes a morphotypological analysis and the recording of the distribution of the phytoliths, in order to take fully into account their taphonomical history.

Fig. 2. Trench 56, US 2337: isolated phytolith relevant of the A2 category according to Runge's inventory (1999).PPL,  $400\times$

Counting of the phytoliths observed in thin sections has been realised following Vrydaghs, 2013. This semi-numerical analysis consists of:

- a systematic recording of each distribution pattern of the phytoliths: isolated, (Fig. 2) clustered(Fig. 3) or articulated (Fig. 8) (the latter being either contiguous or silica skeleton);  
- their subsequent morphotypological analysis;  
- finally, the counting of the phytoliths within each distribution pattern.

In order to take into account soil variability (see Section 2), these analyses were conducted for three squares with a surface of  $25\mathrm{mm}^2$ $(5\times 5\mathrm{mm})$  per unit. Their selection relies on the previously conducted micromorphological analysis of the thin sections.

The morphotypological analyses follow a revised version of Runge's (1999) inventory. The latter takes into consideration shape,

texture and ornamentation of the phytoliths. Consisting of an open system of eight categories labelled from A to G, they are subdivided into as much subcategories as requested. It makes the classification system easily applicable to almost all geographical and ecological areas, as illustrated by other studies (Vrydaghs, 2003; Vrydaghs et al., 2004). However, having been set up for Tropical Africa and more specifically, the forest belt, its application to north-western Europe implied substantial revisions, mainly of the G category under which fall all the morphologies deriving from the Graminae and Cyperaceae. These revisions rely mainly on Kaplan et al. (1992), Brown (1984) and Fredlund and Tieszen (1994). Naming of the phytoliths was conducted according to the ICPN 1.0 (Madella et al., 2005).

Complementarily and in order to take fully into account the potential origin of the phytoliths, separate observations were made on a series of identified materials: coprolites and fired clay fragments. For both micromorphological and phytolith approaches, observations were made with a petrological microscope under plain polarised light (PPL), under crossed polarizers (XPL) and with oblique incident light (OIL) at magnifications of  $25\times$ ,  $100\times$ ,  $400\times$  and  $1000\times$ . The thin sections were equally scanned under UV and blue fluorescence at  $400\times$  magnification.

# 4.3. Physico-chemical analyses

After gentle crushing, the air-dried bulk soil samples were passed through a  $2\mathrm{mm}$  sieve. Particle size distribution of the  $< 2\mathrm{mm}$  fraction by sieving and sedimentation has been performed by the laboratory of INRA-Arras following AFNOR NF-X 31-107 (Baize, 2000). This laboratory also performed several chemical analyses, following NF and NF ISO standard procedures published by the French Association for Normalisation (AFNOR, 1999):

- Soil pH  $(\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O})$  in deionized water with a soil/water ratio of 1:2 (NF ISO 10390).  
- Organic carbon after dry combustion according to NF ISO 10694.  
- Nitrogen after dry combustion according to NF ISO 13878.  
- The cation exchange capacity (CEC) after exchange with a  $36~\mathrm{mM}$  ammonium oxalate solution according to Metson, AFNOR NF X 31-130.  
- Exchangeable cations  $\mathrm{Ca}^{+ + }$ $\mathrm{Mg}^{+ + }$ $\mathbf{K}^+$ $\mathrm{Na^{+}}$  in  $1\textrm{M}$  ammonium acetate extracted soil samples according to AFNOR NF X 31- 108.  
- Heavy metal analyses:

$\bigcirc$  Cu, Zn, Ni (total HF ICP-AES) according to NF ISO 11885.  
$\bigcirc$  Pb, Cd (total HF ICP-MS) according to method INRA (Baize, 2000).

Organic and inorganic phosphorus have been determined at the laboratory of Soil Science at the University of Ghent by adding  $10\mathrm{ml}$ $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{SO}_4$  to a burned and an unburned sample. The intensity of the blue colour is measured using a colorimeter (Mikkelsen, 1997; Devos et al., 2011b). Similarity indices (Comparative Particle Size Distribution index matrices) have been calculated following Langohr et al. (1976).

# 4.4.  $^{14}C$  dating

$^{14}\mathrm{C}$  dating on charcoal fragments was performed at the Beta Analytic Radiocarbon Dating Laboratory (Miami, U.S.A.). In order to make the dates as reliable as possible, charcoal fragments of short lived species such as birch (Betula sp.) and common beech (Fagus sylvatica) have been chosen (Deligne, n.d.; Devos et al., 2011a).

# 5. Results

The field data are summarized in Table 5. Table 1 reports the results of  $^{14}\mathrm{C}$  dating, Fig. 4 the granulometrical analysis, Table 7 the Similarity-indices and Table 6 the chemical data. The main micromorphological characteristics are presented in Table 8.

The results of the phytolith analysis of the thin sections of the site of Court of Hoogstraten are presented in Table 9, and Figs. 5-7. Table 9 details the semi-numerical data of the phytolith analysis.

of the isolated phytoliths and Fig. 7 focuses on the relative frequencies of dendritic phytoliths deriving from cultivated cereals (Triticum sp., Hordeum sp. and/or Avena sp.).

One coprolite in unit 2331 contained a combination of articulated and isolated phytoliths. The former include dendritics (G5) (Fig. 8), rondels (G1.1) and elongate rectangular (G4), and isolated rondells (G1.1) and non-identified phytoliths are also reported. The occurrence of a lobate morphotype within another coprolite is not excluded. In the fired clay fragments inclusions, a single elongated rectangular phytolith (A3) within the fired fabric is recorded.

# 6. Interpretation and discussion

# 6.1. The parent material

According to the Geotechnical map (Dam et al., 1977), the site is characterized by Paleocene (Brusselian) sediments that are covered with anthropogenic deposits. However, field observations (Table 5), combined with the granulometrical analyses (Fig. 4) and micromorphology (Table 8), demonstrate a more complex sequence than that presented on the Geotechnical map.

Brusselian sands have been observed in the field, but on top of these, a more sandy loam parent material has been observed (see Fig. 4: US 7340, US 7341). More detailed investigations show the presence of clay migration bands (Fig. 9), suggesting the presence of a luvisol. However, part of the horizons seems to be missing (A, E-horizon and part of the Bt) or are incorporated within the Dark Earth (see below). As phytoliths are rare and mainly isolated, they are probably related to postdepositional processes like bioturbation. Some recent experiments on phytolith transport indicate that water percolation also plays a role (Fishkis et al., 2009, 2010).

# 6.2. The lower Dark Earth

The lower Dark Earth has been subdivided into several subunits. For trench TR 40: US 7339, US 7338 and US 7321; for trench TR 71: US 7539 and US 7540; and for trench TR 56: US 2334, US 2339 and

US 2341. The very high similarity indices (Table 7), combined with a very similar mineralogical composition of the Dark Earth and the parent material (Table 8), indicate that the formation of the Dark Earth is merely the consequence of the reworking of the existing soil, in combination with the addition of some inclusions and taken into account the slope position of the site, possibly some local sediments (colluvium). Among the inclusions, ceramics, bone, charcoal and dung have been identified (Table 8).

# 6.2.1. The pasture land

Locally, at the base of the Dark Earth (TR 40: US 7339), some relics suggesting the presence of a grassland cover have been observed. Characteristics are the presence of an undulating lower base, full of galleries (Table 5, Fig. 10), partly resulting from mole activity (personal communication Roger Langohr, Ghent University, ASDIS), an elevated porosity mainly composed of channels, the ubiquitous presence of organo-mineral excremental aggregates with a diameter of ca.  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  (Fig. 11), indicating mixing caused by mesofaunal activity (Macphail, 1994; Cammas, 2000, 2004; Guttmann et al., 2006). The combination of these data suggests the presence of a grass-covered soil surface possibly used for grazing (Courty et al., 1989: 129-130). The dominance of trapeziforms, in combination with the occurrence of lobate morphotypes, are consistent with the identification of a grassland cover (Fig. 6). Chemical data indicate a slight increase in phosphorus levels and a low C/N ratio. The enhanced phosphorus levels can also be associated with the grazing activity, although some downward phosphorus movement cannot be excluded. In this respect we point to the presence of layered clay coatings, where the dusty ones can be related to later activities (see further). The low C/N ratio is indicative of high biological activity with rapid decomposition of the organic matter (Nørnberg and Dalsgaard, 1982).

# 6.2.2. The plough layers

Several units have been observed indicating agricultural activities: TR 40: units 7321, 7338; TR 71: unit 7539, 7540; TR 56: 2334, 2339, 2341.

Semi-numerical data of the phytolith analysis of the Dark Earth of the Court of Hoogstraten. Diversity: Dp, diversity in distribution patterns; Dm, diversity in morphotypological classes following an updated version of the Runge's inventory (1999). Abundance: Total: sum of the amount of phytoliths recorded while scanning three squares (sq), each of  $25\mathrm{mm}^2$ ; Mean: mean abundance of the phytoliths considering all the distribution patterns (Isolated, Clustered, Articulated and Silica skeletons); sd: standard deviation from the Mean abundance (see also Fig. 5). Units 7321, 7338 and 7539, identified as former crop fields, are the richest in phytoliths, either in terms of diversity or abundance. They also present a wider variation in their phytolith content. Units 2331 and 2337, identified as former gardens, are poorer in phytoliths, with a less well marked variability. The former grassland (US 7339) presents intermediate values. Units 7340 and 7341, clearly attest of the poorest phytolith content.

The more or less straight lower boundary, the humic character (see Tables 6 and 7), in combination with the presence of strongly fragmented and randomly distributed anthropogenic elements (e.g. charcoal, bone, ceramics), dusty clay coatings, short wavy lenses of dusty (probably humus rich) clay silt (e.g. textural pedofeatures: see Simpson, 1997) and angular soil fragments (Table 8), all indicate thorough reworking of a topsoil (French, 2003: 49-55; Devos et al., 2009). The short wavy lenses are probably the remains of surface crusts that have been mixed deeper into the soil due to reworking of the soil with particular tools (spade, ard or plough). Such surface crusts are formed due to the breakdown of surface aggregates into finer fragments reducing water infiltration and enhancing soil erosion (Langohr, 1990; Bresson and Valentin, 1994), a typical phenomenon observed on agricultural soils (Courty et al., 1989: 130; Macphail et al., 1990). Also, in the lower part of the section (US 7339-7340-7341) multiple generations of textural pedofeatures have been observed, pointing to a change in the environment. The oldest are limpid clay coatings, generally associated with weathering and clay translocation in luvisols, possibly under undisturbed broadleaved woodland (Fedoroff and Goldberg, 1982; Macphail

et al., 1987). The younger ones are more dusty to silty (Fig. 12), typical for disturbed soils (Macphail et al., 1990; French, 2003: 53-54), and resulting from infiltration from the units on top.

The plough layers appear to be very rich in phytoliths. However, they indicate significant variation (Fig. 5). These units are the only ones showing three different distribution patterns: isolated (Fig. 13), clustered (Fig. 14) and articulated (Fig. 15). By definition articulated distribution patterns are those occurring within the plant tissues, implying that the plant material decomposed after incorporation within the soil.

The observed clusters consist of various phytoliths, all derived from grasses, but viewed under several orientations. Their distribution within the plant tissues has thus not been preserved, pointing to postdepositional disturbances. The isolated phytoliths can have various origins. However, their morphotypical analysis does not show significant differences with those of the articulated and clustered phytoliths (Table 10). As such, at least part of these phytoliths can have the same botanical origin as those composing the other two distribution patterns. The fact that the three distribution patterns occur simultaneously is consistent with

the physical reworking of a topsoil, as witnessed by the other micromorphological observations. However, the erosion and corrosion features on part of the phytoliths suggest that not all the phytoliths share the same depositional history.

The morphotypological analysis identified the presence of direct markers for cultivated crops (Avena sp.). Although recorded for several units, they are more frequent within the plough units (Fig. 7). As these phytoliths are perfectly released from the organic

Whilst for US 7339, phytoliths occur almost equally as isolated and articulated, for all the other units the phytoliths are mainly isolated. This dominance is well marked for US 7340, 7341, 2331, 2337 and 2231 and significantly less for US 7321 and 7338. The latter 2 units present also an association of three distribution patterns (isolated, clustered and articulated) complemented by one occurrence of a silica skeleton for US 7321 (see dp, Table 4).

US 7339, identified as a former grassland is clearly dominated by the trapeziforms (G1.1) while units 7321, 7338 and 7539 interpreted as former plough lands, present a higher frequency of dendriforms (G5).

matter and as they do not present any traces of melting or any blackish coating, they are probably not related to cereal processing waste. As their distribution is not related to any peculiar feature such as coprolites or phosphatic nodules, dung does not seem to be the only potential source of phytolith deposition (Devos et al., 2009). Moreover, as part of the dendritics (G5) are articulated (Fig. 16), a local origin of at least part of the crop phytoliths can be proposed, thus relating them to in situ agricultural activities.

Based on morphological criteria (Rosen, 1992; Vrydaghs et al., 2007), phytolith analysis identifies Avena sp. This seems not to be the only cereal crop represented in the phytolith record, as several G5 morphologies typical for cereals have been observed. However, it has not been possible to firmly identify them.

The micromorphological study demonstrates the addition of several materials. As such, there is evidence for the addition of domestic (kitchen) waste, as suggested by the combined presence of ash, charcoal, charred seeds, bone and ceramics (Pieters, 1990; Simpson et al., 1998, 2000; Macphail and Goldberg, 2010). Within these units, some elongated phytoliths (A) present a blackish appearance, understood as a carbon coating, suggesting they have been affected by fire (Luc Vrydaghs, personal observations on reference material from the Roman villa of Bruyelles, Belgium; see also Devos et al., 2009; Matthews, 2010), and as such do not share the same depositional history as the other phytoliths. The occurrence of a blackish silica skeleton supports this concept (Fig. 17). Possibly these phytoliths are also related to the addition of kitchen and/or cereal processing waste (see Devos et al., 2009).

Another source seems to be the accumulation of excremental waste. Direct evidence is coprolithic remains. Indirect evidence is phosphatic nodules and crystal intergrowths (Devos et al., 2009), and sclerotia, which are often found in relation to excrement and/or

decomposing leaves (Personal communication by Kristin Ismael-Meyer, IPNA, Universität Basel). In combination with the presence of iron and phosphate stained humified organic matter and dark dusty clay coatings, this suggests the input of manure, possibly from a stable (personal communication of Richard Macphail, University College London). Further evidence for the accumulation of material is small soil fragments showing very limited porosity. These are probably construction remains (floors or walls made of clay/silt) that were incorporated in the soil by biological reworking and weathering effects, as has been observed on London Dark Earth (Macphail, 1994, 2003).

All these additions suggest that the soil has been manured (Pieters, 1990; Bakels, 1997; Simpson et al., 1998, 2005). This is consistent with the chemical data (Table 6). Enhanced values of phosphorus and organic matter are observed, as well as a low  $C / N$  ratio, favouring agricultural activities. Moreover, the anomalous high mesofaunal activity, as witnessed by the ubiquitous presence of excremental organo-mineral micro-aggregates (Macphail, 1994; Cammas, 2004; Guttmann et al., 2006), points to enhanced base levels in what was naturally an acidic and earthworm poor soil

(Langohr, 2001; Goldberg and Macphail, 2006: 206). This seems to be confirmed by the chemical data (see Table 6, base levels).

The total thickness of the agricultural layer (ca.  $30~\mathrm{cm}$ ) points to additional soil accretion. Different processes can explain such accumulations:

- The input of windblown sands. However, this would have been a minor factor, as only very slight enrichment of the plough layers with sandy material is observed (see Fig. 4 and Table 7). Moreover, part of this sandy material can be the result of the breakdown of construction remains.  
- The addition of soil plaggen. However, no evidence such as peat fragments (Simpson et al., 2000, 2005) or soil fragments rich in diatoms and grass phytoliths (Gebhardt and Langohr, 1999) supporting this hypothesis has been observed.  
- Continuous adding of manure. This is a rather slow process, as most of the added manure was probably of organic origin

A third phytolith is under side view exhibiting the apex of the lateral process (b). The main axe of this latter phytolith is not parallel with those of the phytoliths under top view. From a fourth phytolith only the extremity of the processes can clearly be seen (c). Again, the extremities almost touch the main body of the opposite phytolith.

The breakdown of such construction remains can result in the liberation of small amounts of clay, and high amounts of coarse silt and very fine sand (Macphail, 2003). This can partly account for the small differences in particle size distribution noted between the different units.

- Colluviation, especially because the site is situated along a rather steep slope. However, taken into account the bioturbation, this is rather hard to prove.  
- A combination of both of the latter phenomena, which seems to best account for the observations in this case.

# 6.3. The potential floor layer

On top of the Dark Earth, a thin layer (US 7337) has been observed. Field observations suggested that the layer was composed of burned wood. Importantly, this layer shows almost no traces of bioturbation, suggesting rapid burial.

The lower part of this layer (US 7337b) is rich in discontinuous burnt layers of charred organic material. This layer also contains articulated phytoliths, among which are somewhat altered as well

as apparently molten materials (Fig. 18). Some reddened silt/clay fragments have been observed.

In the upper part (US 7337a) several phosphorus crusts, often associated with articulated phytoliths are observed (US 7337a). These crusts compose a more or less continuous system throughout the width of the thin section making of this specific feature the richest one in phytoliths. This also points to the absence of post-depositional disturbance.

Phytolith distribution patterns combine articulated phytoliths and clusters. Restricted evidence for isolated phytoliths is also recorded. Articulated phytoliths are mostly under side view and distributed along lines (Fig. 19) or bands (Figs. 20 and 21). Phytoliths within clusters attest to varying orientation ranging from top to side views with intermediate orientations. Although these aspects hamper the morphotypical analysis, some data could be gained:

- Lines and bands are mostly composed of articulated rondells (G1.1), dendritics (G5) and in some cases, conduction pieces (A1);  
- Dendritics (G5), rondels (G1.1), appendage phytoliths (G3), elongate rectangular (G4) as well as blocky polyhedral compose the cluster spectra.

All these morphotypes point to a grass signature potentially made of several plant organs including glumes and leaves. Shafts are not excluded. This suggests the presence of a kind of mat or straw. As these phytoliths occur as continuous lines and bands, they are not related to dung, where one would expect broken strands of articulated phytoliths due to chewing by animals (Milek and Roberts, 2013). However, part of the phytolith record has been observed in clusters and these phytoliths might be related to the presence of dung.

Fig. 21. Detail of Fig. 21. The system of banded phytoliths combines long phytoliths of the dendritic type (G5) with short cell phytoliths (G1) (Runge, 1999). All are under side view. This orientation of the phytoliths suggests that we view them through a section of the original plant organ, an orientation that can only be explained if the original material lied on a surface. PPL,  $400\times$

The layer has been interpreted as the remains of a floor. The presence of phosphorus crusts, in combination with the presence of continuous lines of phytoliths and coprolithic material points to a stable floor. This thin layer was covered with a thick layer, composed of loam and construction waste (bricks, mortar) (US 2333).

# 6.4. The upper Dark Earth (TR 56: US 2230, US 2331, US 2337)

The upper Dark Earth horizons have a thickness of  $20 - 40\mathrm{cm}$  and clear lower boundaries. In thin section, bioturbation is strongly attested, as revealed by the widespread biogenic porosity, by the presence of earthworm granules (Canti, 2003) and by numerous, often intersecting, crescent infillings. The groundmass is usually slightly calcareous. Large quantities of finely comminuted  $(< 50\mu \mathrm{m})$  organic punctuations, charred vegetal fragments and charcoal particles are dispersed in it, giving rise to the characteristic dark colour.

One of their main features is the presence of abundant archaeological materials. Fragments of brick, mortar and pottery, eggshell, burnt and unburnt bone and fishbone, vitrified phytoliths, carnivore/omnivore excrements, autofluorescent under blue light (Fig. 22; see Macphail and Goldberg, 2010) are scattered randomly within the samples. The very high frequency of charred grains (some of which derive from crops) is striking in all analyzed upper Dark Earth horizons. These occur as single scattered grains or within allochthonous angular to sub-rounded aggregates of  $1-2\mathrm{mm}$  in diameter (Figs. 23 and 24). Beside the charred grains, such aggregates contain quartz silt and charcoal, all embedded in a colourless optically isotropic mass, possibly of siliceous nature. Occasional adjoining fine earth displays traces of rubefaction due to exposure to fire. These features possibly suggest that these materials derive from the activity of domestic hearths, where the accidental or voluntary burning of cereal plant residues (grains, chaff etc.) took place. In one case, phytoliths were discernible with certainty within the siliceous homogeneous mass of these aggregates. The presence of metallurgical slags is most likely correlated with the higher concentrations of heavy minerals recorded in the upper Dark Earth (e.g. Units 2230, 2231, 2337 in Trench 56; see Table 6) with respect to both overlying backfill units (e.g. US 2336) and lower Dark Earths. Scattered reworked Bt horizon fragments in the lower Dark Earth derives most likely to the digging of structures cutting through the natural substrata of the Brussels plateau. These

units appear to be very poor in phytoliths with a clear dominance of isolated phytoliths (Fig. 5) deriving from grasses.

The presence in the soil of a mixture of faecal material and waste from domestic activities such as food preparation and hearth rakeout and metal working residues, can be interpreted as an indicator of manuring, aimed at improving the chemical fertility of the local sandy soils. This is confirmed not only by the enhanced levels of organic carbon and organic phosphorus in the Dark Earth unit with respect to the units of backfill occurring above and below them (see Table 6) but also by the presence of articulated phytoliths typical for crops within dung material (Fig. 8). These practices of waste management are commonly encountered in European urban and proto-urban agricultural contexts (see Davidson et al., 2006; Goldberg and Macphail, 2006: 271–275; Devos et al., 2007; Nicosia et al., 2012).

The interpretation of the upper Dark Earth horizons as agricultural soils is also derived from the presence of abundant dusty clay textural pedofeatures. These occur both within Dark Earths as well as in the layers below them, whether natural subsoil horizons

or human-laid backfill units. Textural pedofeatures comprise low-birefringence dusty clay coatings and infillings in the pore space (packing voids and biogenic pores), intercalations and thin  $(< 10\mu \mathrm{m})$  coatings of dusty clay around sand grains (Fig. 25). This latter occurrence gives rise to a chitonic coarse/fine related distribution pattern.

The resulting picture is that the upper Dark Earth horizons can be interpreted as human-made agricultural soils. The agricultural practices involved in their formation entail manuring with a mixture of domestic waste, artisan activity by-products and faecal material, possibly coupled with tillage (see Lewis, 1999). Most of the direct markers for cultivated crops (Avenida sp. and potentially Hordeum sp.) being recorded within dung material can be viewed as intrusive material. Another origin for cultivated crop phytoliths is the addition of residues from domestic hearths, witnessed also by the presence of charred grains. This piece of evidence does not suggest that these activities were carried out to cultivate crop fields.

We cannot identify the type of implements adopted, but the observed textural pedofeatures suggest bare and loosened soil surfaces. These allowed for surface slaking and for the downward infiltration of a mixture of clay, silt and organic particles (see Courty et al., 1989: 130-133; Macphail et al., 1990; Macphail, 1998).

The human-made agricultural soils that have been identified at the site are compatible with manured and probably tilled "garden soils", mentioned for the Court of Hoogstraeten by historical sources. In garden soils, the addition of domestic waste to enhance the nutrient status of the soil is regarded as a common practice (see Currie, 2005).

The phytolith record of these upper Dark Earths is limited to grasses, and does not fit with identification as "garden soils". Analyses of seeds performed in another 14th-15th century AD Brussels site (Petite Rue de Bouchers) document the occurrence of several taxa typical for gardens, among which Betulaceae (Corylus); Rosaceae (Prunus, Pyrus, Rubus, Mesilus) Juglandaceae (Juglans). Urtica dioica has also been reported (Van der Valk, 2010, 2011; Speleers, 2012a, 2012b). Such plant taxa are known for accumulating some distinctive phytoliths within their leaves (Vrydaghs, 2003). As such, the absence of evidence for plant taxa other than grasses is intriguing.

One possible explanation is that leaf material form these taxa were systematically removed before decomposition of the tissues, thus explaining the absence of phytoliths. An alternative

explanation for their absence is that Dicotyledon phytoliths seem to be more fragile than Monocotyledon phytoliths (personal communication Akos Peto, Hungarian National Museum).

Inherent limitations of the technique cannot be excluded. However, the phytolith study of thin sections from Dark Earth sequences of other sites, e.g. Burchtsite, Antwerpen (see Devos et al., 2013) and Strasbourg (Nicosia et al., 2013) records different associations of morphological classes. As such, the phytolith analysis of thin sections appears not to be limited to the record of a grass signature. Meanwhile, taking into account the rather poor abundance of phytoliths deriving from taxa known as important phytolith accumulators and the lack of agreement between the phytolith signature and the other proxies pointing to gardening activities, the phytolith record for these upper layers remains so far unsatisfyingly unexplained.

# 6.5. Archaeological interest

The integrated study of the Dark Earth on the site of the Court of Hoogstraeten demonstrated that various processes and agents are involved in its formation and transformation.

The study of the lower Dark Earth established the following chronological sequence. In a first phase preceding the 10th-12th century, grassland has possibly been used for pasturing. In the 10th-12th century, this surface was transformed into a crop field with the cultivation of oats (Avena sp.) and other crops. As this activity took place on a surface that was previously under grassland, it might be suggested that new land was taken into agriculture, as has been established on several spots within the centre of town (see Devos et al., 2011a). The study suggests thus rather long-lasting and continuous agricultural activities around the 10th-12th centuries on the Coudenberg, which became an important seat of power with the construction of the Palace of the Dukes in the 12th century. As such, this study indicates the early urbanization of Brussels, a period historically still poorly documented (Degraeve et al., 2010).

The fine microstratified black units have been identified as the burnt remains of a floor, possibly of a stable. Interestingly, this layer shows almost no traces of bioturbation, suggesting rapid burial.

For the upper Dark Earth (16th century), intensive soil loosening and reworking and enrichment with domestic and artisan waste has been observed, probably relating to the historically documented garden of the Court of Hoogstraeten. The large quantities of waste observed within the Dark Earth suggest the existence of practices of middening and waste management. The lack of phytoliths which could indicate the presence of a garden remains problematic. However, micromorphology showed that the material in the upper Dark Earth is almost exclusively in secondary stratigraphic position, being issued from dumping and reworking. Therefore, the signal deriving from the activities carried out in the parcel and of its vegetal cover is possibly strongly "diluted" within abundant allochthonous materials.

The comparison between the upper and the lower Dark Earth shows clearly that formation processes and activities differ significantly. As such, it is important to stress that an ubiquitous interpretation of "Dark Earth" does not exist, and that each Dark Earth should be investigated individually.

# 7. Conclusions

The integration of archaeology, archaeopedology and a phytolith study, has proven to be a useful tool for the understanding of the formation of Dark Earth on the site of the Court of Hoogstraeten. It allowed the identification of various human activities and natural processes involved in its formation. The method was also quite successful in confirming the presence of a floor layer.

The phytolith analysis of thin section brings into evidence differences in the phytolith content between stratigraphical units, either in terms of general abundance, relative frequencies of distribution patterns or spectra composition, thus contributing to a better understanding of their history. Whereas the micromorphological approach of the phytolith study of the lower Dark Earth enabled identification of several crops that have probably been grown in situ, identification of plant taxa indicating unambiguously practices of gardening could not be made for the upper Dark Earth. Micromorphology was useful in identifying the traces of middening and of surface loosening and disruption that suggest an interpretation as garden soils. However, due to lack of macroscopic markers, it was not possible for micromorphology alone to identify the type(s) of agricultural implement(s) employed. The strong reworking and the repeated addition of materials to the soil, as a result of manuring, seem to hamper the degree of visibility of the archaeobotanical evidence of the primary use of the area.
