# Abstract

Tongeren is the only Roman administrative capital within the borders of present-day Belgium. It developed in the first century A.D. and became an important civitas. Many excavations in the center of town have uncovered complex stratigraphic sequences, including dark earths, dating to Roman as well as early medieval times. Their interpretation, based on traditional archaeological methods, often remains problematic. A large-scale excavation at Vermeulenstraat in 2014 is the first occasion where a geoarchaeological study was conducted using both micromorphology and the study of phytoliths in thin sections. The aim was to evaluate the impact of depositional and post-depositional processes, to gain an understanding of the formation of the dark earths encountered on the site, to characterize the deposits between and underneath them, and to identify and differentiate human activities and natural phenomena. The results show a range of different activities and events, such as cultivation, construction (including floor preparation), destruction, waste dumping, and gardening. Their different formation histories illustrate the evolution of the area, and their analysis provides an important precedent for the further geoarchaeological study of this town.

# 1 | INTRODUCTION

Originally developed as a military settlement at the end of the first century B.C., Tongeren (Atuatuca Tungrorum) became an important Gallo-Roman town along the road between Cologne and Bavay. Many excavations in the center of the town have unearthed stratigraphic sequences of occupation dating to Roman and high medieval times. The period between the late 4th and 11th centuries, however, remains more elusive because it is typically represented by dark earths, which are thick, dark-colored, and seemingly homogenized units that were in the past often regarded as single deposits and removed without further study. However, these sequences are of

particular interest in Tongeren. As in many European towns, without them the transition between archaeological strata of late antique date and those of the High Medieval Period remains poorly understood. Moreover, the fact that dark earths have been encountered and have remained uninterpreted on sites predating late antiquity suggests that the formation history of even the better known, Roman sequences in this town's development is not yet fully understood. The units studied here thus constitute a unique opportunity to investigate the older parts of the town's development.

The urban remains encountered in Tongeren are not limited to buildings, street remains and other archaeological structures. An important part of the record is composed of soils and sediment

deposits. These encompass well-defined, sometimes microlaminated strata, and so-called urban dark earths. The latter are thick, dark-colored homogeneous units covering large areas. Initially, this term was only used to designate those units separating archaeological deposits of antique and high medieval age (Cammas, Champagne, David, Desachy, & Guyard, 1995; Galinie, 2004; Macphail, Galinie, & Verhaeghe, 2003; Macphail, Hall & Kenward, 1994). More recently, the definition has been extended to include all urban thick, dark-colored, humic, homogeneous units that cover larger surfaces. They are often rich in anthropogenic remains (charcoal, ceramic, brick, bone, mortar, coprolites, slag, etc.) and their designation is independent of chronological constraints or geographical location (see e.g., Nicosia & Devos, 2014; Nicosia, Devos, Macphail, Nicosia & Stoops, 2017). At present, the term "urban dark earth" is used solely for descriptive purposes and is replaced by a functional or genetic interpretation after analysis (Fondrillon, 2009).

Dark earths have increasingly been recorded in many locations throughout the town of Tongeren over the last two decades (see Table 1 and Figure 2). However, they have rarely been subjected to detailed study. No detailed geoarchaeological or micromorphological research has taken place until present. In the rare cases where dark earths were previously examined (Ervynck, Vandevorst, & Oomen, 2014, pp. 85-89), the analysis comprised a study of the material from sieved deposits that had been removed in spits. This practice is problematic because it disregards any stratigraphy still present in the dark earths, which may be difficult to notice with the naked eye. It also means that the sieved samples are likely to contain mixed material from different contexts. Additionally, in early studies, no attention was paid to post-depositional processes that may have affected the contexts in question. This has important implications for the way in which such layers are interpreted.

Tongeren's ubiquitous dark earths have in the past often been characterized as a single deposit, either interpreted as a levelling layer to raise the surface, but most often as a rubble layer (Ervynck et al., 2014; Vanderhoeven & Vynckier, 2008; Vanderhoeven, Vynckier, & Vynckier, 1991). More recently, it has been interpreted as a dump of recycled Roman waste material brought in from a large midden and spread for small-scale cultivation or gardening in the fifth or possibly sixth century A.D. (Ervynck et al., 2014, p. 87). Whereas an open space for cultivation is a valid hypothesis, some aspects remain problematic. The question is whether material was really brought in from an old, large waste ground. Local dumping of household waste in backyards also seems a possibility. Additionally, it is highly unlikely that the dark earth had the same origin and character in all locations. The fact that they span such a large urban area suggests the contrary: that different origins and uses are represented by a seemingly uniform unit. Indeed, previous research has clearly shown that the dark earths of a single town can have strongly varying depositional histories and are the result of different activities, as demonstrated, for example, in Brussels (Devos, Nicosia, Vrydaghs et al., 2017; Devos, Vrydaghs, Degraeve, & Modrie, 2011) or London (Macphail, Hall & Kenward, 1994). Thus, multiple locations should ideally be analysed to produce relevant data. Considering the fact that dark earths are so commonly present in

Tongeren, it is impossible to understand the town's evolution without their detailed analysis.

At the site Vermeulenstraße (Phase 4; Figures 1 and 2, no. 37), excavated in 2014, the micromorphological study served to investigate the formation history of the urban stratigraphy, including three dark earth deposits. The study consisted of gaining an understanding of the formation of the individual units (e.g., investigating whether they formed in situ or were deposited gradually or abruptly, etc.), detecting discontinuities and truncations, as well as evaluating post-depositional processes. The ultimate goal was to identify which activities and events, anthropogenic and/or natural, were responsible for the creation of the urban stratigraphy on the site and to map their evolution through time.

Whereas micromorphology has become an established method in the study of urban dark earths, its integration with phytolith studies is still rare in this field. Especially in contexts where other botanical remains (pollen, plant macro-remains) are poorly preserved, as is the case in Tongeren, the study of phytoliths in soil thin section is crucial as it provides an additional tool for the identification of plant remains. The integration of the study of phytoliths within a micromorphological study generates a more accurate understanding of their taphonomy and function (i.e., see Devos, Nicosia, Vrydaghs, & Modrie, 2013; Devos, Wouters, Vrydaghs, et al., 2013; Vrydaghs, Ball, & Devos, 2016; Vrydaghs, Devos, & Petö, 2017; Vrydaghs & Devos, 2018b; Wouters, Devos, Milek, et al., 2017).

# 2 | SITE LOCATION AND HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

The site is located in the present town center (Figures 1 and 2) and is marked as "built area" (OB) on the Belgian soil map, hence no detailed information on local soil development is available. The elevation of the site is approximately  $104\mathrm{m}$  above sea level (Figure 1). The quaternary deposits in this region are between 4 and  $10\mathrm{m}$  thick (Verstraelen, Gullentops, Paulissen, & Vandenberghe, 2000). In the region surrounding Tongeren, they are predominantly characterized by loess (loam) deposited during the Pleni and Late Glacial on top of tertiary marine sediments. Tongeren itself, however, is located on a border between loess deposits to the south, and sand deposits to the north. On the site Vermeulenstraße, Weichselian windblown sandy deposits overlie the tertiary sediments (Verstraelen et al., 2000, p. 29).

Tongeren's history as a Gallo-Roman urban center from the late first century B.C. is archaeologically relatively well known. It was founded as Atuatuca Tungrorum, the capital of the Civitas Tungrorum, part of the province Gallia Belgica. The earliest traces consist of an initially military settlement with a palisade and houses constructed in wood and daub laid out along a regular grid (Celis, Reygel, & Wesemael, 2014; Vanderhoeven et al., 1991; Vanvinckenroye, 1975). From the first century A.D. onward, the town expanded and more elaborate houses, as well as thermae, warehouses, temples, and an aqueduct were built. Two stone ramparts, dated, respectively, to the second and fourth centuries, were constructed surrounding the town (Figures 1 and 2). The first rampart encompassed a larger area compared with the second, which was built when the town

had already diminished in size (Vanvinckenroye, 1975, pp. 46-52 and 63-67). From the fourth century onward, Christianity is attested by the presence of an episcopal see and Christian graves in several cemeteries in the town, as well as underneath the current basilica of Our Lady (Ervynck et al., 2014; Van Rechem, 2003; De Winter, Vanderhoeven, & Ervynck, 2018), the latter with graves dating to the Merovingian period (ca. A.D. 450-750) onward. In Late Antiquity, the town was the bishop's seat (fourth century A.D.), but after its move to nearby Maastricht, connected with the move of the relics of the bishop St. Servatius, much less is known about the town (Theuws, 2003).

The areas within both Roman town ramparts in particular have been the subject of excavations in the past. Medieval traces from the 12th and especially the 13th century onward are routinely found at archaeological sites in Tongeren. The period between the late 4th and 10th century, however, remains almost completely unknown. It is unclear if, and in what form, the town survived and scholars have argued for its decay during this time (Verhoeven, 2012). Archaeological finds dating to this period are scarce apart from the excavation within the basilica. These uncovered traces of its Late Roman until Romanesque predecessors, including phases dating to

the Ottonian (10th to early 11th century), Carolingian (late eighth to ninth century A.D.), and Merovingian Period (mid-fifth to mid eighth century). The so-called "St-Maternus chapel," a circular building adjacent to the basilica that was demolished in the early 19th century, may well have been the early medieval baptisterium (Ervynck et al., 2014, pp. 67-72; Van Rechem, 2003, p. 11). Otherwise, no structural traces and only very few single finds have been made dating to the Early Medieval Period, including a Frankish hairpin found in the dark earth of the site by the Astridlaan (Celis et al., 2014, p. 25),  $\sim$ 800 m southwest of Vermeulenstraat (Figure 2, no. 2). Evidence suggests that only the part of town around the basilica remained in use continuously, whereas other areas probably went out of use immediately after the Late Roman Period. However, additional research, especially focusing on the dark earths in targeted locations of the town, is needed to confirm this hypothesis.

Vermeulenstraße (Phase 4) lies in the northern part of the town and is located within both Roman town ramparts, although the

fourth-century rampart runs through the excavation area. Three separate dark earths were observed (Figure 3), spanning the entire Roman Period. The upper dark earth was a possible contender for an early medieval date, since it had been truncated and covered by the foundation of a 13th century tithe barn. However, finds such as coins and pottery fragments place the third dark earth in the Late Roman period, probably between the last quarter of the third and end of the fourth or early fifth century. The youngest coin that could be dated was minted between A.D. 388 and 395.

Soil micromorphology, combined with a phytolith study on thin sections, was applied to evaluate the impact of the general depositional and post-depositional processes, to characterize the deposits between and underneath the three dark earths, to

improve our understanding of the dark earth formation processes, and to identify and differentiate human activities and natural phenomena.

# 3.1 | Field study

Field descriptions were made according to the "Comprehensive Field Data Bases" (Langohr, 1994) and the "Guidelines for soil profile description" (FAO, 2006; Table 2). Fourteen undisturbed oriented blocks were collected from the soil profile (Figure 2) for micromorphological and phytolith analysis. They were selected according to the sampling rationale described in Nicosia, Devos, and Macphail (2017).

# 3.2 Micromorphology

The air-dried undisturbed blocks were impregnated with resin and manufactured into thin sections (thickness  $\sim 30\mu m$ ) by the Laboratory for Mineralogy and Petrography, Ghent University, according to the guidelines by Benyarku, Stoops, and de Lleida (2005). The thin sections were scanned under normal light and under crossed polarizers (XPL) using a flatbed scanner following Arpin, Mallol, and Goldberg (2002). Observations were made with petrological microscopes under plane-polarized light (PPL), under crossed polarizers (XPL), and oblique incident light (OIL) at magnifications of 25, 100, 200, 400, 500, and 1,000. Additionally, several features were scanned under ultra violet (UV) and blue fluorescent light at  $\times 400$ . The thin section descriptions follow the international nomenclature of the "Guidelines for Analysis and Description of Soil and Regolith Thin

Sections" (Stoops, 2003). This analysis also includes the seminumerical quantification of certain features and components.

# 3.3 | Phytolith study of the dark earth units

The phytolith analysis of thin sections follows Devos, Wouters, et al. (2013), Vrydaghs et al. (2016), and Vrydaghs and Devos (2018a). It took place after the micromorphological study and consisted of several microscopy sessions with the micromorphologists. Based on these observations 15 squares of  $5 \times 5 \mathrm{~mm}$  were selected in each studied unit. Within each square, four fields of  $0.2 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$  were systematically analysed under PPL and XPL at a magnification of  $\times 400$ . This selection served to target the phytolith content of the soil matrix and to avoid compiling these phytoliths with those with other depositional histories (e.g., phytoliths within pottery, coprolites, etc.). In addition, the phytolith content of selected archaeological inclusions (e.g., coprolites, ash remains, and pottery) visible in thin section was also determined.

The phytolith analysis consisted of a five-step approach:

1. The systematic recording of the distribution patterns of the phytoliths (isolated, clustered, and articulated; for definitions, see Vrydaghs et al., 2016; Vrydaghs, Devos, & Petö, 2017).  
2. The description of visibility, preservation, and color of the individual phytoliths following Vrydaghs and Devos (2018a).  
3. Their morphotypical analysis, that is, the inventory of the phytoliths within each distribution pattern. The morphotypical analyses were carried out according to a revised version of Runge's

# 4.1 | The dark earth layers

On top of a unit essentially composed of sand sized quartz (SU 1), the first level of dark earth was observed (SU 2 and 15). The thickness of SU 15 is around  $15\mathrm{cm}$ , whereas only a few centimetres are preserved in the location of SU 2. This deposit is characterized by the mixing in of sands, with more silty sediments. Considering their mineralogical and textural similarity, the sands probably originate from the underlying layer. This mixing/homogenization is confirmed by the random and unoriented distribution of anthropogenic remains (see below). Humus enrichment (Figure 5a), strong biological activity (earthworm and roots galleries) suggest the development of an ancient topsoil (Gerasimova & Lebedeva-Verba, 2010). The numerous dusty clay and clay silt coatings (Figure 5b) may indicate a temporarily bare and/or disturbed surface (Déak et al., 2017). The presence of implement marks reveals its reworking using tools (see Goldberg & Macphail, 2006; Lewis, 2012). The combined presence of (rare) secondary phosphatic features (e.g., phosphatic infillings and coatings along pores, vivianite nodules) (Figure 5c), coprolites and domestic (kitchen) waste, such as bone fragments (Figure 5g), pottery (Figure 5h), charcoal (Figure 5e), vitrified ash (e.g., molten phytoliths), also suggests the addition of

manure (see e.g., Devos, Nicosia, et al., 2013). The observed dense, rounded silty clay aggregates (Figure 5f) are probably fragments of earthen-based construction materials (see e.g., Devos, Vrydaghs, Degraeve, & Fechner, 2009). The enrichment of the soil is further supported by an anomalously high concentration of mesofaunal activity in an initially poor sandy soil (see Goldberg & Macphail, 2006, p. 206). All these elements together suggest that this first dark layer was the result of tillage and soil enrichment.

The phytolith assemblage of the matrix of this unit (SU 15) is composed of isolated, clustered, and articulated phytoliths. Phytoliths derived from grasses are the most common in the assemblages of each of these distribution patterns. Notably, the articulated assemblages include phytoliths known as dendritics (ICPN Working Group: Madella, Alexandre, & Ball, 2005; Figure 5d), typically produced by cultivated crops (T. B. Ball, Ehlers, & Standing, 2009). Their articulated distribution implies that inflorescence bracts from cereals decomposed in situ. Taking into account that these articulated dendritics are not associated with excrements (see Table 4) or excremental waste, nor to fireplace rake-out, cereal processing waste, or any post-depositional perturbation (biogalleries, etc.), it is highly probable that they are derived from locally cultivated plants. Of the 13 analysed systems, three provided enough wave lobes to perform a full morphometric analysis. The morphometric analysis of the range of means of these articulated dendritics indicates that System 8 likely did not derive from Triticum dicoccoides, Triticum dicoccon, Triticum durum, or Hordeum vulgare, while System 10 likely did not derive from  $T$  dicoccoides or  $T$  durum, and System 11 likely did not derive from  $H$  vulgare (Supporting Information Table 4). The nearest neighbor discriminant analysis permitted us to refine the analysis. Whereas  $40\%$  of the lobes plotted for System  $8\%$ , and  $45.16\%$  of the lobes plotted for System 10 were closest to the plot for Avena sativa lobes, it is most likely that Systems 8 and 10 were produced by A. sativa. System 11 is less clear, but it likely was not produced  $T$  dicoccoides,  $T$  dicoccon,  $T$  durum, or Secale cereale (Supporting Information Table 5).

The second dark earth (SU 4, 5, and 9), which developed on top of the remains of a silty building floor (SU 3 and 8), presents similar characteristics (Figure 6a,b). The main difference is an increased quantity and diversity of anthropogenic remains. Apart from domestic remains (bone, charcoal and pottery; Figure 6g), materials from construction and/or destruction are relatively abundant in this dark earth. Limestone (Figure 6f), mortar, and multiple fragments of earthen-based construction remains such as dense silty clay fragments originating from daub floors or walls were found. These construction remains probably originate from the ruins of a previous structure that was incorporated within the dark earth.

The presence of more abundant phosphatic features and excrements (Figure 6c-e) suggests a more intense manuring of the soil than was the case in Dark Earth 1 (SU 2 and 15). Again, this combination of evidence indicates tillage of the soil. Orthic iron nodules (Figure 6h) and ferruginised tissue fragments point to incipient hydromorphic conditions (Stoops & Eswaran, 1985). These are probably related to the presence of a dense floor layer below (see Section 4.4) that hampered sufficiently quick water infiltration.

The anomalous thickness of the units ( $>10\mathrm{cm}$ ) can be explained by the high biological activity that gradually destroyed the ancient building remains. This phenomenon has been frequently reported in other towns in UK, France, and Italy (Borderie, 2011; Macphail, Hall & Kenward, 1994; Nicosia, 2018). Here, it occurred in combination with a steady accumulation of manure and domestic waste. An additional input of colluvium, though not firmly attested, cannot be excluded. The importance of the latter has been recognized on a series of dark earths in Brussels (Devos et al., 2009, 2017).

As in the previous dark earth, the phytolith assemblage of the matrix is composed of isolated, clustered, and articulated phytoliths, with each of these patterns dominated by phytoliths derived from grasses (Supporting Information Table 2). Here, the articulated assemblages are composed solely of phytoliths derived from cultivated crops (dendritics; ICPN Working Group: Madella, Alexandre, & Ball, 2005). Again, these articulated systems are not associated with excremental waste, fireplace rake-out, or any

post-depositional perturbation (biogalleries, etc.). Consequently, they are interpreted as coming from locally cultivated plants. Unfortunately, the observed articulated systems were not of sufficient size for morphometric analyses.

The third dark earth (SU 12 and 13) also presents the characteristics of an ancient topsoil that was affected by soil working. However, it stands out due to an abundance of anthropogenic remains. In addition to domestic residues (bone fragments, pottery, charcoal, etc.) and construction/destruction debris (limestone, mortar, and fragments of earthen-based construction remains; 8A), artisanal waste (metallurgical slag; 8B) and manure (phosphatic features and excrements; 8C) occur as well. The metal working waste was identified as lead and iron (identifications verified using micro X-ray fluorescence spectrometry [μXRF] according to the method described by Wouters, Makarona, Nys, & Claeys, 2017). This richness, together with the anomalous thickness of the layer ( $>40$  cm), indicates a significant accumulation of material. The homogeneous character of the dark earth shows that the rate of

accumulation was slower than the time needed for complete homogenization. A gradual, relatively slow and continuous accumulation thus seems probable. The origins of the sedimentary materials are, as in the previous dark earth, diverse. A part of these stems from disintegrating earthen-based building materials (as also suggested by the underlying arrested dark earth, see Section 4.2). Manure and household waste are other potential contributors of sediment. Finally, the accumulation of colluvium, although again not firmly attested, cannot be excluded. In this case, the abundance of implement marks and anthropogenic remains, indicates that the soil was significantly more intensely worked compared with previous phases.

Compared to Dark Earths 1 and 2, the phytolith assemblage in this layer is characterized by a much more marked occurrence of physically altered phytoliths (Figure 4b). Additionally, despite their presence, dendritics were not observed in articulated patterns but only in isolated and clustered patterns (Supporting Information Table 2). Taking into account the widespread occurrence of articulated dendritics within other units (SU 2, 5, and 15), this absence is not deemed incidental or

related to insufficient observations. Rather, it is the result of their depositional and/or post-depositional history. Either their disarticulation is the result of important post-depositional reworking (which can account for the physical alteration), or the phytoliths are in secondary position and the result of dumping domestic waste that contained decomposed plant material (Devos, Nicosia, et al., 2013).

The fact that the phytolith record is limited to grasses is intriguing and does not necessarily correlate with its identification as a garden/ backyard. A comparable spectrum has, however, also been observed for a historically documented garden layer (Devos, Nicosia, et al., 2013) and a backyard/garden deposit (Devos et al., 2017) in Brussels. However, hay could have been added to the surface as part of other activities (see Section 5). In addition, the combined use as a garden or backyard with small-scale (vegetable/herb) cultivation, involving a more intense physical reworking of the soil, could explain the absence of articulated cereal phytoliths. This is consistent with the interpretation of secondary (domestic) waste as opposed to in situ crop cultivation (Devos, Nicosia, et al., 2013), and the marked presence of

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/27c1be73-4354-491a-a072-101a265b7422/e8f9e810585c987e522fe69eb9bedc871cd7a42057f42bb1e8e7857d95e27632.jpg)  
FIGURE 7 Thin section scan of the boundary between Units 10 and 11 showing incipient dark earth formation. The image shows how bioturbation progressively affected the floor preparation layer in the lower unit. However, the accumulation of new material suddenly exceeded the speed of homogenization so that the unit's transformation into a fully developed, homogenized dark earth was not completed (TS 14) [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]

physically altered phytoliths. The growing of vegetables would not necessarily have left a phytolith signature and may have taken place here. Some vegetables, especially legumes and cucurbits, do produce phytoliths, though they are of different morphotypes and not as abundantly produced as in cereals. They also do not preserve in soil as well as cereal phytoliths do. Thus, it is common to find none of these phytolith remains in vegetable gardens.

# 4.2 | Incipient dark earth formation

Incipient, or arrested, dark earths occur when the accumulation of new material suddenly exceeds the speed of homogenization (see also Cremaschi & Nicosia, 2010). This process is the opposite of that which affected for example Dark Earth 3, where the accumulation rate was slow enough to enable the full homogenization of the dark earth.

Incipient dark earth formation has been observed in Units 10 and 11. Unit 10 is very similar to the anthropogenically deposited house floor preparation layers ("passive zone" sensu Gé, Courty, Matthews et al., 1993) encountered in Units 3 and 8 (see Section 4.4). Due to heavy bioturbation, Unit 10 can only be recognized in

patches and aggregates strongly mixed with the fabric of Unit 11. Its upper boundary is highly diffuse (Figure 7). The fabric of Unit 11 is only somewhat coarser and moderately sorted. It contains more fine material and a greater concentration of charcoal and humus. The high level of bioturbation of this unit is attested by passage features, channels, organomineral excremental pedofeatures and (broken) calcitic earthworm granules. In this case, mixing is the dominant formation process, but relatively rapid burial has produced the so-called "arrested dark earth" (Macphail, 2010), as the two units had not been sufficiently homogenized to erase the differences between aggregates before being buried underneath Dark Earth 3.

# 4.3 | A burning event

In one of the locations (eastern part of the section), the oldest dark earth is covered by a 4-5-cm-thick layer of burned material (US 16). It is composed of reddened soil aggregates, discontinuous lenses of mainly clustered and articulated, almost all altered, phytoliths, locally situated within a kind of silica gel (Figure 9c; see Devos et al., 2009), charcoal (often fragmented in situ), charred cereal grains, burnt and calcined bone, burnt eggshell, blackened phytoliths (Figure 9e; Vrydaghs et al., 2017), and minute ash remains. Within the burned material a type of large druses ( $\sim 50\mu \mathrm{m}$ ) is observed. These crystals are the result of burnt calcium (Durand et al. (2010)). Smaller spherulites ( $\sim 10 - 20\mu \mathrm{m}$ ) that present clearer extinction crosses are likely derived from plants (Canti, 2003), as their size, shape, and surrounding fabric do not suggest a fecal origin.

The intensive bioturbation, as witnessed by numerous galleries (Figure 9a,b) and fecal pellets, makes it difficult to distinguish between an intact fire combustion feature and a secondary deposition. However, the (discontinuous) preservation of more or less horizontally layered lenses of charcoal, articulated calcareous ashes and lenses of almost articulated phytoliths suggest in situ burning (Figure 9a,b,d; Mallol, Mentzer, & Miller, 2017). Further evidence is the reddening of the soil aggregates at the lower contact zone (Aldeias, Dibble, Sandgathe, Goldberg, & McPherron, 2007). The combination of heated grass phytoliths and charcoal/calcareous ash indicates that both herbaceous plants and wood were burnt. The charcoal fragments are not as abundant as one would expect, so that herbaceous plants were likely the dominant source of ash. The presence of numerous fragments of phytolith slag (Figure 9f) indicates that high temperatures were reached (e.g.,  $850 - 1,700^{\circ}C$  according to the alkali fluxes; Mallol et al., 2017).

The charred grains, bone, eggshell, and plant-derived calcium oxalate druses suggest food preparation. The morphometric analysis of the range of means of the articulated dendritics of System 14 is not conclusive, but the nearest neighbor discriminant analysis indicates that  $78.85\%$  of the lobes were closest to the plot for A. Sativa lobes (Supporting Information Table 5). It is thus most likely that this system was produced by A. Sativa.

# 4.4 | Preparation of indoor surfaces

The abrupt boundary between SU 3 and the underlying truncated Dark Earth 1 indicates a lithological discontinuity and suggests that new sediment was intentionally deposited. The interpretation of a discontinuity is supported by a change in fabric, mineral size, and inclusions. The texture is predominantly silty, with some horizontal lenses of coarser material (fine to medium sand). In this context, the paucity of anthropogenic inclusions, the well sorted mineral fraction, and the horizontal bands of fine sand suggest that this material was deliberately deposited by humans.

The matrix is very "clean" and does not exhibit the platy microstructure characteristic of trampled floors (Figure 8d; Milek, 2012). This indicates that the unit probably corresponds to the lowest part (preparation layer) of an indoor, constructed floor layer (termed "passive layer" in Gé et al., 1993). Similar floor layers were found in Units 8 and 10. They are commonly found at excavations and have been identified elsewhere in the town, such as the Vrijthof site (Reygel & Wesemael, 2011).

# 5 | ARCHAEOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE ANALYSIS

The micromorphological study has allowed us to reconstruct the evolution of the studied location through time.

Although situated within the perimeter of the city wall, the oldest phase, dated just after the military phase of the town and before ca. A.D. 50 based on stratigraphical information, corresponds to an open area used for the cultivation of cereals. The morphometric analysis of articulated dendritics suggests that, among others, A. Sativa was grown in this location. In the southern part of the section, only a small part of the topsoil is preserved due to truncation by a silty floor preparation layer. This floor indicates that the location loses its initial function and is turned into an indoor context, likely a domestic building. It represents the earliest structural evidence found on this site. Unfortunately, only the bottom part of this floor is left. Therefore, while it was possible to distinguish indoor from outdoor areas, no specific house functions could be attributed, nor could the type of building be distinguished. Generally, it is assumed that one generation of

traditional longhouses (byre-dwellings) existed in the settlement after the military foundation of Tongeren, and that they were replaced by more Romanised dwellings around A.D. 50 (Vanderhoeven, 1996, 2001). The only exception to this so far is the excavation of Sacramentstraat, where several generations of

traditional longhouses were present. The youngest of these was burnt down, allegedly during the Batavian revolt of A.D. 68/70 (Vanderhoeven, Vynckier, Lentacker et al., 2014). Evidence from previous excavations revealed similar silty floor layers in more intact houses of the entire Roman period (in this area ca. first to

fourth century A.D.). Due to its thinness and truncation the floor preparation layer found at Vermeulenstraße had not been recognized and identified as such during excavation.

In the eastern part of the section, the cultivated soil that represents Dark Earth 1 is preserved to a greater thickness. It is covered by combustion remains containing plant ashes and charcoal before the silty, dense floor preparation layer is laid down. The level of bioturbation makes it difficult to confirm the in situ character of the burning. However, the presence of burned eggshell, charred seeds, and so forth suggests that the ashes represent the remains of cooking. Consequently, there appears to be no link with the historically attested fire of A.D. 69/70 associated with the Batavian revolt.

The second dark earth overlying the truncated floor preparation layer is dated to a period between A.D. 65/70 and the middle of the second century based on the material finds, predominantly pottery. It is the result of a new phase of agricultural activities. While the cultivation of cereals is confirmed by phytolith analysis, adequate articulated systems for morphometric analysis to further identify specific plant species were not found. In a case like this, where other parts of the area contain clear evidence of a simultaneous dense, built urban fabric in the Roman Period, this may spark discussion about the place of agriculture within urbanized space (Wouters, 2016). A new preparation layer of a floor covers the second dark earth.

Again, the homogenization process of a third dark earth affects the top of this floor, this time exhibiting a more intensive use of the location. This late antique dark earth (last quarter of third to fourth or early fifth century), dated by pottery as well as coins, is interpreted as an outdoor accumulation of domestic and building waste, as well as some metal slag. The metal working waste (lead and iron, identifications verified using  $\mu$ XRF according to the method by Wouters, Makarona, Nys, et al., 2017) and significant amounts of building materials attest to a potential use as a communal open space or backyard. The accumulation probably took place in several episodes. The presence of an incipient dark earth indicates that at first, accumulation must have happened relatively rapidly, whereas a slower accumulation later on led to the development of a fully mature dark earth. This is consistent with the material evidence, which suggests a long accumulation, possibly after the last town fire in the last quarter of the third century (Vanvinckenroye, 1975). The top unit contains particularly large amounts of calcium-based building remains. A combined use as a garden or backyard with small-scale cultivation, involving more intense physical reworking of the soil is probable.

It must be noted that the term "garden" is problematic, as it may imply a very different use from how gardens are conceived at present, housing many different activities (including for instance artisanal production, waste deposition, storage space, the keeping of small animals, vegetable and herb cultivation, etc.). The term "garden deposits" is also problematic in the study of dark earths, as it has in the past been used as a generalizing, interpretive one for all dark earths of a town without further study to support this (Galinié, 2000; Wouters, 2016). In this sense, the term "backyard," or even "courtyard," seems to capture a multitude of possible activities better, without limiting it to vegetable cultivation. This appears consistent with the archaeological evidence. A house is still present

on site and undergoes repairs in the late fourth century (dated by a coin found under the floor), so activities in a courtyard at this time are plausible for this location.

The uppermost dark earth is truncated by the foundations of a high medieval tithe barn. The truncation has made it impossible to study the younger phases of early medieval settlement, if these were ever present at all in this location. It is likely that this part of the town was no longer in use after the beginning of the fifth century. At Vermeulenstraße, the next phase of use is represented by the 13th century tithe barn, along with the construction of the medieval rampart. For this rampart, stones from the fourth century rampart that crosses the terrain were reused. Very scarce medieval finds were made at this site and they are limited to a few sherds of high medieval Andenne ware, a type of glazed ware produced in the Meuse region. No medieval ditches or pits are present either. Even though this hypothesis is based on negative evidence, it is consistent with that of earlier excavations and with the theory that the town had shrunk significantly between the 6th and 10th centuries. Based on the evidence from past excavations, it seems that only the zone immediately around the basilica experiences continued activity. To better understand the Late Roman and early medieval phases of Tongeren, targeted sampling should be prioritized in the future to compare the zone around the basilica with other areas in the town. Specifically, promising locations where early medieval dark earths have been attested include the surroundings of the basilica, as well as several sites in the center around the market square (Reygel & Wesemael, 2011; Van Rechem, 2003; Wesemael, 2012).

# 6 CONCLUSIONS

In Tongeren, micromorphology has made it possible to reconstruct the evolution of a single location from the first until the fourth or possibly early fifth century A.D. Three dark earths, as well as deposits representing the built environment and a burning event, were analysed. The deposits that were initially descriptively termed urban dark earths were successfully interpreted according to their function and formation processes.

The studied sequence illustrates a succession of episodes of cultivation and domestic activity. The last phase (Dark Earth 3) attested to a rather intensive use of the space, potentially for gardening purposes, even though the use of this word is problematic when describing dark earths. This late antique dark earth represented an outdoor accumulation of domestic and building waste, including metal slag. A combined use as a garden or backyard with small-scale cultivation is probable.

This study clearly shows the potential of soil micromorphology and phytolith studies of soil thin sections for the investigation of urban stratigraphy in general, and dark earth units in particular. It once more highlights the problems posed by sieving material obtained from the excavation of dark earths using arbitrary spits. The study demonstrates that the urban dark earth formation in Tongeren is the result of different activities and events. This implies

that if we aim to understand the urban fabric, multiple locations must be analysed to produce relevant data. This has important implications for Tongeren. Considering the fact that dark earths are so ubiquitous in the town, it is impossible to understand its formation without a further detailed analysis.
