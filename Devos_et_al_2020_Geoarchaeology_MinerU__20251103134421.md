# Abstract

Geoarchaeological research in urban contexts is a relatively recent development in Belgian geoarchaeology, with pioneering studies dating back to the 1990s. In the beginning of the 21st century, a specific research protocol was developed in Brussels, and in the last years, there have been several attempts to apply a similar approach to urban contexts in Flanders and occasionally in Wallonia.

Current debates in urban geoarchaeology mainly focus on:

- The study of site stratigraphy (microstratified layers and Dark Earths)  
- The impact of urbanization on the soil  
Rivers in towns  
- Reconstruction of the ancient relief and its modifications through time  
- Soil erosion and soil protection  
- Ancient soil pollution  
- The integration of geoarchaeology with other archaeo-environmental studies (archaeobotany, archaeozooology, etc.)

Key themes for the future development of Belgian urban geoarchaeology include the in situ preservation of sites; a further integration with other methods and method development; systematic studies producing topographical insight and mapping; and synthesis work on critical issues.

# 1 | INTRODUCTION: THE PAST

Urban geoarchaeology entails the application of earth science methods and concepts (geomorphology, geology, pedology, etc.) to archaeological research carried out in urban settings (Butzer, 1982, 2008, 2011; Cammas, Borderie, Desachy, & Augry, 2011). In addition to dealing with the interactions of humans and the environment, it also encompasses the study of stratigraphy and site formation processes, and the identification of different types of activities (Karkanas & Goldberg, 2019; Macphail & Goldberg, 2018; Macphail et al., 2017; Stein & Holliday, 2017). Geoarchaeological studies in towns are

performed on different scales, ranging from the micromorphological analysis of individual stratigraphic units to the geomorphological study of the city and its surroundings. Despite the prominent position of site stratigraphy in urban archaeology—taking into consideration that urban deposits can often be several meters thick—geoarchaeological studies have only recently become a full part of urban excavations (see e.g., Goldberg & Macphail, 2006; Karkanas & Goldberg, 2019).

Belgium, and especially the northern part of the country is, together with Italy, one of the most densely urbanized areas in Europe from medieval times onward. The oldest town in the country is Tongeren (Atuatuca Tungrorum), dating back to the Gallo-Roman

period. Tournai (Tornacum) became an urban center in the 2nd century at the latest, with its administrative status of "town" given in late Roman times. Other late Roman to early medieval centers include Namur and Huy. From at least the 9th century onward there are significant urban developments in Liège, Antwerp, and Ghent. Most present-day towns, for example Bruges, Brussels, Ypres, Lier, and Leuven stem from the high medieval period (Figure 1). This rich urban landscape notwithstanding, geoarchaeological research in urban contexts is a relatively recent development in Belgium.

The main motivation for the first studies seems to be the need to understand the urban stratigraphy, characterized by its thickness and complexity as a result of many superimposed and intercutting phases of human occupation. This is demonstrated in the first geoarchaeological studies dating back to the 1990s. They primarily focused on issues of individual site stratigraphy and the identification of particular layers or features. As such, they did not give rise to more comprehensive syntheses. Examples are the study of a Dark Earth in the centre of Ghent (Ervynck et al., 1999; Stoops, Stoops, & Laleman, 2001) and a few interventions in the centre of Brussels (Degryse & Fechner, 2001; Fechner, 1997a; 1997b; 2001a; 2001b; 2001c), Namur (Fechner, 1994), and Liège (Fechner, 1996).

As archaeology became a regional matter in Belgium in the 1990s, research has since then developed along different axes in each region, being the Brussels Capital region, Flanders, and Wallonia. Hence, the overview that follows is presented by region.

# 1.1 | The Brussels capital region

From 2001 onward, a specific research protocol for the study of the urban deposits in the Brussels Capital Region has been developed

and applied in Brussels. This protocol comprises the systematic intervention of geoarchaeologists on all excavations.

In addition to the work of geoarchaeologists, historians, and archaeologists, the protocol also stipulates the expertise of a team of archaeobotanists and archaeozoologists (Devos, 2012a; Devos, Fechner, Vrydaghs, Degraeve, & Deligne, 2007a; Vannieuwenhuyze, Charruadas, Devos, & Vrydaghs, 2012; Devos, 2012; Devos & Degraeve, 2018). It involves a series of steps integrating the archaeo-environmental expertise:

- A desktop study: all existing documentation is collected, including the data from historical maps and images, geotechnical and quaternary geological maps, and the archaeological atlas.  
- Fieldwork, including a detailed stratigraphical and taphonomical study according to the "Comprehensive Field Data Bases" (Langohr, 1994) and the "Guidelines for soil profile description" (F.A.O., 2006). Adapted checklists have been developed and applied for the description of associated soil traces (Devos, 2003; Fechner, Langohr, & Devos, 2004).  
- Sampling: bulk samples and undisturbed oriented blocks for soil micromorphology, physicochemical analyses, archaeobotanical, and archaeozoological studies are collected from the available soil profiles following the guidelines of Devos (in press).  
- Laboratory analyses. These are based on the results of the field study and the questions raised. Depending on the research questions these involve the sieving and study of the large bulk samples for macrobotanical and zoological remains, the preparation and study of palynological samples, the study of soil and sediment thin sections for micromorphology and phytolith studies, as well as a series of standard physicochemical analyses on soil and sediment bulk samples. If necessary

additional analyses are performed (parasites, NPPs, C-14 dating, lipids, etc.).  
- Synthesis based on the first results and interpretations of the different specialists. Interdisciplinary discussion and synthesis study of the site, as well as on higher levels (e.g. neighborhoods, town, regional) are conducted.

Importantly, during all these steps, there is a permanent discussion among the specialists (historians, archaeologists, and archaeo-environmental specialists) to ensure optimal integration of data.

To date, ca. 50 sites within the historical center of town (Table S1) and ca. 30 in the larger region (Figure 2) have been subjected to geoarchaeological interventions. Beyond the study of the site stratigraphy and site formation processes (taphonomy), these have allowed for the identification of a series of natural events (colluviation, inundation, etc.) and human activities including pastoral, agricultural, construction, merchant, and artisanal activities within the centre of Brussels (Devos et. al., 2007a; Devos, Vrydaghs, Laurent, Degraeve, & Modrie, 2007b; Devos, Vrydaghs, Degraeve, & Fechner, 2009; Devos, Vrydaghs, Degraeve, & Modrie, 2011; Devos et. al., 2013a; Devos et. al., 2017a; Devos, 2019a). The wealth of data obtained in this way has enabled geoarchaeologists to address a series of questions for the first time. Due to a lack of reliable written sources, the origins of Brussels have been the subject of discussion among historians for over a century. The geoarchaeological data have demonstrated the importance of agriculture within the early development of town (Devos, 2019a; Devos & Degraeve, 2018; Devos et al., 2007b; 2011; Vannieuwenhuyze et al., 2012; Vrydaghs, Devos, Charruadas, Scott-Cummings, & Degraeve, 2016a). A second question is concerned with the spatial organization of activities. Whereas researchers can rely on a wealth of sources to study the spatial organization for the more recent periods, for the older periods, the information becomes sketchier. The oldest maps of Brussels date only back to the 16th century, and other sources discussing the internal spatial organization are rare for the earliest phases of town development (Vannieuwenhuyze, 2008). A series of maps showing the location of different activity areas for different periods of urban development could be constructed based on the geoarchaeological data (Borderie, Fondrillon, Nicosia, Devos, & Macphail, 2014; Degraeve, Demeter, Devos, Modrie, & Van Bellingen, 2010; Devos, 2019a; Devos & Degraeve, 2018). A third theme that has been addressed concerns the evolution of the physical landscape. This mainly focuses on the relief and the development of the Senne river within the urban landscape (Devos & Degraeve, 2018). A fourth theme considers the management of waste and aspects of soil pollution within the town (Devos, 2019a; 2019b). Although most geoarchaeological studies focused on the historical town center, the recent study of the evolution of the Senne valley and its regional landscape has also attempted to investigate the interaction of the town and its hinterland (Devos & Degraeve, 2018; Devos et al., 2017a; Devos, Langohr, Marinova, Nicosia, & Vrydaghs, 2017b).

# 1.2 Flanders

In Flanders, occasional geoarchaeological interventions have taken place in the last few years (Table S1). All of these were performed in a framework of developer-funded commercial archaeology, with researchers employed at universities taking on the geoarchaeological work. They include research in the centres of Antwerp (Devos et al., 2013a; Crabtree et al., 2017), Aalst (Devos, 2012b), Ghent (Mikkelsen & Devos, 2015; Stoops, De Muylder, Mikkelsen, & Vermeiren, 2016), Lier (Wouters et al., 2017) Tongeren (Wouters et al., 2019), and Ieper (Ypres; Wouters & Devos, 2017). These studies all focused on the study of site stratigraphy on individual sites, predominantly of Dark Earths (see Section 3.1). Based on the experience of the example set by Brussels, they illustrated the complex formation histories of Dark Earths as a whole. The studies also shed light on the different activities that had become invisible to the naked eye due to the seeming homogeneity of these strata. Such activities could be cultivation, the stabling of animals, the upkeep, renovation and abandonment of domestic spaces, gardening, market activities, craft working, and waste management. As these studies have typically been limited to single interventions in individual towns, they have not been the subject of overarching synthesis works.

In the past few years, extensive research into the evolution of the hydraulic landscape in the center of Ghent was conducted (Gelaude, 2019). This project also encompassed the dating of Aeolian sediments in relation to the development of the city (Van Nieuland, Vandenberghe, Gelaude, & Van den Haute, 2013).

Apart from these two types of studies, only a few other interventions have taken place to date. As such, a pedological study of the preurban soil was realized in Mechelen (Fockedey & Smeets, 2013), not taking into account the overlying anthropogenic deposits. A pedological study was also carried out on the site of "Bagattenstraße" in the center of Ghent (Langohr, 2012) and the "Keizensberg" in Leuven (Sevenants, Devroe, Langohr, Mikkelsen, & Vannieuwenhuyze, 2010).

# 1.3 Wallonia

In Wallonia, occasional interventions have been performed in Huy (Péters & Collette, 2011), Nivelles (Collette et al., 2011), Namur (Plumier, Tilmant, Collette, Pirson, & Hanut, 2012), Tournai (Collette, Ingels, Pècheur, & Sornasse, 2012), and Mons (Table S1). These studies mainly focused on local topography and geology and did not include profound geoarchaeological investigations regarding site stratigraphy and taphonomy. One exception is the micromorphological study of a Dark Earth in Mons, again based on the experience gained in Brussels, demonstrating the urban development of a neighborhood in the lower part of town (Devos, Collette, & Loicq, 2016).

This section demonstrates that while in Brussels geoarchaeology has been implemented during all urban archaeological interventions since 2001, this is not at all the case in the other parts of the country. Whereas in Flanders the number of urban geoarchaeological studies is steadily on the rise, such interventions remain scarce in Wallonia.

# 2 | THE PRESENT: KEY ISSUES AND CURRENT DEBATES

The studies that have taken place in the past decade, as well as the analyses performed today, are characterized by a number of prominent themes and debates. We have identified seven key topics that have dominated urban geoarchaeology in Belgium in recent years and which remain relevant to current scholarship. These themes cover basic issues of site stratification, physical aspects such as topography and hydrology, urban soils, erosion, and pollution. Finally, the importance of integrated research is highlighted.

# 2.1 | Urban stratigraphy and dark earths

In Belgian urban contexts, attention is increasingly drawn to two main types of deposits: Dark Earths and microstratified layers (Figures 3 and 4). Numerous studies demonstrate indeed that geoarchaeology is a particularly powerful tool to study this type of stratigraphy (Borderie, 2011; Cammas et al., 2011; Cremaschi & Nicosia, 2010; Goldberg & Macphail, 2006; Karkanas & Goldberg, 2019; Macphail, 1994; Macphail & Cruise, 2000; Nicosia, Devos, & Borderie, 2013; Wouters, 2016).

Traditionally, Dark Earths were defined as the uniform dark colored units that occur between stratified antique and modern age

deposits in towns (Cammas, Champagne, David, Desachy, & Guyard, 1995; Galinié, 2004; Macphail, 1994; Macphail, Galinié, & Verhaeghe, 2003). This traditional qualification has certainly proven its merits by drawing attention to an important component of many European towns, in the past often considered to be of no archaeological interest (David, Cammas, & Guyard, 2003; Fondrillon, 2012; Macphail, 2010; Macphail et al., 2003). Without doubt, this stance explains the gap in knowledge concerning town development between the end of the Roman Empire and the High Medieval period. However, over the last decades, its restrictions have become clear. Units with a similar appearance have been discovered outside

the borders of the Roman Empire (Heimdahl, 2005; Krupski, Kabala, Sady, Glinski, & Wojcieszak, 2017; Prokof'eva, Varava, Sedov, & Kuznetsova, 2010; Wouters, 2016), and in cities with no Roman past. Others appeared to belong to medieval and postmedieval dates (Devos et al., 2009; Louis, 2004; Wouters et al., 2017). As a consequence, archaeo-environmental specialists elaborated on a more generic definition (Devos et al., 2009; Heimdahl, 2005; Macphail, 2003; Macphail, 2010; Nicosia & Devos, 2014; Nicosia et al., 2013; Nicosia, Devos, & Macphail, 2017), as a complement to the traditional "narrow" definition (see 'narrow use of the term in Macphail et al., 2003; see also Nicosia, 2018; Nicosia et al., 2017), Today, urban Dark Earth sensu lato has become a descriptive expression used in European urban archaeology to designate thick, dark coloured, humic, and homogeneous units covering large surfaces that are often rich in anthropogenic remains (charcoal, ceramic, brick, bone, mortar, coprolites, slag, etc.), regardless of their age or geographical location.

Their presence in Belgian urban contexts is ubiquitous, with Dark Earth being reported in Brussels, Ghent, Antwerp, Aalst, Lier, Tongeren, Mechelen, Oudenaarde, leper, Tournai, Namur, Mons, and so forth. In many cases, their observation has not been followed by further study. This is unfortunate as the interpretation of these homogeneous deposits is a key issue. Making interpretations based on traditional archaeological methods alone has shown to be a difficult, if not impossible, task (Cammas et al., 1995; David et al., 2000). This includes the excavation in artificial spits and subsequent sieving of Dark Earths material, an approach commonly applied in Belgium in the past. The latter does inform about the content of the Dark Earth but is not suited to identify how units were formed. The application of geoarchaeological methods, especially micromorphology, ideally combined with physicochemical analyses, has shown to be particularly rewarding in understanding the complex formation of Dark Earths, and to understand their archaeological significance (Borderie, Devos, Nicosia, Cammas, & Macphail, 2015; Cammas et al.,

1995; Devos, 2019a; Devos et al., 2011; Macphail, 1994; Nicosia & Devos, 2014; Nicosia et al., 2013; Wouters et al., 2017). Such studies have demonstrated that Dark Earths result from a complex interaction of human activities (e.g., agricultural practices, artisanal activities, construction/demolition, etc.) and natural phenomena (e.g., erosion, colluviation, alluviation, bioturbation, acidification, alkalization, etc.—see e.g., Cammas, 2000; Devos, 2019a; Devos et al., 2007b, 2009, 2011, 2013a, 2017a; Goldberg & Macphail, 2006; Macphail, 1994, 2010; Nicosia, 2018; Nicosia et al., 2017; Nicosia et al., 2012). In the past, a series of models have been developed to understand their complex formation history (see for instance Galinié, 2004; Heimdahl, 2005; Macphail, 1994). Based on the numerous observations within Brussels a specific model has been developed (Devos, 2019a; Devos et al., 2011). At different levels, it takes into account parent materials, time, climate, topography, cultural and noncultural processes, human activities, and continuity.

Taking into account their extremely complex and unique formation histories, each Dark Earth should be investigated on an individual basis. Systematic study of these units not only contributes to the understanding of the site stratigraphy, but it also aids interpreting the spatial organization of sites and neighborhoods within the city, the urban development and the urban environment (Borderie et al., 2015; Devos, 2019a; Macphail, 2010; Nicosia & Devos, 2014; Wouters, 2019). That each Dark Earth houses an idiosyncratic past use is clear from the cases that have been analysed using geoarchaeological methods, and micromorphology in particular.

In Brussels, the following main activities have been identified: pasture, cultivation, middening, gardening, construction/destruction, quarrying/extraction, abandonment, leveling, metalworking, market, and domestic activities (see Devos, 2012a, 2015, 2019a; Devos et al., 2009, 2011; Devos, Nicosa, Vrydaghs, & Modrie, 2013b; Devos et al. 2017a). The study of Dark Earth in Aalst, Tongeren, Lier, Ypres, and Antwerp also showed the presence of agricultural and/or pastoral activities (Devos, 2012b; Devos et al., 2013a; Wouters & Devos, 2017; Wouters et al., 2017, 2019), with horticulture attested in Late-Roman Tongeren only (Wouters et al., 2019). The Dark Earths from the market place (Grote Markt) in Lier bore further witness of levelling, neighbouring construction, craft working, and market activities (Wouters et al., 2017), while those in leper also attested stabling of animals, roadside waste dumping, and domestic activities (Wouters & Devos, 2017). Agriculture, horticulture, middening and neighboring construction, and craft working were also identified in the Dark Earth from Mons in Wallonia (Devos, Collette, Vrydaghs, & Loicq, 2017c).

In addition, the systematic and multidisciplinary study of dark earths in the center of Brussels over the last 20 years have proven of great value. It has allowed the gathering of vast amounts of information on the spatial organization of activities, especially for the 10th-13th centuries, resulting in the functional mapping of all excavated dark earths of the town's territory. The first soil occupation map showing the area's use and evolution through time was created on the basis of this information (see Borderie et al., 2014; Degraeve et al., 2010; Devos, 2015, 2019a; Vannieuwenhuyze et al., 2012).

Microstratified layers are successions of millimeter thick deposits that can hardly be described at a macroscopic scale. They are often related to ancient occupation surfaces and roads. Micromorphology has fruitfully been applied to study them (Cammas, 2010; Charbonnier, Cammas, Bak, Cavo, & Neaud, 2016; Gé, Courty, Matthews, & Wattez, 1993; Macphail & Goldberg, 2018; Milek, 1997; Milek & French, 2007; Shillito & Ryan, 2013). The study of a series of such microstratified deposits in Brussels and Flanders demonstrates their importance to the understanding of the use of space within towns. Domestic house floors and stable floors have been identified in Brussels, Antwerp, and Ypres (Crabtree et al., 2017; Devos et al., 2013a, 2013b; Puy, 2018; Wouters & Devos, 2017). Floor preparation layers were observed in Tongeren (Wouters et al., 2019), and a fireplace in Brussels (Devos et al., 2009). Moreover, microstratified deposits can be used to obtain information about the spatial organization that surpasses the household level, for instance regarding the organization of neighborhoods and road systems. An example of this is the market surfaces studied in Brussels and Lier (Devos, 2017b; Wouters et al., 2017), or the "street market" area that was discovered in Ypres (Wouters, Devos, Bartholomieux, & Bradt, 2018). In addition to a better understanding of the spatial organization, the study of the market areas also contributes to knowledge of how these markets came into being, their outlook and its socio-political implications, as well as the character of trade within towns at different moments in time.

# 2.2 | The impact of urbanization on soils

Although the Belgian soil map is well documented and based on a wealth of field data (ca. 2 observations per ha; Dudal, Deckers, Van Orshoven, & Van Ranst, 2005; Van Ranst & Sys, 2000), urban areas have in fact never been studied systematically. On the Belgian soil map, these areas are registered as OB (built zone). In spite of this, urban areas contain a wealth of different soils and "palaeosols."

A first type are the relict soils bearing witness of pre and protourban periods. These soils range from buried natural soils, such as alluvial soils or peat deposits in the Senne (Devos, 2012c; Devos & Nicosia, 2016; Devos et al., 2017b; Fechner, 2001c) and Scheldt valleys (Bellens, Martens, Minsaer, & Schryvers, 2013; Bellens, Schryvers, & Minsaer, 2010; Geysen, 2009), buried Podzols (Depuydt, Kinnaer, & Van de Vijver, 2013; Fokedey & Smeets, 2013; Lettany, 2003.), and buried Luvisols (De Groote, 2013; Devos, 2017a), to buried soils already showing induced topsoil changes and occasionally induced deep topsoil disturbance (sensu Dudal, Nachtergaele, & Purnell, 2000). Examples of this are the ancient cultivated soils observed in several town centres like Aalst (Devos, 2012b), Antwerp (Devos et al., 2013a; Wouters, Milek, Devos, & Tys, 2016), Ghent (Langohr, 2012), Mechelen (Wuyts, 2012), Mons (Devos et al., 2017c), and Brussels (Devos et al., 2007a, 2009, 2013b; 2017a). These soils often show thick A-horizons ( $>20\mathrm{cm}$ ) due to the addition of soil sods, waste, and/or colluvium/alluvium that got thoroughly mixed within the topsoil. According to the FAO/WRB guidelines (F.A.O., 2014), these can be classified as Anthrosols, soils

modified by long-continued cultivation or addition of material (e.g., manuring, middening, etc.).

Progressing urbanization is reflected by large-scale transportation of materials that often leads to truncation or the sealing of existing soils, and to the creation of new types of soils. One such type is the so-called Technosol (F.A.O., 2014). This type of soil is characterized more generally by its containing of "a significant amount of artifacts" (F.A.O., 2014, p. 168). When over  $35\%$  of the artifacts consist of "rubble and garbage of human settlements"—a condition frequently met by Belgian Dark Earths—the qualifier "urbic" is added. In fact, Holliday (2004); (2017) has proposed to adopt the classification name of Urbic Anthrosols for Dark Earths. A typical example of such Urbic Anthrosols are gardens developed on leveling layers mainly composed of construction debris. They have for instance been observed on the sites of the Court of Hoogstraeten and Relais Postal in Brussels (Devos et al., 2013b; Devos, 2018; Devos, 2019a) and the Vermeulenstraat site in Tongeren (Wouters et al., 2019). Other examples are the market occupation levels developing on top of leveling layers mainly composed of construction debris as observed on the Grote Markt site of Lier (Wouters et al., 2017).

In older versions of the FAO/WRB soil classification (see F.A.O., 2006), an important reference was made to the concept of "Human Transported Materials" (HTMs). These were defined as allochtonous soil materials imported "for agricultural purposes (and) for human settlement" which became "parent material for pedogenesis, by analogy to fluvial sediments and colluvium" (definitions from F.A.O., 2006, p. 61). This definition eloquently depicts the situation of many urban archaeological soils encountered in Belgium and elsewhere. Here, the parent material might include a mixture of different soil and sediment types and, distinguishable, be enriched with artifacts produced by human dwelling in the city, often as waste. More rarely, the parent material would be deposited by processes such as alluvial or colluvial ones. Examples of the latter have for instance been observed on the sites of Mundaneum, Mons (Devos et al., 2017c), Oude Vismarkt, Aalst (De Groote, 2013), or Petit Rue des Bouchers, Brussels (Devos et al., 2017a). Unfortunately, in newer versions of the FAO/WRB guidelines (see F.A.O., 2014), HTMs are no longer mentioned.

The pedogenic processes most widely attested in the urban archaeological soils of Belgium include bioturbation, oxido-reduction, humification, decarbonation, alkalinization, and slaking or the mechanical down-profile translocation of fine particles (De Ploey & Mücher, 1981). The latter is mostly related to topsoil disturbance induced by agricultural practices, which are typical not only of the rural but also—importantly—of urban and protourban contexts (see Goldberg & Macphail, 2006; Macphail & Goldberg, 2018). Activities such as tillage, cultivation, manuring, and liming interact with pedogenesis, and thus have a significant impact on soil evolution. Other activities, such as backfilling, quarrying, excavation, construction of buildings, and floors, etc. might instead hamper pedogenesis (see Section 2.5). The resulting picture is one of complexity, as all these processes, natural and human-related, are superimposed and nonlinear.

Systematically documenting all these soils is required to reach a better understanding of the human impact on soils in urban areas. It will contribute to filling in the empty spots on the soil maps and in turn creating a more complete picture of the impact of urbanization on the soils and the ancient relief, which brings us to the following sections.

# 2.3 Rivers in towns

For alluvial urban sites, the changes in the local river system and its effects on the environment are an important topic of study in many European countries (see for instance Morin, Rodier, Laurent-Dehecq, & Macaire, 2014; Nicosa, 2018; Sidell, Wilkinson, Scaife, & Cameron, 2000). In Belgium, however, despite the numerous excavations in alluvial contexts and the discovery of ancient river embankments (see for instance Mora-Dieu, 2008; Pype, Nijssen, & Coenaerts, 2018; Vermeiren, Bru, Bradt, & Laisnez, 2013), such studies remain rare. Notable exceptions are the ongoing research on the Senne valley in Brussels and the study of past hydrography in Bruges (Hillewaert, 2015) and Ghent (Gelaude, 2019).

In Brussels, the research of the Senne valley is aimed at creating a better understanding of the hydrographic network and its relationship with past urbanization. Historians have already established that there are major difficulties with reconstructing the course of the pristine brooks and river channels (see for instance Deligne, 2003). A series of recent geoarchaeological studies now permit the reconstruction of a number of these ancient branches. Associated with the study of the ancient channel courses is a comprehensive assessment of the evolution of the vegetation in the surroundings and the impact of urbanisation through time (De Cupere et al., 2017; Devos & Degraeve, 2018; Devos et al., 2017c; Meganck, Modrie, & Devos, 2019). In Ghent, geoarchaeological studies combined with an extensive study of the historical records produced a reconstruction of the pristine riverine landscape and the subsequent human-induced shaping of a new hydraulic landscape through the straightening of riverbeds, and the construction of dikes and reinforcements (Devriese & Gelaude, 2010; Gelaude, 2019).

# 2.4 | Reconstructing the ancient topography

One main aspect of the physical environment is the study of ancient relief and its modifications through time. The urbanization process has incontestably had a huge impact on the ancient relief. For instance, an excavation performed in the center of Ghent shows the presence of 12th-13th-century street levels more than  $2\mathrm{m}$  below the actual surface level (Vermeiren, Bru, Vanderginst, & van der Waa, 2016). In Antwerp, a 14th-15th century paved street level is observed  $2.4\mathrm{m}$  below the actual street level (Hendriks, Martens, Minsaer, & Vanswevelt, 2016). Geoarchaeological studies can also help to determine ancient surface levels. On the site of the Court of Hoogstraeten it was thus possible to determine that the present-day floor level was ca.  $1\mathrm{m}$  higher compared with the occupation surface of the 16th-17th century, and almost  $2\mathrm{m}$  higher than the

surface level of the 10th-12th century AD (Devos et al., 2013b). Another example is the site of Petitie rue de Bouchers where the current surface is  $3\mathrm{m}$  higher than that of the 9th-11th century AD (Devos et al., 2014). In the early medieval center of Antwerp too, the present-day surface is located more than  $3\mathrm{m}$  higher than the 10th-century level (Devos et al., 2013a). In Lier, the 11th-12th century cultivated surface is about  $2\mathrm{m}$  lower than the actual market street level (Wouters et al., 2017). Although this punctual and very precise information exists for a substantial number of sites, the systematic research and mapping of these data still need to be done in Belgian towns. In an urban context, the reconstruction of ancient topography is a particularly difficult task, given the severe modifications that construction activities, demolitions of building, ground-raising, and ground-leveling phases have brought about through the centuries.

The increasing number of investigated sites within urban contexts, in combination with the present-day mapping and deposit modeling possibilities (GIS, LiDAR, etc.), provide a promising framework to study the ancient urban topography and its changes through time. This requires a multiscalar approach, in which the reconstruction of ancient topography is key to understand processes such as colluvium or slopewash operating on a site, with the aim of reconstructing its formation processes.

# 2.5 | Soil erosion and soil protection

Urban contexts have at times shown to be excellent protectors of ancient soils and sediments. Examples are ancient agricultural horizons that have been sealed by city walls and earthen ramparts in Aalst (Devos, 2012b), Antwerp (Devos et al., 2013a), and Brussels (Devos et al., 2007a, 2009; Figure 5), or by meters of construction rubble like was the case in the Court of Hoogstraeten, Brussels (Devos et al., 2013b) that stopped further soil development from taking place. As this type of rapid sealing is rather exceptional in rural contexts, urban sites preserving traces of ancient cultivated areas

become an important source to estimate aspects of their fertility, to calculate the amount of added manure and the potential yields based on land evaluation models. So far all estimations are performed on rural nonsealed soils (Adderley, Simpson, Lockheart, Evershed, & Davidson, 2000; Louwagie, Stevenson, & Langohr, 2006), thus implying potential postdepositional impact.

Ancient floor levels and walking surfaces are sometimes also sealed by thick urban deposits. Examples have been found in Brussels (Devos et al., 2009, 2013b), Antwerp (Crabtree et al., 2017; Devos et al., 2013a), Lier (Wouters et al., 2017), Tongeren (Wouters et al., 2019), and Ypres (Wouters & Devos, 2017).

On the other hand, urban activities can also deeply affect and even destroy soils and sediments. The most obvious example is that of present-day construction work, during which several meters of ancient soils and sediments are often dug away. Digging is not only restricted to present-day activities. Past traces of quarrying and soil extraction have for instance been encountered on several sites in Brussels (Devos et al., 2007a, 2007b, 2011; Vannieuwenhuyze et al., 2012), Aalst (De Groote, Ameels, Moens, & Debonne, 2010), and Tongeren (Vanderhoeven et al., 2014; Veldman, Geerts, Hazen, & van der Velde, 2014), thus bearing witness to an important displacement of sediments within the urban territory. Traces of natural, though probably human-induced, erosion related to unprotected sloping surfaces have also been observed, for instance on the site of rue de Dinant (Devos et al., 2011). The indirect evidence of such erosion is the presence of colluvium on the sites of rue d'Une Personne (Fechner, 1997a) and Petit Rue des Bouchers (Devos et al., 2017a) in Brussels. Thick deposits of colluvium have also been observed in the center of Aalst (De Groote, 2013).

The displacement of soils and sediments during construction works and natural erosion is only one hazard. Another, more indirect threat affecting the urban soils and their organic content is the lowering of the water table in the alluvial valleys. This problem has been studied in detail for a series of European towns such as Bergen, in Norway, and Gouda, the Netherlands. In Bergen, it was discovered that the remains of the buried old town, which had remained exceptionally well preserved for centuries, were quickly degrading due to groundwater level fluctuations. This led to the development of an intense monitoring and mitigation program (Rytter & Schonhowd, 2015). In Gouda, the lowering of the groundwater caused the sinking of the soil surface of the area developed on peats (Willemse, 2018). Even though important parts of many Belgian towns are situated in alluvial areas, no monitoring of the situation has been initiated so far, implying that the degradation of an important part of the soil archive is going unnoticed. Here, curatorial decisions on whether to investigate or protect historic towns should be taken on the basis of an overall understanding of whole townscapes. This understanding can be achieved by using deposit models (see for instance Carey, Howard, Knight, Corcoran, & Heathcote, 2018), which geoarchaeological studies can help construct. One example is the extensive borehole and monitoring program carried out to evaluate the preservation state of the organic remains in Nantwich, UK (Malim, 2018).

# 2.6 | Ancient soil pollution

Soil pollution and the resulting health risks have become a worldwide issue. Although it is mostly due to modern activities, soil contamination can also be of greater age. Besides ancient mining (Irabien, Cearreta, & Urteaga, 2012; Knabb et al., 2016), preindustrial urban activities can also result in soil contamination. Several studies have been performed gaining insight in the historical pollution in urban contexts abroad (Borderie, 2011; Cook et al., 2010; Golding, 2008; Hudson-Edwards, Macklin, Finlayson, & Passmore, 1999; Macphail, Crowther, & Cruise, 2007).

In Belgium, such studies are almost nonexistent. One exception is Brussels where a geochemical study is performed on a series of archaeological sites in the center of Brussels. It shows that in the Senne valley preindustrial soil pollution seemed predominantly due to the accumulation of organic waste. Heavy metal pollution was quasi absent in the historical center for the 10th-13th century AD. For the 14th-17th century enhanced values of Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn were observed on almost all studied sites (Devos, 2004, 2018, 2019a, 2019b; Devos & Laurent, 2006; Devos, Vrydaghs, Degraeve, & Modrie, 2010; Devos et al., 2017a). On a number of sites, enhanced values could be related to the presence of microscopic traces of metallurgical slag, indicating the proximity of smithies (Devos, 2019a; 2019b; Devos et al., 2014). Further studies integrating micromorphology and geochemical analysis are required to acquire more insight into the origins and importance of soil pollution in preindustrial urban areas.

# 2.7 | The integration of geoarchaeology and other archaeoenvironmental studies

The integration of geoarchaeology and other archaeo-environmental studies has shown to offer great potential to understand urban development. Stratigraphy is the fundamental reference point for all specialists working on a site. Stratigraphic units or soil horizons make up the "context" (Goldberg & Berna, 2010) within which all artefacts and ecofacts are contained. Stratigraphic relationships and postdepositional modifications brought about by pedogenic processes are in the first place disentangled by geoarchaeologists. It, therefore, appears clear how other specialists (archaeobotanists, archaeozoologs, dating specialists, etc.) depend on the pedo-stratigraphic "grid" set out by geoarchaeologists to position their data. These grids are presented as comprehensive models showing the relations and chronology of natural events and human activities (see for instance Devos, 2019a; Devos et al., 2011; Nicosia & Devos, 2014). Moreover, the analysis of a site's pedo-stratigraphic sequence takes into account data derived from a multiscalar approach. The latter incorporates strands of evidence that are relevant for all other disciplines involved in a scientific archaeological study. These range from information gathered at the regional or supra-regional scale (regional geology, geomorphology, soils) to microscopic or submicroscopic observations carried out on single layers or horizons. At these scales, geoarchaeologists assess the reliability of very specific

intervals of a site's stratigraphy before other analyses (pollen, charcoal, macro-remains, etc.) are carried out. This is done by identifying traces of processes such as bioturbation, degradation, reworking, etc.

Geoarchaeological studies can also greatly benefit from the information gained by other specialists. Beyond the transfer of traditional identifications and quantifications of the collected remains and their interpretation, finds abrasion and faunal fragmentation and/or alteration can contribute to understanding the site taphonomy.

While in Brussels an interdisciplinary approach is systematically applied, in Flanders, there have so far only been occasional attempts for such integrated research. For Antwerp, Lier, and Tongeren, the integration of botanical (e.g. phytolith studies) and geoarchaeological studies allowed the identification of cultivated areas, particular soil practices (manuring, etc.) and frequently the determination of the cultivated crops (Devos et al., 2013a, Wouters et al., 2017, 2019). Another example is the Burchtsite in Antwerp where integrating insect studies and micromorphology helped to establish the function of a series of floors (Crabtree et al., 2017). Despite the promising results, no specific protocols have been established in Flanders.

# 3 | PERSPECTIVES: TOWARDS AN INTEGRATED STUDY OF THE URBAN LANDSCAPE AND SOILSCAPE

Based on the studies undertaken in Belgium and other countries, a series of key research themes can be envisaged for future work in the field of urban geoarchaeology in Belgium. They cover issues such as methodological improvements and synthesis, but also the in situ preservation of sites and archaeological remains.

# 3.1 | The in situ preservation of sites and archaeological remains

The preservation conditions of sites are an important issue in urban archaeology (Corfield, Hinton, Nixon, & Pollard, 1998; Davis, Hall, Kenward, & Oxley, 2001; Kars & van Heeringen, 2008; Nixon, 2004; Rytter & Schonhowd, 2015). Geoarchaeological studies are optimally suited to shed light on current and past preservation state of different types of objects (organic remains, bones, etc.; Louwagie, Noens, & Devos, 2005; Matthiesen, 2007; Huisman, 2009). Thus, they have a strong potential to guide excavators with regard to which types of remains they should expect to find, but also on how to preserve objects and structures in situ. Moreover, the preservation of different soils and sediments can also be evaluated. They are in fact important depositories of information on life in cities in the past. Some of the processes that can hamper soil conservation in archaeological contexts have been outlined above: erosion, quarrying, and indiscriminate removal due to construction activities. In addition, water fluctuations and acidification can have a pronounced impact on their preservation as well. Despite the importance of the in

situ preservation of archaeological remains and sites, no specific studies have so far been carried out on urban sites in Belgium, while they are definitely required.

# 3.2 | Methodological innovations and method development

Urban geoarchaeology is a developing field and has much to offer in the scope of applying new methodologies, as well as in the development of novel methods and approaches. Research on Belgian sites has contributed to several strands of method development in urban geoarchaeology and beyond. One example is the pioneering work by Vrydaghs, Devos, and Ball (Vrydaghs, Ball, & Devos, 2016b; Vrydaghs & Devos, in press), who have established a sound protocol for the study of phytoliths in thin sections. This method has proven a dependable and statistically valid approach in which the precise provenance and context of the studied phytoliths are taken into account. In addition, pioneering work on burnt phytoliths is currently being developed, including fluorescence microscopy, microXRF, and experimental studies (Devos, Vrydaghs, & Wouters, 2018). This will have implications that reach far beyond urban geoarchaeology, touching upon phytolith studies as a field. A second example is the analysis of metals in thin section using microXRF. It was already known that microXRF can be used for the determination of chemical elements on impregnated micromorphological soil and sediment blocks. However, for metals even covered thin sections can be used (Wouters et al., 2017). This holds potential for the study of craft working, trade, as well as pollution in towns. MicroXRF has also been used to confirm elusive deposits such as stable floors by mapping their phosphorus content, for instance in early medieval Antwerpen (Crabtree et al., 2017).

Another promising technique is the study of parasites in thin sections. First tests on a series of Dark Earth thin sections from Brussels show its potential to better understand their distribution within the different Dark Earth units (Pümpin, 2016).

Furthermore, new molecular methods are being developed elsewhere in Europe. Recently, studies on lipid biomarkers (Harrault et al., 2019) and soil and sediment ancient DNA (Alsos et al., 2018; Lammers et al., 2019; Parducci et al., 2017) have proven promising for respectively the identification and distinction of faecal matter in sediments, and for the identification of animals and plants to a species level. Specifically concerning urban deposits, an experiment is currently being undertaken by M. W. Pedersen regarding ancient DNA in the framework of the recent excavation in Ribe (Denmark), and the study of lipid biomarkers in combination with geoarchaeological methods has been applied to Hedeby (Germany) by L. Harrault, K. Milek, and B. Wouters. These methods have not yet been applied to Belgian urban areas, but offer great perspectives for future studies.

# 3.3 | Synthesis

Attempts at syntheses are largely missing for towns. The main reason for this is the lack of an integrated approach. In Belgium, the

realization that in order to face the complexity of the formation of the urban sediments and soils, good quality data based on a well-defined pedo-stratigraphic grid are required, still needs to grow.

Although evidence is mainly collected on a case-by-case basis, the increasing amount of well-dated and accurate data offers great potential for overarching syntheses. So far there is only one example where a spatial synthesis based on the integrated data from historians, archaeologists, geoarchaeologists, archaeobotanists, and zooarchaeologists, exists. This is the already mentioned case of Brussels, mapping the spatial organization of activities within the center of the town and vegetation changes through time (Charruadas et al., 2017; Degraeve et al., 2010; Vannieuwenhuyze et al., 2012). Systematic geoarchaeological research in Flemish and Walloon town centers must enable researchers to obtain the necessary data to come to a similar synthesis. A promising direction to follow in this respect is that of deposit modeling that was recently implemented in the UK (Carey et al., 2018).

Apart from town-based syntheses, however, there is a growing need for topical synthesis studies as well. With a growing body of geoarchaeological and micromorphological studies on (early) medieval towns in Belgium, there is a large untapped potential for addressing a number of important themes that have remained understudied, save for single pinpoints, in the urban landscape in Belgium.

One such topic is agriculture and gardening within towns. The presence of agriculture within towns and its impact on the townscape has for instance been dealt with in detail in a series of Scandinavian towns (see for instance Heimdahl, 2005; Petersén, Sandvik, & Svestrup, 2015). In Belgium, such a synthesis is still largely missing, except for Brussels (see Devos, 2019a; Vrydaghs et al., 2016a). A second topic is that of market formation. Market places are an important component of towns, but their geoarchaeological research is a very recent development. Still, the earliest phases of the famous Flemish market towns are completely unknown from written sources. A first in-depth study on the central market place of Lier (Wouters et al., 2017) shows that such studies can provide very detailed information on the development of the market area and the activities taking place. Over the last few years an extensive sampling program has been carried out on a series of markets in Brussels, Oudenaarde, leper, and Vilvoorde, and hopefully, other towns will follow. Moreover, despite long being recognized as an important theme (see for instance Hall & Kenward, 1994), studies of the relationships between urban landscapes and their hinterland are still lacking. Other themes that deserve overarching study are human-animal relationships in towns, craft working, and aspects of housing and daily life.

Finally, in addition to producing data, interpreting them, and developing syntheses, larger historical and social questions should be integrated within the interpreting process, hereby not shying away from theoretical developments. Thanks to our understanding of the formation processes of sites and their stratigraphy, we are in a unique position to enhance our storytelling, in the first place to the commissioning archaeologists, archaeological companies, and

colleagues, but also to a wider audience. By doing this, we are able to contribute to the promotion of urban geoarchaeology. By all hopes, it will as such become a requirement in the study of all urban sites in Belgium, including those in Flanders and Wallonia.
