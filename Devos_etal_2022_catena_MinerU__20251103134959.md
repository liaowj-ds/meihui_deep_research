# ABSTRACT

Among the buried urban Anthropsols and Technosols, urban Dark Earth composes a major challenge to urban archaeologists and soil scientists. These homogeneous units are often the result of a complex formation history, involving human actions and natural processes. In order to understand the significance of the late medieval to pre-industrial urban Dark Earth observed on the site of Mundaneum in the historical centre of Mons (Belgium) an integrated soil micromorphological and phytolith study has been performed.

The aim of this study is to understand how the urban Dark Earth formed and to identify the major natural and human processes that are involved in its formation. The results show that major natural processes are bioturbation, sedimentation, humification, alkalinisation and clay translocation. These processes are mainly human induced. Main human activities include cereal cultivation, horticulture, dumping of waste and trampling. Phytoliths proved to be an important witness of the presence of plant material, in a context where organic remains tend to decompose rapidly. The integrated approach allowed to come to a better understanding of the taphonomical history of the phytoliths, hence permitting to distinguish plant remains related to manure, cereal processing and in situ cultivated plants. The study further permitted the authors to gain insight in part of the biography of the site and its surroundings, hence showing changes in spatial organisation and the progressive urbanisation of the area. As such, this analysis provides an important stepstone to the further geoarchaeological study of town development in Medieval and Modern periods.

# 1. Introduction

Since several decades many European historical town centres have been affected by major transformations due to city planning and reorganisation of space (Heighway, 1972; Laleman, 1999). This involves often the removal of important quantities of soils and sediments. Beyond being the matrix preserving archaeological features and artefacts, the soils and sediments themselves bear witness to different aspects of the urban development. An important component are the so-called urban Dark Earths. These can be defined as thick dark coloured, humic, homogeneous units that are often rich in anthropogenic remains (charcoal, potsherds, brick fragments, bone, mortar, coprolites, slag, etc.) and that cover large areas (Nicosia & Devos, 2014; Nicosia et al., 2017, Devos,

2019). According to WRB/FAO guidelines they can be classified as Anthrosols: soils modified by long-continued cultivation or addition of material (e.g. middening, manuring, etc.). Occasionally they can be attributed to the Technosols: soils that more generally "contain a significant amount of artefacts" (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015). Such broad classifications, however, do not significantly contribute to comprehend their formation or archaeological significance. Due to a lack of internal stratigraphy their interpretation composes a major challenge for urban archaeologists. Over the last decades geoarchaeology, and soil micromorphology in particular, has shown to be a particularly valuable approach (see for instance Macphail, 1983; 1994; Cammas, 2004; Borderie et al., 2015; Nicosia et al., 2017). It enables the discrimination of the major processes involved in the Dark Earth

formation and to detect human activities and natural events triggering them. As such a series of models have been developed taking into account various factors such as parent material (including archaeological components), time (duration), climate, topography, cultural and non-cultural processes, human activities and continuity (Macphail, 1994; Heimdahl, 2005; Devos, 2019). Furthermore, a relative chronology of events can be established (see for instance Macphail et al., 2007; Devos et al., 2013a; 2017; Borderie, 2011; Nicosia et al., 2017). Beyond identifying soil formation processes and human activities, the systematic study of Dark Earth in a series of European towns has significantly improved our knowledge on the evolution of the urban environment (see for instance Macphail, 1994; Nicosia et al., 2012; Devos et al., 2017), the transition between the Roman and high medieval period (see for instance Macphail, 1994; 2010; Macphail et al., 2003; Guyard, 2003; Borderie, 2011; Borderie et al., 2014; Nicosia, 2018), the early developments of a series of medieval towns (see for instance Devos et al., 2011; 2013b; 2020; Wouters, 2017; Wouters et al., 2017) and the organisation of space within towns (see for instance Macphail, 2010; Borderie, 2011; Wouters, 2017; Macphail & Goldberg, 2018; Devos, 2019). The numerous studies all demonstrated the often complex and unique formation history of the urban Dark Earths. To come to a thorough understanding, this implies thus that Dark Earth should be studied on an individual basis.

A significant part of the urban Dark Earth testifies of ancient agricultural practices (see for instance Macphail, 1994; Devos et al., 2009; 2013a; 2013b; 2017; Krupski et al., 2017; Wouters et al., 2017; 2019). The identification of in situ cultivated plants on these ancient fields is often a delicate exercise. Indeed, the preservation of organic plant remains of these contexts is generally poor due to working and aeration of the soil. Opal phytoliths, being of mineral origin (monosilicic acid: Si  $(\mathrm{OH}_4))$  , tend to preserve better in such contexts (Piperno, 2006). Therefore they complement the traditional botanical toolkit. As these phytoliths can have various botanical origins and/or (post-) depositional histories (see Harvey & Fuller, 2005; Madella & Lancelotti, 2012) their taphonomical pathways need to be clarified (Kaczoreck et al., 2018). Integrated micromorphological and phytolith analyses has shown to be a useful tool to address this issue (see for instance Devos et al., 2009; Vrydaghs et al., 2016a; Wouters et al., 2019).

This study is the first in the Walloon Region (Belgium) applying such an integrated approach on urban Dark Earth. Developed for a single site, Mundaneum, where the dark earth covers a period ranging from the late medieval to the pre-industrial period, it intends to highlight the potential of an integrated soil micromorphological and phytolith study. More specifically the study will address how it contributes to the understanding of the formation processes and human activities involved in the formation of urban Dark Earth, including activities involving plant material in a context where organic remains tend to preserve badly. In a second stage it will be discussed how part of a sites' previously unknown biography can be established through the study of the urban Dark Earth. Finally, the contribution of the study of Dark Earth to the understanding of progressing urbanisation will be detailed.

# 2. The studied site

The site is located in the historical centre of town on the hill of Mons, which lies within the Haine Depression, a vast naturally marshy area. The hill has a slightly elongated shape and dominates the plain by about thirty metres. The southern slopes are rather steep while those exposed to the east and north are less marked. Two rivers, the Haine and the Trouille approach each other at the foot of the hill (Fig. 1) to finally merge in the town of Jemappes. The Mundaneum site itself is situated on the northeast footslope of the hill, on a small terrace slightly dominating the alluvial plain. The elevation of the site is  $+45\mathrm{m}$  above sea level. Geologically, the hill is composed of Eocene sands and clays, while in the surrounding valley Paleocene sands prevail (Marlière, 1967; Lousberg, 1980).

As the site is situated in the present town centre and marked as "built area" (OB) on the Belgian soil map (de Roubaix, 1974), no detailed information on local soil development is available.

The city of Mons originates from the establishment of an oratory and a monastery slightly south of the hilltop by Waudru, an aristocratic member of the Merovingian society, in the 7th century. The sanctification of the founder and the deposit of her relics in the church gave rise to pilgrimages followed by the development of a village and a trading network. As early as the 10th century, a keep was built on the top of the hill by the Counts of Hainaut. In the 12th century, a first enclosure protected the castle and the annexed religious buildings. As a result of population growth, a second enclosure was built at the end of the 13th century, encompassing the extramural buildings, the market square and surrounding grounds (Pierard & Van Bol, 1983). Some of the still forested land seems to have been rapidly cleared. The plague epidemics of the 13th and 14th centuries were followed by an increase in population from the 15th century onwards, period from which the town passed into French and Spanish hands until the 18th century. During the reign of Charles V, the town flourished thanks to the trade in cloth and woollen fabrics. This prosperity led to a strong urbanisation, confirmed by the maps of Deventer (around 1550) and of Braun & Hogenberg (1581). At the end of the 16th century, the political instability of Mons led to the desertion of craftsmen to other safer towns (Carlot, 1937-1938). The ramparts were reinforced several times, notably by Vauban bastions in the 17th century. In the following century, the town loses its status as a fortified town: Joseph II partially demolished the walls to demilitarise the town and the urban fabric had extended beyond them. They were definitively destroyed at the end of the 19th century, leaving room for large boulevards, as part of a series of projects to clean up the city in the face of epidemics (De Seyn, 1934).

In 2013-2014 the former "Service de l'archéologie de la Direction extérieure du Hainaut 1 (DGO4/Département du patrimoine)" and the "asbl Recherches et Prospections archéologiques (RPA)" excavated the site of Mundaneum (coord. Lambert: 120,700 E; 127485 N). The site is located in the periphery of the historical town centre, along the axis connecting the Grand-Place and the Porte de Nimy. The oldest evidence of human occupation on the site of Mundaneum is a Dark Earth (SU  $874^{2}$ ) covering the whole excavated surface. It is covered by more recent Dark Earth deposits (SU 873, SU 872/057, SU 871/237, SU 870 and SU 869) within which a series of archaeological structures, including pits, ditches and postholes have been observed (Fig. 2a-f). The dating of the different parts of the Dark Earth is based on archaeological finds. As for the lowest part of the Dark Earth, SU 874 can be dated to the 14th century CE or earlier and SU 873 can be dated to the 14th-15th century. For the middle part, SU 872/057 can be dated between the 15th and the 16th century and SU 871/237 between the 16th and the 17th century CE. As for the upper part SU 870 is dated between the 16th and the 17th century CE and SU 869 in the 17th/18th century (Fig. 9). The Dark Earth deposits are covered and locally truncated by a series of more recent structures. Due to its location close to the zone non aedificandi behind the ramparts and adjacent to the main street, the spatial organisation of the area in the 14th-16th centuries remains unclear. The oldest cartographical data (map of J. van Deventer) indicate that the excavated area was already in the 16th century CE an open space surrounded by habitats (Loicq & Sornasse, 2014).

(Langohr, 1994) and the Guidelines for soil profile description (FAO, 2006). Undisturbed oriented block samples were taken according to Nicosia et al. (2017). Two profiles (WP11 and WP12) were studied and sampled. Profile WP12 shows the most complete sequence (Fig. 2b, c and d). The transition between the middle and lower dark earth was also sampled in profile WP11 to take into account lateral variability (Fig. 2e and f).

# 3.2. Soil micromorphology

The seven air-dried blocks have been impregnated and cut to  $30~\mu \mathrm{m}$  thick thin sections  $(60\times 90\mathrm{mm})$  following standard laboratory procedures (see Murphy, 1986) in the Geology laboratory of the University of Liège (ULg). The thin sections were scanned with a flatbed scanner under normal light and under crossed polarisers (XPL) following Arpin et al. (2002). Observations were made with petrological microscopes under plane polarised light (PPL), under crossed polarizers (XPL), and with oblique incident light (OIL) at magnifications of  $25\mathrm{x}$ ,  $40\mathrm{x}$ ,  $100\mathrm{x}$ ,  $200\mathrm{x}$ ,  $500\mathrm{x}$ , and  $800\mathrm{x}$ . Additionally, the thin sections were equally studied under ultraviolet (UV) and blue (BL) fluorescence at  $200\mathrm{x}$  and  $500\mathrm{x}$  magnification (Stoops, 2017). The thin sections were described following the international nomenclature of Stoops (2003). Seminumerical counting of particular features (anthropogenic elements, etc.) has been performed according to Macphail & Cruise (2001) and Borderie (2011). Macroporosity has been estimated by analysing the digital XPL scans of the thin sections with ImageJ software.

# 3.3. Phytoliths in thin sections

For the phytolith study on the soil thin sections, 20 squares of 5 by 5 mm were selected within each SU. A line counting was performed on the upper and lower boundary of the selected squares at a magnification of  $500\mathrm{x}$ . Complementary, the whole surface of each selected square was scanned at a magnification of  $200\mathrm{x}$  to record articulated systems of ELONGATE DENTATE/DENDRITIC.

The phytolith analysis consists of:

- a systematic recording of the main distribution patterns (isolated, clustered and articulated) of the phytoliths (for definitions see Vrydaghs et al., 2017);  
- An inventory of the phytoliths. Phytolith nomenclature follows the International Code for Phytolith Nomenclature (ICPN2.0) (ICPT, 2019);  
- The ratio of Non-Identified phytoliths versus Identifiable phytoliths was calculated;  
- Sufficiently large and appropriately oriented articulated ELONGATE DENTATE/DENDRITIC were further subjected to morphometric analysis for botanical attribution according to Vrydaghs et al. 2016a and Ball et al. (2017). Typically, morphometric analysis (the measurement of size and shape) of archaeological phytolith assemblages involves comparing the data of the archaeological assemblages to reference taxa data. In its present state, the reference collection includes 49 taxa distributed over 156 specimen collected following Ball et al. (2017). This morphometrical analysis was complemented by Nearest Neighbor Discriminant Analysis (NNDA) (Qui & Wu, 2006) to enable more precise taxonomical attributions. NNDA is a nonparametric test that compares individual wave lobes measured in thin sections with individual wave lobes from a reference data set.

# 4. Results and discussion

The field descriptions are summarized in Table 1. According to the field data, the soil can be classified following WRB (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015) as a Hortic Anthrosol. The main micromorphological observations are presented in tables 2a and 2b and Fig. 3. Phytolith data are presented in Fig. 4a, 4b, 4c and 4d. Detailed results of the NNDA analysis can be found in the online supplementary material.

# 4.1. Eocene deposits below the Dark Earth

The Dark Earth developed directly on a truncated soil (SU 875/278) that formed on Eocene deposits. According to the field data and following WRB (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015), this truncated soil can be classified as a Glossic, Gleyic, Dystric Retisol, Cutanic (SU 875/278) (Fig. 5). It is dominated by fine to medium sand sized quartz, with

5–10 % of glauconite. The presence of prominent hard orthic iron mottles (table 1 & Fig. 6a and b) may point to the weathering of glauconite and the formation of iron oxide-gels (Gullentops, 1996). In planar view, a clear polygonal pattern is observed (Fig. 5). This can be related to pre-Holocene permafrost conditions (see for instance Van Vliet et al., 1992). The non-calcareous sandy material of SU 875/278 has, without amendments, a very limited chemical fertility. The rare observed

phytoliths are most likely intrusive.

# 4.2. The Dark Earth units

# 4.2.1. The lowest Dark Earth (14th century CE or earlier - 15th century CE)

An abrupt undulating boundary has been observed between the lowest part of the Dark Earth (SU 874) and the Eocene deposits. Although SU 874 and SU 875 share a similar mineralogical composition, the difference in sorting and texture (loamy sand) suggests a significant input of new sediments. Taken into account the anomalous thickness of this late medieval Ap-horizon  $(>30\mathrm{cm})$ , the mineralogical homogeneity, the poor sorting and the downslope position of the site, the input of colluvium can be advocated. Transport of (part of) the sedimentary

material is further suggested by the presence of subrounded to rounded anorthic iron oxide nodules (Fig. 6c) and rounded anthropogenic remains (Mücher et al., 2018).

This lower Dark Earth corresponds to a (buried) organo-mineral surface horizon. This is supported by its humic character, in combination with strong biological activity, as witnessed by the presence of sparitic biospheroids (see Becze-Déak et al., 1997; Canti, 2017), a locally more granular microstructure, organo-mineral excremental aggregates (Fig. 6c) (see Kooistra & Pulleman, 2018) and root galleries.

Although no clear marks of cultivation have been observed in the field (e.g. spade-, ard- or ploughmarks), a series of microscopic evidence points towards the physical working of this unit (tillage). Anthropogenic elements are typically strongly fragmented (Fig. 6d) and randomly distributed. Phytoliths are mainly isolated and clustered (Fig. 4a and b). All these observations point to important physical disturbance of the soil (Devos et al., 2009; 2013a; Vrydaghs et al., 2016b). Additionally, the presence of dusty, silty and layered clay coatings (Fig. 6e), and lenses of dusty humic material indicate disturbed soil surfaces with no permanent vegetation cover (Macphail et al., 1990; Simpson, 1990; French, 2003; Deak et al., 2017). Finally, the presence of implement marks points to tillage of the soil (Fig. 6a and f) (see Macphail et al., 1990; Goldberg & Macphail, 2006, Lewis, 2012).

As we are dealing with an initially poor leached non-calcareous sandy soil (see above), the level of faunal turbation can be qualified as anomalously high related to enhancement of the soil fertility (Goldberg & Macphail, 2006; Adderley et al., 2018; Lewis, 2012). The combined presence of randomly distributed pottery, glass, burned and unburned bone (Fig. 6d), charcoal, vitrified and calcareous ash, and excremental waste (including secondary phosphates (Fig. 6g) and coprolites (Fig. 6h and 6i)) confirms indeed the enrichment of the soil with domestic waste and manure (Pieters, 1990; Bakels, 1997; Simpson et al., 1998; 2005).

The field and micromorphological observations thus indicate that the oldest phase of Dark Earth formation results from colluviation, tillage and soil enrichment. Rare articulated phytoliths of cereal bracts (ELONGATE DENTATE and ELONGATE DENDRITIC) were observed within the soil matrix. In contrast to the clustered and isolated ones, they imply in situ decomposition of cereal bracts (Kaczorek et al., 2018). These articulated phytoliths are not associated to coprolithic remains or phosphatic features. Nor do they present any signs of heating, such as autofluorescence, change in colour or traces of melting (Devos et al., 2021). As such, they are not related to manure or cereal processing waste. Hence a local origin can be advocated (see Devos et al., 2009; 2013a; Wouters et al., 2019). None of the articulated phytolith systems was large enough to obtain a statistical confident taxonomical attribution.

The second Dark Earth unit (SU 873) can be subdivided into two microfabrics (SU 873a and SU 873b) (Fig. 7a). SU 873a corresponds to a humus-enriched unit with root galleries and mesofaunal activity, also indicating an ancient organo-mineral surface horizon (Gerasimova & Lebedeva, 2018). In comparison to SU 874, this unit is particularly strongly mixed by mesofaunal activity as witnessed by dominant organo-mineral excremental aggregates (Macphail, 1994; Cammas, 2004; Guttmann et al., 2006), passage features (Stoops, 2003), numerous sparitic biospheroids (Fig. 7b) (Becze-Déak et al., 1997; Canti, 2017) and (root) channels. We also noted a higher macroporosity in this horizon (Fig. 3a). In combination with the observation of an undulating lower boundary and the presence of mole galleries (table 1), a grass-covered soil surface (Barrat, 1964; Ponge, 2003) or fallow can be proposed. As no traces of limpid clay coatings evoking a permanent soil cover have been observed (see for instance Devos et al., 2013a; 2019), a more detailed characterisation remains problematic.

Within fabric SU 873b that is best preserved towards the top of SU 873, the combined presence of implement marks, dusty, silty and layered clay coatings, and lenses of dusty humic material fragments suggest cultivation episodes. Rare articulated phytoliths of cereal bracts within the soil matrix were observed pointing to the in situ decomposition of the cereal bracts (see higher) (Fig. 7c). Also here a local origin can

be advocated. According to the statistical analysis of the morphometric variables these phytoliths can be attributed with a  $73.33\%$  of confidence to Secale cereale (see supplementary material). Finally, the presence of excremental (Fig. 7d) and household waste (including charcoal, charred seeds, calcareous ash, pottery and burned soil fragments (Fig. 7e), burned and unburned bone) indicates soil enrichment.

Also for SU 873, the presence of subrounded to rounded anorthic iron nodules and rounded anthropogenic remains suggest the transport of sedimentary material (e.g. the input of colluvium).

# 4.2.2. The middle and upper Dark Earth (15th-18th century)

The middle part of the Dark Earth (SU 872/057 and SU 871/237) shows a much stronger degree of anthropisation compared to the underlying units. This is reflected by the diversity and richness in anthropogenic remains (Fig. 3b). The combined presence of ceramics (Fig. 7h), burned and unburned bone (Fig. 7i), fish bone, charred seeds and calcareous ashes points to domestic (kitchen) waste (Devos et al., 2019). Glass like silica indicating high temperature heating (Fig. 7i and 8b) (Courty et al., 1989; Cammas, 2010; Viklund et al., 2013), metal droplets and metallurgical slag (Fig. 8c, 8d and 8e) (see Angelini et al., 2017) are part of the artisanal waste. Mortar fragments and earthen-based construction material are indicators of construction/destruction debris. Secondary phosphates in combination with excremental remains (omnivore-carnivore coprolites) indicate excremental waste.

Although these units are particularly rich in anthropogenic remains, they are not the result of a simple deposit/dump of waste material. Their homogeneity indicates that the rate of accretion was clearly slower than the process of soil homogenisation (see Devos et al., 2019). The homogenisation seems to be the result of the combination of biological activity and human actions (digging). The former is reflected by the presence of organo-mineral excremental aggregates (Macphail, 1994; Cammas, 2004; Guttmann et al., 2006), the many sparitic biospheroids (Becze-Déak et al., 1997) and passage features (Stoops, 2003). The latter

is suggested by the presence of implement marks, dusty clay and clay silt coatings, lenses of dusty humic material and randomly distributed and strongly fragmented waste elements (Courty et al., 1989; Simpson et al., 1998; 2005; Lewis, 2012; Devos et al., 2013a).

Looking more in detail we observed that for SU 872/057 anthropogenic elements are typically strongly fragmented and randomly distributed, phytoliths are mainly isolated and clustered (Fig. 4a and 4b), dusty, silty and layered clay coatings and lenses of dusty humic material are present, as well as numerous implement marks. Based on all this evidence SU 872/057 can be interpreted as an agricultural topsoil. The observation of articulated ELONGATE DENTATE/DENDRITIC deriving from cereal bracts supports this view (Fig. 7g). The observed articulated systems were not large enough to provide a further statistical confident taxonomical attribution.

SU 871/237 stands out by its calcareous matrix, the abundance of anthropogenic remains and traces of soil working, suggesting the presence of an intensively worked garden/backyard (see for instance Devos et al., 2013a; 2017; Wouters et al., 2019). This is further sustained by the phytolith data that show not only a clear decrease in the amount of phytoliths observed, but also of the clustered pattern ending in a more marked prevalence of isolated phytoliths (Fig. 4a and b). Similar observations have been made on other garden contexts (see for instance Devos et al., 2013a; 2017; Wouters et al., 2019).

Under the microscope a sharp boundary is observed between SU 871 and SU 870. This is supported by the presence of horizontally deposited archaeological material (Fig. 8a). A second discontinuity is noted between SU 870 and SU 869. Also at this border horizontally deposited material can be observed. Part of them seems to be trampled in, thus suggesting a surface that has been walked upon (Fig. 8d) (see for instance Rentzel et al., 2017; Karkanas & Goldberg, 2019). Both SU 870 and SU 869 are particularly rich in burned construction remains (burned limestone and mortar fragments) (Fig. 8h), burned soil fragments and charcoal. As such, they might reflect the dump of building material after

a fire event, rather than hearth rake-out. The observation of the microscopic sharp boundaries indicates that the Dark Earth, despite the abundant traces of bioturbation, did not reach its full maturity here (e.g. complete homogenisation, see for instance Macphail, 2010).

# 5. Mundaneum Dark Earth formation

Previous studies have demonstrated that the processes of Dark Earth formation are site dependent. It is therefore important to understand the major processes involved in the formation of each individual Dark Earth (Macphail, 1994; Heimdahl, 2005; Devos et al., 2009; 2011; Borderie, 2011; Devos, 2019).

For the Mundaneum site major natural processes include bioturbation, sedimentation, humification, alkalinisation and clay translocation. These natural processes are often human induced.

Bioturbation, by both fauna and flora, plays a major role in the creation of the macroscopic homogeneous Dark Earth. Main evidence includes the presence of organo-mineral excremental aggregates (Fig. 6c) and sparitic biospheroids (Fig. 7b), both pointing to the presence of common earthworms (see Becze-Déak et al., 1997; Canti, 2017; Kooistra & Pulleman, 2018). Further evidence includes the many root galleries, and for SU 873 the presence of mole galleries. As mentioned earlier, this process of bioturbation is enhanced by human actions, in particular the manuring of an initially chemically poor sandy sediment. Sedimentation, in the form of colluviation is another major natural factor in the creation of the thick urban Dark Earth. Its presence reveals the presence of unprotected surfaces (roads, crop fields, etc.) upslope (see for instance French, 2017).

Humification of the organic remains plays also an important role in the creation of the thick organo-mineral Dark Earth. Together with the fragmentation of the charcoal and charred bone fragments (Fig. 6d) through intense biological activity, they explain the dark colour of the Dark Earth.

The disintegration of the accumulated calcareous materials such as mortar, ash, bone and shells render the middle and upper part of the Dark Earth more alkaline (Howard, 2017; Prokofieva et al., 2021). Finally, the presence of many lenses of dusty humic material, dusty clay and clay silt coatings (Fig. 6e) results from the physical slumping of the surface leading to downward movement of the finer particles (see for instance Macphail et al., 1990; French, 2003).

Human alterations include mixing of the topsoil, truncation, trampling (Fig. 8d) and the accumulation of different types of waste: incremental (Fig. 6g, h, i, Fig. 7d and f), construction (Fig. 7e, Fig. 8h and Fig. 8i), artisanal (Fig. 8c, d, e and f) and household waste (Fig. 6d, Fig. 7h, i and Fig. 8g).

Although a macroscopic homogeneous Dark Earth was formed on the site of Mundaneum, detailed field and micromorphological observations permitted to discern several horizons. As discussed previously, the bioturbation and human activities (tillage and gardening) lead to the erasing of the initial stratigraphy at a macroscopic level. At a microscopic level, relics of the build-up of the Dark Earth could still be recognised, as demonstrated by the identification of a succession of different human activities. The random distribution of the larger anthropogenic elements and stones further indicates that the Dark Earth is not the result of the creation of one isotropic biomantle or

faunalmantle (see for instance Peacock & Fant, 2002; Johnson et al., 2005), but rather an episodic alternation of sediment accretion and subsequent homogenisation resulting from bioturbation (earthworms, moles and roots) and human activities (tillage/gardening). Its anomalous thickness results from the addition of colluvium, manuring practices and for the later phases dumping of artisanal waste and construction/destruction debris.

# 6. Archaeological implications

The micromorphological study not only permitted the authors to identify a series of activities that are seldom recorded with traditional archaeological approaches, focussing on archaeological structures and artefacts. It also allows to detail their chronological order and, importantly, it also permits to define phases of continuity and change (Wouters, 2020). As such, following biography of the Dark Earth can be proposed (Fig. 9):

The oldest phase of Dark Earth formation (14th century or older – 15th century) on top of a truncated Retisol witnesses a rural environment with prevailing agricultural activities. The soil was tilled and intensively manured to improve its fertility. The phytolith analysis confirms the cultivation of cereal crops. The Dark Earth thickens due to colluviation, suggesting agricultural activities upslope, and phases witnessing more intense bioturbation (including intense mole, earthworm and root activity) may reflect a temporary change of soil cover into grasslands. In the next phase (15th-16th century CE) the area seems to become more closely incorporated in the urban tissue as witnessed by a major reorganisation of the area, with evidence for building activity and metal production in the vicinity. A waste pit related to a cutlery workshop dating from this period was discovered on the north-western part of the site. All this aligns well with the research of Jan de Vries who calculated urban density around 1500 in the Low Countries (de Vries, 1984). He states that the rural county of Hainaut, including Mons, is less urbanised in relationship to the southern Low Countries around this time. In addition, he points out that Mons was still to transform in a highly urbanized town from 1500 onwards based on industrial textile production and the processing of stone and metal (Blockmans et al., 2018).

In the 16th-17th century CE the central part of the site is transformed into a garden/yard plot. In this respect we can also refer to the discovery of build structures from this period in the northwestern part of the site (Loicq & Sornasse, 2014). These observations are consistent with the organisation of the urban blocks illustrated on the map of Braun & Hogenberg (1581). The transformation in the 17th century of the use of the space towards an intensively trampled area, in combination with the presence of construction fillings and burnt remains, timidly but surely translates the periods of destruction and reconstruction linked to the incessant changeover of the town from Spanish to French and even Austrian regimes. The confirmation of the use of the intra-block space, as a dumping ground within a fallow land induces the postponement of cultivation activities and food production outside the district from the end of the 17th century at the latest. According to the iconographic sources, this trend seems to have been gradual for the whole town during the 18th century and especially in the following century.

Fig. 9. Reconstruction of the build-up of the Dark Earth of the Mundaneum site.

# 7. Conclusions

The integration of micromorphology and phytolith analysis conducted on the site of Mundaneum (Mons, Belgium) enabled the authors to detail the formation processes involved in the creation of a thick urban Dark Earth, showing the importance of both human actions (including the accumulation of different types of waste, mixing of the topsoil, truncation and trampling) and natural – often human induced – processes (bioturbation, sedimentation, humification, alkalinisation and clay translocation). This is a necessary step to establish part of the sites' previously unknown biography. By detailing the evolution from an (open) rural to a more urban character of the site, the study of the urban Dark Earth also contributes to the understanding of the progressing urbanisation of the area. Phytoliths proved to be an important witness of the presence of plant material, in a context where organic remains tend to decompose rapidly. The study of the phytoliths in thin sections further permitted to come to a better understanding of their taphonomical history, hence permitting to distinguish plant remains related to manure, cereal processing and cultivation. Beyond illustrating the evolution on a site level, the study of the Dark Earth of the Mundaneum site also informed on human impact in the larger surroundings. Present research thus provides an important precedent to the further geoarchaeological study of the historical centre of Mons.

Through this example it is clearly demonstrated that the integrated approach developed for the study of buried urban Anthrosols and Technosols - in casu urban Dark Earth - provides crucial data to come to an understanding of town development and its impact on soil formation.
