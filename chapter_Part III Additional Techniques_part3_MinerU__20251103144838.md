Figure 31.9 Prepared burning surfaces. (a) A thin section from the constructed substrate of a Neolithic hearth (Turkey). The hearth is paved with fragments of basalt (ba) and mudbrick (mb). The mudbrick fragments are rubified and cracked, likely as a result of heating. Box indicates the location of (b) and (c). Incident light. (b) At magnification, ashes are visible between the basalt and the mudbrick (arrow). PPL. (c) Same view as (b), XPL. The edges of the vesicular basalt fragment are scalloped in morphology and contain coatings of mudbrick (arrow). The mudbrick coating juxtaposed against the ash-filled crack indicates that the mudbrick was pressed against the basalt while it was still wet, and the crack formed at a later point. (d) A low magnification panoramic image of a hearth that contains at least two burnt residue layers, the upper associated with a prepared substrate. The lower hearth (BR1) is filled with ashes sourced from both wood (BR1a) and dung (BR1b). A large fragment of heated mudbrick (mb) is also visible. The substrate of the lower hearth was not sampled. The lower hearth is capped with a layer of plaster that provided the substrate (CS2) for the upper hearth, which also contains burnt materials (BR2). Neolithic, Turkey. PPL. (e) Photomicrograph of the plaster substrate, CS2. The plaster layer is overlain by wood ashes that, like BR1, contain inclusions of rubbed mudbrick (mb). PPL (f) Same view as (e), XPL. The plaster is calcareous and contains inclusions of volcanic glass.

Pit structures involve excavation of the substrate (see Figure 31.8d) and burial of the ignited fuel in order to facilitate combustion under reducing conditions. Thus, the resulting combustion feature is characterized by burnt residues filling a depression with a concave combustion substrate whose fabric depends on the nature of the excavated ground (natural soil, sediment, occupation surface, diverse stratified succession, etc.). Micromorphological descriptions of the content and substrate of several large pit fires from Hayonim Cave can be found in Meignen et al. (2007). By nature of their life histories, which include intentional excavation and removal of burnt materials, some degree of reworking will always be present in these features. For example, micromorphological analysis of a cooking pit fire from an abandoned Hadza camp (Tanzania) showed the presence of sediment rip-up clasts derived from the scooping out of ashes (MalloI et al. 2007). Likewise, charcoal burning pits documented by Zerboni et al. (2013: Figure 2) exhibit both intact and disturbed areas.

The function of pit features may be reconstructed based on morphology and the presence of inclusions. Some types of pit features can function as simple kilns. For example, experimental lime 'pit kilns' documented

by Goren & Goring-Morris (2008) lack constructed walls. Micromorphological samples of these features contain partially burnt limestone rock fragments. Berna et al. (2007) also documented the presence of a copper casting pit at the site of Tel Dor. Micromorphological analyses of the feature, which indicated the presence of rubified sediment, charcoal, glass, and phytoliths, were supplemented by FTIR analyses of the sediments and elemental analyses, the latter which indicated high concentrations of copper. Roasting pits and their inclusions have been sampled and described by Goldberg (2000: Figure 7).

Fire installations are the most morphologically and structurally complicated forms of contained combustion features. Like destruction layers, the first step in the analysis of fire installations is their observation in the field. Fire installations can be produced from a wide variety of materials (see Gur-Arieh et al. 2014), and can have highly variable morphologies. Micromorphological analyses of these features and nearby architectural elements can aid in understanding how firing occurred, which types of fuels were used, how the structures were maintained, and in some cases, their function. For example, Gur-Arieh et al. (2014) used micromorphological

observations of altered substrates and walls to determine whether the structures were internally or externally fuelled. Matthews (2010: Figure 3) observed the presence of two types of fuels (wood and dung) as well as heated materials sourced from the walls and ceiling of a Neolithic oven. Elsewhere within the site, these materials are also present in rake-out deposits in middens, which implies that the reworked materials source from ovens (Shillito & Matthews 2013). In other contexts, Matthews has observed ochre inside ovens and in rake out, which she interprets as ritual use of the features (Matthews 2005). She has also utilized micromorphological analyses of oven walls to understand their history of construction and rebuilding, including multiple layers of plaster that indicate refurbishing of the surfaces. Analyses of nearby walls can be informative about the conditions of burning and the environment within the structures when installations are located in enclosed spaces. For example, Goodman-Elgar (2008: Figure 8f) illustrates the microscopic characteristics of soot layers on mudbrick walls located near an interior cooking installation.

The function(s) of fire installations may be reconstructed by the presence of inclusions (metal slag, ceramic fragments, lime lumps, etc.) combined with the feature context (domestic versus nondomestic). For example, Ismail-Meyer et al. (2013) identified a ceramic firing area on the basis of micromorphological samples that contained abundant charcoal mixed with both unburnt clay and materials used as temper. Finally, Angelucci (2008: Figure 7) documents micromorphological characteristics of a Roman cremation furnace, which include the composition of the mud-brick walls, and the presence of ashes and burnt bones inside.

# 31.6 Stratigraphy and Fabric of Physically Reworked Combustion Structures

Combustion features that have been physically reworked – either through human action or nonhuman processes – can be highly variable in morphology. Their depositional histories, including the agent and degree of reworking, may be inferred from morphology in the field and aspects of microscopic fabric and structure. Features that are reworked by geological and biological processes can be used to understand processes that likely impacted other materials at the site, as well as aspects of the local environment. In contrast, human reworking can be exceptionally informative about structuring of activities, cleaning and maintenance of the site, or storage and utilization of byproducts of combustion (Mentzer 2014). For example, using composition, fabric, and structure,

micromorphologists have documented reworked combustion features such as ash dumps (Goldberg et al. 2009), ash storage containers (Matthews 2010, Milek 2012); and utilization of ashes in plaster (Mentzer & Quade 2013: Figure 3), in agriculture (Huisman et al. 2012) and as a cleaning product and byre bedding additive (Milek 2012).

In the field, archaeologists often hypothesize that features are reworked when combustion residues are present but internal stratigraphy is absent (Schiegl et al. 2003; Mentzer 2014). However, field identification can be difficult. For example, at Tabun C (Israel), combustion features that displayed visible layering reminiscent of in situ combustion features exhibited micromorphological characteristics suggestive of extensive reworking (Albert et al. 1999).

The distance over which combustion residues can be reworked and redistributed is variable, from several millimetres or less, to several meters or more. Sherwood (2008) calls deposits that have been reworked at the location where they were burned 'mixed burned deposits'. Mentzer (2014) suggests that small-scale reworking of combustion features may be indicated by an increase in porosity or the presence of larger voids relative to the typical packing voids exhibited in intact hearths (e.g., Mallol et al. 2007). Dibble et al. (2009) also suggest that some fine materials within combustion features can be subjected to gravitational settling, which would redistribute combustion residues within a feature over a few millimetres or centimetres.

# 31.6.1 Geological Reworking

Combustion residues that have been reworked by higher energy processes may display characteristics such as rounding or laminations and textural sorting (Figure 31.10).

Water and wind activity removes certain burned components and sorts the remainder by size and density. These effects can be visible in thin section. Goldberg (2001) reported rounded fragments of charcoal within laminated Middle Palaeolithic deposits in Kebara (Israel) and interpreted these deposits as having formed through low-energy flowing water. Similarly, Araujo et al. (2008) report laminated, and likely waterlain ashes from the Paleoindian site of Lapa das Bolieras (Brazil). At Dust Cave (USA) Homsey & Capo (2006) and Sherwood (2001) reported charcoal 'stringers' which exhibited textural sorting, grading and the absence of silt-sized components, likely indicative of reworking by water. At Obi-Rakhmat (Uzbekistan) Mallol et al. (2009) used the presence of redoximorphic features and a matrix composed of 'clotted' calcite to infer that combustion residues had been reworked by spring activity. Some of

the finer grained combustion residues documented at this site were contained in laminated silty clay coatings and infillings (Figure 31.10a). Finally, Villagran et al. (2011) have investigated the effects of low-energy water flow on combustion residues in an experimental context.

Deposits associated with colluvial and slope processes typically lack the textural sorting and fine laminations found in water-lain or aeolian deposits. Rather, these deposits exhibit a more heterogenous composition, and can display key micromorphological characteristics, such as grain rounding and coating (Miller 2015). In colluvial systems, combustion residues and components behave as other sedimentary components within the deposit, and therefore will often be intimately mixed with geogenic materials (Figure 31.10b). In aeolian systems, the ash might be blown away, while denser components of the burnt residue layer may remain in situ or be slightly translocated and later incorporated into the underlying substrate through by trampling or sedimentation (Figure 31.10c).

Cryoturbation can also influence the preservation of combustion features. Given that ash is typically composed of silt-sized grains of micritic calcite, one can expect, following Van Vliet-Lanoë (2010) that platy and lenticular microstructures and cappings will develop when ash-rich combustion features are subjected to freeze-thaw processes (Figure 31.10d). Coarser components of combustion features, such as sand- and gravel-sized fragments of charcoal, burnt bone, or even cemented ashes, can exhibit rounding and also the development of stratified cappings around the grains (van Vliet-Lanoë 2010: Figures 9a and 15b). In Hohe Fels (Germany) Goldberg et al. (2003) and Schiegl et al. (2003) report rounded, sand-sized fragments of burnt and unburnt bones, some of which exhibit stratified coatings, which they interpret as evidence of cryoturbation of dumped, burnt materials.

# 31.6.2 Biological Reworking

Biological reworking of combustion features results in the formation of microscopic characteristics typical of bioturbation (Figure 31.11), such as filled biogalleries or burrows (Figure 31.11a), faecal pellets (Figure 31.11b), some of which can contain combustion residues (Wattez 1992; Albert et al. 1999; Goldberg et al. 2009), extensive homogenization, granular structure (Figure 31.11c), and the presence of channels or channel microstructure. Feeding activities may also lead to loss of some burnt materials. Charcoal fragments (typically smaller than two mm) are a food source for earthworms (Ponge et al. 2006; Topoliantz & Ponge 2005). Bioturbation does not always influence different portions of the same combustion

feature equally (Figure 31.11d). Differential bioturbation of ashes relative to charcoal may result when certain burrowing animals avoid ashy, alkaline deposits. Similarly, when ashy lens become cemented, they can prove to be impenetrable to burrowing animals (Mentzer 2014). Finally, larger animals have been known to excavate and disturb combustion features, either as a result of denning activities, or during scavenging of food items (Camaros et al. 2013). The signatures of these types of behaviours have not been studied using micromorphology; however, it is likely that some animal disturbances could appear similar to human activities such as sweeping and rake out (see below, section 31.6.3).

# 31.6.3 Human Reworking

Following use of a fire, humans can intentionally or unintentionally redistribute the burnt residues (Figure 31.12), a process that has been relatively well studied from a micromorphological perspective. Open hearths that lack prepared substrates may be situated in close proximity to, or overlapping with, other activity areas. Therefore these features can be subject to passive reworking, such as trampling, or active reworking as a result of maintenance. Experiments by Miller et al. (2010) subjected open hearths to rake out, dumping and trampling. The experimenters noted that raking led to textural sorting of the removed materials, since larger fragments of burnt bone and charcoal remained in the hearth, whereas the finer-grained ash, charcoal and burnt bone were redeposited. Raked-out materials exhibited an open microstructure, while the scooped and dumped deposits also showed open microstructures, but comprised a wider range of grain sizes compared to the better sorted, raked-out deposit. The experimenters concluded that these characteristics may vary in different archaeological contexts and therefore it may be difficult to distinguish between sweeping and dumping on the basis of micromorphological characteristics alone. Rather, they suggested that proximity of combustion residues to a rubified or altered substrate may possibly help determine if a combustion feature was raked out, or if it was swept out and dumped. Comparable results were obtained in experiments conducted by Mallol et al. (2013b). However, Meignen et al. (2007) suggest that hearth rake out can be identified by larger fragments of combusted materials (and also possibly nonburnt materials) that are heterogeneously dispersed and that exhibit a roughly horizontal orientation. Likewise, Homsey & Capo (2006) argue that the presence of horizontal charcoal stringers implies hearth rake out, assuming that this activity took place before complete combustion of the fuel. They contrast this to ash dumps, which they argue would have taken place after complete combustion.

Schiegl et al. (2003) identified a Gravettian midden-like deposit of dumped, burnt bone on the basis of the following characteristics: subrounded, sand-sized grains of burnt and unburnt bone, which were adjacent to one another; lack of a heat-altered substrate; clear bedding with some beds and lenses containing mostly burnt bone, and others containing unburnt bone; high porosity of the deposit; and general lack of evidence for compaction or in situ snapping or crushing of bone. Extensive ash dumps identified using similar characteristics have been reported from other Middle and Upper Palaeolithic contexts (Goldberg 2001; Goldberg 2003; Meignen et al. 2007).

Trampling (Figure 31.12a) can also impact the fabric and structure of combustion features, through horizontal

and vertical displacement of combusted materials, compaction of combustion features, and snapping and crushing of burnt bone (see also Figure 31.8a and b; Miller et al. 2010; Mallol et al. 2013b; Miller et al. 2013).

The process of human reworking of materials from constructed features has also been studied at a variety of sites. Constructed features, which include prepared surfaces and installations, if used frequently will require regular cleaning. Evidence of cleaning activities may be found in dumped materials in urban middens. In these settings, observations of the type of fuel as well as inclusions of heated mudbrick and plaster can be used to determine their source. Furthermore, the fabric and structure, in particular the porosity and orientation of inclusions, can provide information about the relationship

of dumping areas to other activities (see Figure 31.12d and e; Matthews 2010; Shillito & Matthews 2013). Matthews (2010) notes that swept and trampled materials from installations, like those from open hearths, exhibit size sorting and fragmentation, and also contain few articulated phytoliths. Alternatively, burnt materials removed from installations may be utilized for other purposes, such as fertilizing fields (Huisman et al. 2012); for producing a variety of materials that include lye, soap, glass, and plaster (Mentzer & Quade 2013); or as absorbents of odour and moisture in rooms and stables

(Milek 2012). In the latter example, intentional dumping or spreading of ashes on floors can generate thick layers of reworked materials that later become compacted and develop platy structure as a result of human foot traffic (Milek 2012: Figure 6). Burnt materials removed from constructed features may be used directly, or stored for later use. According to Milek (2012), thin sections from an ethnohistorical ash storage area contained discrete layers of ashes of different type. Ash storage bins have also been described by Matthews (2010). Finally, in some cases, the source and mode of anthropogenic reworking

may be difficult to establish. In a multianalytical study at Tel Dor, Berna et al. (2007) documented the presence of reworked material, evidenced in thin section by inclusions of clay crusts that are randomly oriented, paired with high temperature mineral phases that indicated a probable source from an oven or other type of industrial setting.

# 31.7 Microscopic Evidence for Chemical Diagenesis of Intact and Reworked Combustion Structures

Most combustion features encountered in archaeological sites have undergone some degree of chemical diagenesis. Indeed, the formation of calcite in ashes from calcium oxide is a form of chemical diagenesis that occurs within combustion features following burning. Only combustion features in highly arid conditions escape this process. In all other settings, the type and degree of diagenesis is dependent on the parent materials, as well as aspects of the substrate, overburden, and groundwater, including dissolved components and pH. Diagenesis can occur syndepositionally or postdepositionally, especially when combustion features are on or near the ground surface. Deep and rapid burial minimizes ongoing alteration, and therefore evidence for diagenesis can be informative about past environmental and chemical conditions within the site. Diagenetic processes can remove materials, alter or replace materials, or introduce new minerals to combustion features.

Careful observation of each of these types of processes can lead to further interpretation of the significance of diagenesis in terms of the preservation of other archaeological materials and environmental conditions following models provided by Karkanas et al. (2000) and Karkanas (2010).

# 31.7.1 Mineral Removal

Chemical removal of minerals and other substances from combustion features occurs when acidic or alkaline waters percolate through the site as a result of rainfall, dripwater, or groundwater activity.

Calcite dissolution impacts in particular the ash component of combustion features (Figure 31.13). Relative to other calcareous materials in archaeological sites, ashes are especially susceptible to dissolution under acidic conditions due to their high surface to bulk ratio (Friesem et al. 2014b). This process may be recognized in thin section by the overall absence of ashes with the exception of localized preservation in sheltered areas (Figure 31.13a–c)

or dissolution of more resistant forms of carbonate (Figure 31.13d).

Silica dissolution occurs under alkaline conditions (Fraysse et al. 2009; Cabanes et al. 2011). Like calcareous ashes, the phytolith component of ashes is also differentially impacted by silica dissolution relative to other siliceous materials due to their high surface area and initially disorganized (opaline) crystal structure. Remnants of dissolved phytoliths may be one type of material termed 'siliceous aggregates' that are recognized in thin section by their porous structure and optical characteristics (Figure 31.13e and f; see also Schiegl et al. 1996).

# 31.7.2 Mineral Replacement

Replacement of burnt materials is evidenced in combustion features by calcite recrystallization and secondary phosphatization. Calcite recrystallization occurs under high moisture conditions with neutral to basic pH. Illustrations of different stages of this process are provided in Figure 31.14 (see also Bergadà et al. 2013: Figure 8d; Shahack-Gross et al. 2014: Figure 5d, e). Cementation is evidenced by welding of individual aggregates into a lithified mass (Figure 31.14a, c), while recrystallization results in variable loss of morphological definition of the rhombic aggregates. Although the morphologies of the individual ashes may be lost, overall fabric, including laminations or the presence of woody tissues, is preserved (Figure 31.14d; also Mentzer 2014: Figure 13b).

Secondary phosphatization occurs under high moisture conditions in the presence of a source of phosphorus, such as guano. The process is evidenced by precipitation of phosphatic minerals such as apatite in the form of nodules or crusts (Figure 31.15a and b). More advanced stages of phosphatization may be evidenced by either complete dissolution of ashes (Karkanas & Goldberg 2010: Figure 2) or their volumetric replacement by phosphate minerals, as well as recrystallization of bone inclusions (Karkanas & Goldberg 2010: Figure 1). These types of transformations are best identified using additional analyses, such as micro-FTIR (Figure 31.15d, but see Karkanas 2010 for examples of some minerals in thin section). Charcoal decomposition can occur under high moisture conditions and high pH (Cohen-Ofri et al. 2006). This process has been documented in Holocene agricultural soils and the replacement of charcoal by clay with preservation of the original morphology has been reported (see Huisman et al. 2012: Figure 6).

Secondary mineral formation, which results in material gains to combustion features may also impact their preservation. For example, the precipitation of other

minerals, in particular secondary salts, can cause mechanical fracturing of charcoal (Figure 31.15e and f).

# 31.8 Synthesis

The final step in analysis of combustion features using micromorphology is synthesis of the observations. Figure 31.16 illustrates the synthesis of analyses of a simple open hearth with a prepared burning surface. In this example, the form and pavements were clear in the field (Figure 31.16a), and the context was a domestic interior space; however, other aspects of the function were

unknown. Based on micromorphological analyses of the burnt residues, possible functions and fuel sources were identified (Figure 31.16b,c). In a more complicated sequence (Figure 31.17), additional analytical tools were necessary to reconstruct the life history of the combustion feature. Namely, the microfacies concept (Courty 2001) aided in the classification of different microstratigraphic units by composition, fabric and structure. These characteristics also aided in associating each microfacies type with depositional and postdepositional processes. Furthermore, the same microfacies units, when identified throughout a site, can be used to understand vertical and lateral variation in different, recurring processes,

including human activities. In this example, ashy sediments are interbedded with red geogenic sediment (Figure 31.17a). The sequence can be divided into units comprising three main microfacies types (Figure 31.17 b-g). Next, the discrete characteristics of each unit can be interpreted in terms of anthropogenic or geogenic primary depositional processes, with variable degrees of secondary cementation and reworking by insects and downslope movement. The final synthesis (Figure 31.17h) reveals that two intact hearths are each overlain by geogenic deposits.

# 31.9 Conclusion

Combustion structures are among the most commonly occurring anthropogenic (and rarely, nonanthropogenic) features in archaeological sites from all regions and almost all time periods. Yet, micromorphological analyses of combustion features have not been conducted on a systematic basis. Most published studies relate to open hearths in Palaeolithic contexts, or experimental and ethnographic studies that are pertinent to their interpretation. Only in Palaeolithic settings are micromorphological analyses considered to be a standard avenue of investigation for combustion features and pyrotechnological behaviour. In contrast, with the exception of fumiers and to some extent, features in Near Eastern tells, there are few systematic studies of combustion features from recent prehistoric or historic periods. This lack of focus is surprising given the common occurrence of kiln remains and the ubiquity of industrial ceramic, metallurgic and glass production reported in the literature. Likewise, experimental replication of pyrotechnologies, such as pottery and glass production and metal smelting, and material analysis of their byproducts are numerous, while the discarded remains of the fire installations themselves receive little interest.

In the future, micromorphological research on combustion structures would benefit from more experimental and ethnoarchaeological work that could provide middle range datasets for interpretation of combustion feature compositions and microfabrics. We suggest expanding upon previous analyses of open hearths and the effects of postdepositional human actions on them (trampling, sweeping, rake out, etc.), as well as other types of combustion structures, including earth ovens and industrial kilns. Ethnoarchaeological research would be particularly useful to reconstruct the impacts of taphonomic agents on combustion features in a wider range of environmental settings. Finally, the microstratigraphic investigation of combustion structures should be carried out using a multitechnique approach.

Figure 31.17 Combustion feature life histories. (a) A sequence of stacked combustion features (UP, Turkey) present a more complicated formation sequence. Here, the microfacies concept (Courty 2001) was applied in order to relate the formation of these features to other features within the site. The three main microfacies types (MF-I, MF-II, and MF-V) are indicated on the left side of the panoramic composite image of the sequence (subtypes indicated by lowercase letters and numbers relate to fabric/structure and degree of cementation; see Mentzer 2011). Localized domains of additional microfacies subtypes are also labelled. (b) MF-IIa2 is characterized by massive ashes that are variably cemented, yet preserve local rhombic aggregates (arrow), laminations and plant tissues that indicate that they are in place. MF1 is interpreted as the burnt ashy residue layer of an intact open hearth. PPL. (c) The lower unit of MF-IIa2 contains a fragment of bone, which has not been heated above  $550^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , as indicated by  $\mu$ -FTIR measurements conducted directly on the thin section (inset). XPL. (d) A passage feature (arrow) in the upper unit of MF-IIa2 indicates that the ashes have been impacted by postdepositional bioturbation. The fabric of the layer, but not its overall composition, has been affected. The uppermost portion of the underlying unit of MF-lb2 is visible at the base of the image. This portion of the unit varies in colour, with the uppermost sedimentary aggregates (SA) appearing dark red in PPL. (e) In another area, insect bioturbation has impacted both the fabric and composition, as well as the structure of the layer. PPL. This burrow contains faecal pellets composed of ashes mixed with red clay, as well as rounded aggregates of cemented ashes (inset; XPL). This sediment is classified as MF-IIc2, a bioturbation subfacies with localized cementation. (f) MF-lb2 is characterized by geogenic sediment composed of red clay with inclusions of quartz silt. Cementation by secondary calcite is variable and is expressed either as diffuse matrix impregnation or as void coatings (arrow) and infillings. MF-lb2 is interpreted as the dominant geogenic sedimentation regime in the site. (g) MF-Vd2 is characterized by mixed aggregates of geogenic and anthropogenic sediment, including rounded aggregates of cemented ashes, dark and light red clay aggregates, randomly oriented clay curls (CC), and rounded, sand-sized fragments of unburnt bones (b). MF-Vd2 is interpreted as colluvial material containing geogenic and anthropogenic components in secondary position with variable secondary cementation. (h) The final interpretation of this sample is as a sequence of two intact open hearths interbedded with geogenic materials, including a colluvial deposit. The burnt residues and combustion substrates are overlain on the panoramic image shown in (a). The lower hearth is overlain by a thin geogenic deposit of red clay aggregates that form the combustion substrate for the upper hearth, as evidenced by the darkened aggregates in (d). The upper hearth is impacted by postdepositional bioturbation, and is locally truncated and overlain by a colluvial deposit containing reworked combustion materials. The colluvial deposit is in turn capped by a geogenic layer that has been partially cemented by secondary calcite. The functions of the hearths are unknown, as inclusions within them are rare, save for a single fragment of bone.

Integration of micromorphology with other high resolution techniques, including micro-FTIR (Berna & Goldberg 2008; Berna et al. 2012), XRF (Mentzer & Quade 2013), organic petrology (Taylor et al. 1998;

Ligouis 2006) and organic chemistry (Sistiaga et al. 2014) will provide robust datasets that will contribute towards a broader understanding of archaeological combustion features.

# 32.1 Introduction

The expression 'dark earth' does not correspond to a soil classification name nor should it imply a unequivocal archaeological interpretation. The term refers to darkcoloured, poorly stratified, nonpeaty material containing anthropogenic remains. More specifically, the expression 'dark earth' is often used to address thick units found in Roman or post-Roman urban contexts observed predominantly, if not exclusively, in Europe (on the geographical distribution of dark earth see Nicosia et al. 2013; Borderie et al. 2014). It should not be confused with black chernozemic soils of Central Europe (see for example Gerlach et al. 2006) or with 'Amazonian dark earth' or 'Terra Preta do Indios' (see Arroyo-Kalin 2017, this book; Lehmann et al. 2003). For a detailed discussion on the definition of European 'dark earth' the reader is referred to Macphail (1994), Macphail et al. (2003), Galinié (2004), Devos et al. (2009), Fondrillon (2009), and Nicosia & Devos (2014).

In the soil micromorphological literature, studies concerning European dark earth or dark layers or black soil appeared in Britain since the beginning of the 1980s (Macphail 1981, 1983; Macphail & Courty 1985). In Italy, where the expression terre nere appeared during the 1980s (Brogiolo et al. 1988; Brogiolo 2011), micromorphology has been employed in Ferrara (Cremaschi 1992; Cremaschi & Nicosia 2010), Firenze (Nicosia et al. 2012), and Padova (Nicosia et al. 2017). In France, micromorphological studies on terres noires date back to the early 1990s (Cammas et al. 1995; Cammas 2004); other studies were carried out by Gebhardt (1997), Borderie (2011), Borderie et al. (2014) and Macphail (2014). The earliest studies on dark earth in Belgium have been carried out since 1996, first in the city of Ghent (Ervynck et al. 1999; Stoops et al. 2001) and later on in Brussels (Devos et al. 2007, 2009, 2011a, 2013a, 2013b, 2016). In recent years, a

number of articles based on comparisons between dark earth contexts in different European countries were published (Macphail et al. 2003; Nicosia et al. 2013; Macphail 2014; Nicosia & Devos 2014; Borderie et al. 2014). These publications made large use of soil micromorphology to tackle interpretive problems in dark earth.

# 32.2 Sampling and Analytical Procedures

The micromorphological study of dark earth requires a specific sampling strategy (Figure 32.1). The homogeneous appearance of this type of material implies that most of the internal limits and discontinuities are obscured at the macroscopic scale. Therefore, continuous sampling of the whole sequence is recommended, possibly with partial overlapping of successive samples. Moreover, it is very important to record on the field the nature of the lower boundary of the dark earth, and to sample it alongside the underlying layer(s) or horizon(s). This allows for the comprehension of the type and rate of the processes involved in the initiation of dark earth formation (e.g., weathering of once-stratified archaeological layers such as walls and floors, slow accretion, massive dumping, mixing due to agricultural activities). Samples of the upper boundary will on the other hand reveal some of the postdepositional phenomena (e.g., erosion, truncation, pedogenesis), and possibly last use of space (e.g., herding on dark earth 'soils'; Macphail 2010). Given the marked lateral variability of dark earth, more than one profile should be described and sampled. Bulk samples for physico-chemical, botanical or microarchaeological analyses should be collected in close association with micromorphology samples (Figure 32.1). During sampling, care should be taken to note visibly bioturbated areas (e.g., tree-throws, large biogalleries), recognizable

Figure 32.1 Interdisciplinary field sampling, including pollen/ microfossil sampling in addition to Kubiana box and column for soil micromorphology (Roman amphitheatre - London Guildhall Yard East - see Macphail et al. 2008). Three arena floor/dark earth locations were sampled and studied in detail. Bulk chemical samples were subsampled from the monoliths in order to allow exact correlation between samples. Here, samples were taken through arena sands, the junction between the last constructional phase (mortar floor) and the earliest dark earth, and through late Roman dark earth up into the early medieval dark earth.

negative structures (e.g., pits, burials, robber trenches) and structures, such as walls, 'floating' in dark earth. All these associated contexts provide information on the continuity of landscape and use of space. 'Floating' archaeology, for example surfaces, may well provide insights into land use associated with dark earth formation, and should not be ignored (Galinié et al. 2007; Borderie et al. 2014). The sampling strategy and research questions should be decided together with the field archaeologists. In fact, they provide crucial contextual data and can direct the micromorphologist towards the most relevant or promising areas of the excavation.

The first step in dark earth thin section analysis is the identification of most evident differences and boundaries within each thin section set. Secondly, full standard descriptions according to reference terminologies (for instance Stoops 2003 or Bullock et al. 1985) should be made, the data being eventually organized into soil

microfabric types (Macphail & Cruise 2001; Cremaschi & Nicosia 2010). Thin section counting (e.g. visual estimate, point, single item or areal counting) can provide useful information. It should be taken into account that the interpretation should be based on the covariation in quantity of a set of different features and/or inclusions down the sequence, rather than just the variation of one single feature/inclusion.

Dark earth is the outcome of the interplay between human activities and natural syn- and postdepositional processes. These will be outlined below.

# 32.3.1 Features Associated with Secondary Mineral Formation

Pedofeatures observed in dark earth are mostly the outcome of the formation of carbonates, Fe/Mn (hydr) oxides and/or phosphates. The most common carbonate pedofeatures are typic calcite nodules and hypocoatings, the calcite deriving from the natural parent material (e.g. calcareous alluvium) or from dissolution of ashes, plaster or mortar (see Figure 32.2). In contexts where calcium carbonate cannot derive from the natural substratum, such neoformed minerals inform us about the disappearance of calcareous components formerly present in the deposit. This ultimately gives us information on the soil environment (e.g. water regime, acid or alkaline conditions). In the same way, Fe/Mn nodules, impregnations of the groundmass, hypo- and quasicoatings inform us

about the environmental conditions during or after dark earth formation. Moreover, Fe/Mn pseudomorphs of roots or other vegetal tissues and the staining of organic matter provide information on the organic matter status.

Secondary phosphates (see Figure 32.3a-e) commonly occur as crystal intergrowths, nodules, infillings of vivianite (indicator of waterlogged conditions), Ca or Ca-Fe phosphates. The formation of these pedofeatures is linked to the availability of phosphorus from the decomposition of plant materials, excrements, urine, ashes, bones or fish bones, or from phosphorus naturally present in the local soils.

Under certain circumstances, pedofeatures such as carbonate or phosphate nodules can be identified as being either in situ reworked by bioturbation or digging or additions associated with dumping or nightsoiling, for example. The input of new material into an accumulating dark earth deposit can also be recognized. For example, the addition of fresh/unweathered waste may be indicated by renewed earthworm activity evidenced by the presence of 'fresh' earthworm granules (compared to weathered ones), and better preserved and more diverse pollen types (compared to poorly preserved ruderal pollen typical of dark earth) (Scaife 1980; Greig 1982; Macphail & Cruise 1993; Macphail 2010). Where intensive occupation continues after the formation of dark earth, phosphate contamination may for example occur because of leakage from cesspits (Macphail & Linderholm 2004) or even from modern septic tanks. In such cases, an understanding of the archaeological context is crucial along with lateral controls.

# 32.3.2 Features Deriving from

# Biological Activities

One of the most characteristic features of dark earth is the high degree of bioturbation observable in thin section. Such process can be inferred from the thoroughly reworked fabric deriving from the development of root systems and/or from the activity of soil fauna such as moles, rodents, earthworms, ants and enchytraeids (Figure 32.4a and b). Specific traces are the formation of typical microstructures (e.g., basic ones given by organomineral excremental microaggregates, channel, granular or crumby microstructures), the presence of inorganic inclusions of biogenic origin (earthworm granules, slug plates) and of passage features (bowlike features, excrement infillings) (see Kooistra & Pulleman 2010). The activity of roots and soil fauna also results in the masking of the original stratification, by erasing boundaries and sedimentary structures and causing the random distribution of natural and anthropogenic components. Fragmentation of different eco- and artefacts is another byproduct of biological activity in the soil, especially

visible in the large quantity of finely comminuted charcoal, charred vegetal fragments (Figure 32.4a, b), and phytoliths (Figure 32.4c) dispersed in the groundmass of dark earth.

# 32.3.3 Weathering of Calcareous Materials (According to the Para-Rendzina Model of Macphail 1994)

According to the general explanatory model proposed by Macphail (Macphail 1994; Macphail et al. 2003), dark earth can be the outcome of the pedogenetic transformations acting on originally well-stratified urban archaeological deposits. The result is a 'soil' with characteristics similar to natural soils classified as calcareous Brown Earths or Para-Rendzinas (Duchaufour 1983), with the difference that in dark earth the calcareous parent material corresponds to mortar and plaster fragments derived from destruction, robbing and decay of buildings and monuments. As dark earth soil 'matures', humic and carbonic acids may partially decalcify biogenic calcite: such weathering features indicate the development of a stable land surface (see section 32.3.5). In this scenario, earthworm granules can display signs of being weakly weathered, showing a 'darkening' of their colours under PPL and the corrosion of their outer boundaries (Courty, et al. 1989). In the same way, the poor preservation of pollen grains, due to oxidation and biological activity can be used to detect weathering processes acting on dark earth (see Macphail 1981; Macphail & Cruise 1993).

# 32.3.4 Weathering of Earth-Based Construction Materials

Dark earth can form from the breakdown of earth-based building 'clay' or 'loam', such as loess (silt loam) and brickearth (fine sandy silt loam - see Goldberg & Macphail 2006), and from the decalcification of sand-tempered lime plaster and stone-tempered mortar (see Figure 32.2). Weathering can thus release clay, silt, sand, and gravel into dark earth, alongside calcium carbonate (often redeposited as hypocoatings down profile, for example; see Macphail & Courty 1985; Macphail 1994). Building debris can also contribute to the distributions of small artefact within dark earth, as revealed through microarchaeological analyses (Sidell 2000; Fondrillon 2009).

# 32.3.5 Soil Formation on Grassland, Pasture and Abandoned Areas

Part of the dark earth results from soil formation on grassland, pasture or abandoned areas in urban or proto-urban contexts. Typical features are enhanced organic matter, biogenic porosity and earthworm granules.

The latter can show traces of weathering and partial dissolution, which might be used as indicators of decalcification processes (see above). Phytoliths are mostly isolated or locally clustered (Figure 32.5), showing no preferential orientation and belonging mostly to the Pooidea grass subfamily (Macphail 1981; Devos et al., 2009, 2013a, 2013b). Pollen may also indicate pasture (Greig 1982, 2004). Compared to the substratum, only a slight accumulation of anthropogenic material may be noted. Stock concentrations have been indicated by the presence of herbivore dung (e.g. No. 1 Poultry and the Guildhall, London – Macphail et al. 2008; Figure 32.6). However, robust identification often requires the

combination of micromorphological data with physicochemical and microfossil (phytoliths, pollen) analyses (Macphail & Linderholm 2004; Devos et al. 2009, 2013a).

# 32.3.6 Natural Sedimentation and Erosion in Dark Earth Sequences

On some sites dark earth formation has lasted for several centuries (see for example Fedi et al. 2007; Cantini et al. 2008; Nicosia et al. 2012). Hence, in sites located within active alluvial settings, it is likely that alluvium became incorporated and homogenized within dark earth. Such mechanism has been identified for example in the site of

Corso Porta Reno in Ferrara (northern Italy - see Cremaschi & Nicosia 2010). Here, an alternating sequence of dark-coloured occupation deposits and cm-thick alluvium layers was not homogenized by bioturbation and anthropic activities, thus not ultimately resulting in dark earth. This was due to persisting waterlogged conditions and fast sedimentary accretion. The presence of 'flood coatings' (sensu Brammer 1971; Figure 32.7) can be regarded as another indicator of flooding during dark earth formation (as for example in

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/bedc544e-6532-4e7f-9c47-701c6e06b76e/a9373529d2413273d7720ae9ae03e0e81fc8364925abac7eb7b557a3d0e24b2e.jpg)

the site of the Uffizi gallery complex in Florence, Italy - see Nicosia et al. 2012). The decayed earth-based constructions of shortlived (ca. 100 years) late Antique Tarquimpol, France, were sealed by colluvium from the eroded surrounding ramparts (Macphail 2014).

Micromorphology alone does not always permit us to identify the natural input of new sediments (alluvium, colluvium or aeolian input) but it could be effectively coupled with particle size distribution index analysis (Langohr et al. 1976; Devos et al. 2009, 2013a, 2013b). In Macphail (2003) grain-size analysis was employed to distinguish inputs from weathering of building materials versus alluvium. Erosion, as well as truncation, can be hardly discerned relying solely on thin section analysis. It can be sometimes detected on the field when abrupt boundaries (e.g. in dark earth overlain by alluvium or by later construction units) are visible or when a 'gap' is revealed by high-resolution  $^{14}\mathrm{C}$  dating along the sequence (see for example Fedi et al. 2007; Nicosia et al. 2012).

# 32.4 Features Associated with Human Activities

# 32.4.1 Dumping In, and From, Different Activity Areas (e.g., Domestic House Sweepings, Industrial Residues, Latrine Waste)

Dumping is an activity commonly identified within dark earth. The latter has in fact often developed from midden deposits, for example in open areas or within abandoned house shells (see for example Macphail 1994;

Table 32.1 Typology and origin of dumped material commonly found in dark earth (based on Macphail 1994; Fondrillon 2007; Devos et al. 2011b).

Cammas 2000; Fondrillon 2007). Micromorphology can contribute to determining the origins of dumped materials (see Table 32.1). Domestic waste is generally the outcome of activities such as house sweeping, hearth functioning and maintenance, and food preparation. The maintenance and periodic emptying of cesspits and latrines implies the release of large quantities of phosphate-rich material, which can be used in conjunction with domestic waste for manuring purposes (see section 32.4.2). Construction and/or destruction rubble is often found in areas subjected to squatting or to the reuse of materials from pre-existing buildings. However, the presence of construction/destruction debris in dark earth is often due to the disintegration of derelict buildings. The waste resulting from metal production and working contains materials heated at high temperatures, generally higher than those encountered in domestic contexts (see Berna et al. 2007; Angelini et al. 2017, this book). Butchery and leather-working waste have been reported in Stoops et al. (2001) from the dark earth in the centre of Ghent, Belgium, and is a typical component at the London Guildhall (Macphail et al. 2008). Ubiquitous latrine and butchery waste dumping can be a response to the breakdown of urban regulations (Macphail 2010).

# 32.4.2 Cultivation and Manuring

In general, the micromorphological features on which cultivation in dark earth contexts is inferred are the same used in other ancient agricultural soils (see Deák et al. 2017, this book; Figure 32.8a and b). Cultivation is one of

the mechanisms that can aid the transformation of evident archaeological stratigraphy into dark earth, for example through horticulture after the Boudiccan rebellion (AD 60-61) at London and Colchester (Macphail 1994). Here, this was through horticultural 'double digging' where cultivation trenches were dug into destruction debris and mixed with dung. It is also the case that early medieval cultivation within once-urban areas can be recognized spatially alongside occupation, developing into viticulture. This is the case at St. Julien, Tours (eleventh century), where a homogeneous, totally bioturbated microfabric developed (Fondrillon 2007, 2009; Galinie et al. 2007). In England, examples of urban cultivation (Canterbury, Leicester) tend to be medieval in date, and soils, either homogenized by gardening or ploughed (major mixing and textural pedofeature formation), show far higher manuring inputs compared to Roman cultivated soils. They also record far higher levels of organic matter (determined by LOI), phosphate, and enhanced magnetic susceptibility resulting from the additions of domestic, latrine, and burnt waste (Goldberg & Macphail 2006, Table 9.1a; Macphail & Crowther 2007a, 2007b).

In Brussels, the identification of agricultural activities relies on the observation of traces witnessing thorough reworking of a topsoil (e.g., textural pedofeatures, absence of laminations - Figure 32.8a and b, highly fragmented, randomly distributed and unoriented anthropogenic inclusions - Figure 32.9). The phytolith study carried out directly on the thin sections (see Vrydaghs et al. 2017, this book) permitted the identification of several crop markers. Evidence for manuring is given by

the presence of anthropogenic materials (e.g. faecal material such as latrine waste and coprolites, charcoal, pottery - Figure 32.10a, b and c). This is confirmed by chemical data showing enhanced values of phosphorus, organic matter, and of exchangeable basic cations (Devos et al. 2009, 2011a, 2011b, 2013a).

# 32.4.3 Other Human Activities

Beside the activities described above, there are others that characterize the urban archaeological record and should be kept into account when dealing with

formation processes of dark earth. These correspond for example to soil extraction or quarrying, to the excavation of wall foundations, post holes, beam slots, robber trenches, pits, graves etc. (see Carver 1987). All of the above mentioned activities result in the mechanical reworking and homogenization of the deposit, but their visibility is often very limited in the field. For example, negative structures filled with dark earth-like material can be visible when they cut through underlying layers or the natural substratum, their upper boundaries 'disappearing' into the dark earth layer. In the same way, clusters of archaeological materials (e.g. potsherds, slags, brick fragments) or even human remains often appear to 'float' in dark earth, without a clearly identifiable negative structure boundary. The presence of graves in once-urban space is another clue to indicate the breakdown in urban regulations. Such Late Roman burials were recorded at the Courage Brewery site, Southwark, London and Deansway, Worcester (Cowan 2003; Dalwood & Edwards 2004).

Thin sections can be of little help in distinguishing between these different activities resulting in dark earth reworking and homogenization. In general, the backfill of these structures can present a loose, well-separated microstructure, reflecting the dumping process. The latter is also testified by the juxtaposition of reworked aggregates with different origins (e.g. natural substratum, dark earth-like materials, other stratigraphic units). The presence of traces of bioturbation suggests that soil fauna and roots preferentially drill through the loose backfill.

# 32.5 Concluding Remarks

The lack of internal stratification of dark earth at the macroscale is particularly problematic for urban archaeologists since it clashes with the concept of 'one stratigraphic unit equals one action' (Harris 1989). However, soil micromorphology has proven that, in many cases, dark earth represents a palimpsest of different activities and natural processes, which can still be identified despite dark earth often being subjected to thorough homogenization. Although soil micromorphology has

proven a powerful tool in elucidating the use of space and the cultural activities associated with dark earth formation, its combination with other analytical methods is advocated. Specifically, thin-section study can be integrated with soil physico-chemical analyses, instrumental analyses (e.g. electron microprobe, SEM/EDS - see Wilson 2017, this book), phytolith/pollen analysis, microarchaeology, and spatial analysis of artefact distribution. Taking into account the complexity of dark earth, its study requires a systematic analytical approach. Beginning with appropriate research questions, it

encompasses quality sampling, knowledge of natural processes acting in these specific contexts, and the application of solid interpretive models drawn from archaeological excavations.

On the whole, the application of the analytical methods of earth sciences to European dark earths contributed to shed light on deposits interpreted as the result of generic 'abandonment' of cities, or that were interpreted as gardens, backfill units, or even as alluvium (see Yule 1990; Macphail et al. 2003; Brogiolo 2011). Thirty years of such analyses allowed us to understand that in many cases, dark earths are rather the outcome of a continuity of use of the urban space. This continuity is marked by markedly different, more distinctly 'rural' conditions, with respect to the previous times.

continuity of use in postclassical urban or proto-urban centres across Europe.

Micromorphology and the other analytical tools of earth sciences clarified also the role of natural sedimentation in the accretion of urban stratigraphy and in the formation of dark earth. This is of particular significance for cities located in alluvial environments (see Heimdahl 2005; Cremaschi & Nicosia 2010; Nicosia et al. 2012), and suggests the need for a broader, regional or supraregional perspective when approaching dark earths. Combining different diagnostic features with different analytical techniques, and at different scales (i.e. from regional to microscopic) can also help overcome the issue of the equifinality of many micromorphological features. Equifinality hampers robust interpretation, as it implies that the same feature can arise as a result of quite different processes and activities.

# 33.1 Introduction

Amazonian dark earths (ADEs) are expanses of pre-Columbian anthropic soils mostly reported at, or close to, the land surface of Tertiary Age, nonflooding terrain of eastern and southern Amazonia (Smith 1980; WinklerPrins & Aldrich 2010; Arroyo-Kalin 2014a). They were first recorded by nineteenth-century scientific explorers and naturalists, who noted the dark colour of their topsoil and the presence of abundant archaeological pottery shards on their surface (Myers et al. 2003). Amazonian dark earth expanses, which occur in regions with potential or actual vegetation ranging from woody savannah to dense aseasonal rainforest, range from  $< 1$  to  $80\mathrm{ha}$  in surface area and are today frequently used for crop cultivation (Glaser et al. 2001). They form on different soil types and, in general, show higher retention of organic matter, higher black carbon contents, more neutral pH and a higher nutrient status compared to the soil mantles on which they have formed (Lehmann et al. 2003; Glaser & Woods 2004; Woods et al. 2009; Glaser & Birk 2011). Similar anthropic soils have been reported in neighbouring regions beyond the Amazon basin, such as the Orinoco basin and the Guyanas (Vacher et al. 1998; Versteeg 2003; Ochoa 2010; Brancier et al. 2014).

Amazonian dark earths are best understood as the outcome of pedogenetic processes conditioned by land surfaces that have been enriched and transformed by past inhabitation practices (Arroyo-Kalin 2014a). This is borne out by archaeological research, which shows that most ADE expanses are large, open-air archaeological sites marking the location of large pre-Columbian settlements (Nimuendajú 1949; Hilbert 1968; Eden et al. 1984; Heckenberger et al. 1999; Kern et al. 2004; Arroyo-Kalin 2010a; Neves 2013; Schmidt et al. 2014). Recent discussion has emphasized the importance of the broad distribution of ADEs as a proxy for significant pre-Columbian

environmental impact on the Amazon basin (Denevan 2001; WinklerPrins & Aldrich 2010; Arroyo-Kalin 2012; Schmidt et al. 2014; McMichael et al. 2014). In these assessments, as well as other studies emphasizing their fertility for crop cultivation (e.g. Glaser et al. 2001; Steiner et al. 2007), the rubric ADE generally refers to terras pretas de indio ('[Amer]indian dark earths'). The latter are the paradigmatic dark, thick, fertile anthropic soil expanses with abundant embedded pottery fragments mentioned in the opening paragraph (Figures 33.1, 33.2 and 33.3). However, under the rubric of Amazonian dark earths we may also include other anthropic soils reported within Amazonia and in neighbouring lowland regions, for instance artefact-rich anthropic brown earths lacking the distinctively dark colour of terras pretas (e.g. Andrade 1986; Mora et al. 1990; Myers 2004; Schaan et al. 2009; Walker 2011; Brancier et al. 2014; Arroyo-Kalin 2014b) and thick anthropic brown soils that lack archaeological remains yet show physicochemical parameters intermediate between nearby terras pretas and local soils. The latter are also known as terras mulatas (Sombroek 1966; Woods 2002; Arroyo-Kalin 2010a). Systematic taxonomic proposals to classify ADEs have been advanced by soil scientists (Kampf et al. 2003, 2009). Other students argue different types of ADE constitute a broad continuum (Fraser et al. 2011).

A number of models have been advanced to explain the formation of ADEs. The most widely cited is the kitchen midden model (Sombroek et al. 2002), which argues that terra preta soils – that is, dark earths associated with abundant settlement remains – are the result of the decomposition of food remains, human excrements, household rubbish and combustion residues accumulated in pre-Columbian refuse dumps. A second model is known as the house garden model. It suggests that some of the same inputs would have accumulated in middens (where, in some cases, they would have been

Figure 33.1 An ADE profile exposed by archaeological excavations at the Hatahara site by the Central Amazon Project in the Brazilian state of Amazonas (see Neves 2013). Below roots immediately under the exposed surface, ADE deposits show highly fragmented pottery and rubified clay fragments. They overlie a thick, partly melanized, buried A horizon with large bedded fragments of pottery (middle left of section) that suggest a pit. Stratigraphic distinctions are rendered invisible by strong melanization. Krotovina-like faunal burrows and root canals in the B horizon are infilled with sediments that originate higher in the profile. Ranging rod is  $1\mathrm{m}$  wide.

burnt) before being used as amendments for different types of gardens and orchards (WinklerPrins 2002; Hecht 2003; Myers 2004; Schmidt et al. 2014). A third hypothesis is the house model, which suggests that large and long-lived longhouses would have acted as efficient sediment traps to concentrate ash, small-sized charcoal, small-sized food waste, organic matter and soot accumulated on the underside of organic roof thatch. In this scenario human trampling would have helped to embed inclusions into stable dry surfaces prior to their reworking by soil fauna after human abandonment (Arroyo-Kalin 2008). A final model – the outfields or intensive cultivation model – is specific to terras mulatas. It suggests that expanses of ADEs located around and away

from pre-Columbian settlements would have resulted from clearance and cultivation practices variously based on the intensive use of fire and and/or additions of organic amendments (Sombroek 1966; Denevan 2004; Arroyo-Kalin 2010a).

Detailed archaeological studies emphasize that individual ADE expanses display significant horizontal and vertical variability (Costa & Kern 1999; Rebellato et al. 2009; Arroyo-Kalin et al. 2009; Costa et al. 2013; Soderström et al. 2013), often reflecting sequential occupations by different groups of people in pre-Columbian times (Arroyo-Kalin 2010a). Hence geoarchaeological and, specifically, soil micromorphological studies of ADEs, need to take into consideration a variety of processes taking place between past human practices and the formation of these resiliently enriched soil expanses (Woods 1995; Vacher et al. 1998; Kern et al. 2004; Erickson 2003; Arroyo-Kalin 2014a). Included here is the fact that past peoples prepared places through clearance of vegetation and topsoil exposure; that they conducted spatially patterned practices that led to the deposition

Figure 33.3 An ADE profile exposed by excavations through a mound at the Hatahara site (depth  $230\mathrm{cm}$ , width  $100\mathrm{cm}$ ). The position of undisturbed blocks highlights the rationale employed in the sampling for micromorphological study. A subangular blocky structure has developed on the artefact-rich, strongly melanized A horizon, which overlies a well-stratified archaeological deposit showing bedded fragments of pottery. A large archaeological pit feature (marked with dashed lines) with abundant fragments of pottery cannot be distinguished from sediments at the same depth using sediment characteristics. However, microscopic charcoal from the feature dates to the third and fourth centuries BC whilst charcoal from underlying buried A and AB horizons (Ab, ABb) dates from the eighth and tenth centuries AD (see Arroyo-Kalin 2012).

and / or in situ alteration of debris and waste (as suggested by the four models previously described) and that they removed and relocated sediments for different purposes (e.g. post holes, rubbish pits, garden composts, platform building, planting and others) and, in some cases, affected sediments enriched by previous occupations. The broad outcome of this earth altering dynamic needs to be considered in the context of soil forming and sedimentary processes, including the role of soil fauna (burying past occupation surfaces, reworking originally stratified deposits and helping to comminate and degrade debris and waste), phyto-stabilization afforded by vegetation regrowth following site abandonment (which affected the great majority of ADE sites), changes to soil chemistry that would enhance or reduce the archaeological preservation potential of different areas within a given anthropic

soil expanse (Kern et al. 2004) and the effects of surface runoff and tree uprooting, especially in reshaping land surfaces with originally higher anthropogenic relief into horizontally more spread out mantles of enriched sediments. Hence, geoarchaeological approaches employing micromorphological observations to interrogate the properties of specific ADE expanses need to keep in mind that these soils are an outcome of soil formation on palimpsests of past human occupations.

# 33.2 Sampling Considerations

In the field, the first salient characteristic of Amazonian dark earths is strong melanization of the topsoil (Figures 33.1, 33.2 and 33.3). For instance, vertical exposures show that artefact-rich terra preta soils found in the vicinity of Manaus, Brazil, are often expressed as a dark-coloured, organic-rich, surface mantle that is tens of centimetres thick. Usually the latter will grade diffusely, through a transitional horizon, to underlying lighter coloured, organic-poor sediments that may show faunal burrows and root canals infilled with strongly melanized sediments. This description holds irrespective of whether the prevailing soil mantle is sandy or clayey textured, which, however, will determine a soil structure ranging from massive to weakly subangular blocky (Arroyo-Kalin et al. 2009). When not buried by additional sedimentation (thus becoming a buried horizon), this alternation of distinct layers (used here in the sense of Phillips & Lorz 2008) maps onto an A-AB-B horizon sequence as described by soil scientists. However, despite being obscured by characteristic strong melanization, the 'A horizon' can show indications of bedding that include changes in compaction, the presence of archaeological features, archaeological artefacts marking former surfaces and - in floodplain contexts - alluvial sedimentary inputs (see also Nicosia et al. 2017, this book). The 'A horizon' moreover tends to thin out at the scale of  $10 - 100\mathrm{s}$  of metres. Differences in horizons and subhorizons recorded by soil scientists (Lima et al. 2002; Kampf et al. 2009; Souza 2011; Macedo et al. 2013), therefore, are sometimes differences in archaeological stratigraphy that can be ascertained through a combination of geoarchaeological observations and supplementary archaeological evidence (Arroyo-Kalin 2009, 2014b). This strongly encourages a 'systematic' (continuous) rather than a 'selective' sampling strategy (in the sense of Courty et al. 1989) for soil micromorphological research, with supplementary blocks potentially used to sample sharp boundaries between layers, pit fills and any suspect evidence of relict stratification (Figure 33.3).

# 33.3 Soil Micromorphology of ADEs

A small number of soil micromorphological studies have been conducted on pre-Columbian anthropic soil expanses from the Brazilian Amazon (Creutzberg 2002; Lima et al. 2002; Schaefer et al. 2004; Arroyo-Kalin 2009; Arroyo-Kalin et al. 2009; Souza 2011; Macedo et al. 2013), French Guiana (Brancier et al. 2014), the Ecuadorian Amazon and the lower Orinoco region (Arroyo-Kalin 2014b). Aside from one micromorphological study of terras mulatas (Arroyo-Kalin 2009, 2010a, 2012), the majority of these studies focus on dark, artefact-rich terras pretas. Most of these studies have also carried out physical and chemical analyses on bulk samples and/or relied on elemental maps of thin sections produced through electron microprobe and SEM/EDS (Lima 2001; Schaefer et al. 2004; Arroyo-Kalin et al. 2009; Schaan et al. 2009; Souza 2011).

Except where inputs of alluvial sediments directly affect the locale where an ADE expanse has formed (see below), soil micromorphological studies suggest that thick melanized ADE layers are not the result of additions of mineral sediments of a different geological origin. Microscopic observations using different light sources instead suggest that most ADE expanses mimic quite closely the texture, c/f related distribution and porosity patterns of their respective background soils, which – as noted previously – are diverse (Lima et al. 2002; Arroyo-Kalin et al. 2009; Souza 2011; Macedo et al. 2013). As regards texture, thin sections of 'background' Oxisols highlight a bimodal particle size distribution whilst anthropic soils formed on these substrates show abundant particulate inclusions of anthropic origin (discussed below) that bulk up the silt and sand-sized fractions (Arroyo-Kalin et al. 2009). Studies report c/f-related distribution patterns varying from a grain-supported or enaulic microstructure in coarse-textured soils to a matrix-supported or porphyric c/f-related distribution pattern in finer textured soils. Along this continuum (from sandy to clayey), the microscopic organization of sediments range from a single-grain microstructure with irregularly shaped intergrain clayey peds, to a complex arrangement of subangular blocky to irregularly shaped clayey peds with scarce quartz sand. In the latter case many aggregates appear to be coalescent excrements of enchymraeids, earthworms, ants and termites. Porosity generally ranges from packing voids between quartz grains to the characteristic voids resulting from faunal turbation (Kooistra & Pulleman 2010). At this scale, in short, the overall impression gained from micromorphological observation is that ADEs are subject to intense faunal reworking. At the mesoscale of a

magnified thin section view, the organization of constituents of some ADE deposits greatly resembles European dark earth deposits that are similarly textured (Cammas 2004; Arroyo-Kalin et al. 2010; Nicosia et al. 2017, this book), with coarse sand-sized or larger debris randomly distributed between clay peds that, in turn, embed fine-sized particulate material of anthropic origin (Figure 33.4). In some cases (Tertiary substrates), inherited quartz grains show runiquartz characteristics (Eswaran et al. 1975; Schnutgen & Spath 1983) and are essentially analogous to those observed in the A horizon of background soils (Arroyo-Kalin et al. 2009). In other cases (Quaternary alluvial settings) profiles record the rhythmic deposition of waterborne sediments (Souza 2011; Brancier et al. 2014).

Amazonian dark earths and background soils show significant differences, reflecting disparities in terms of anthropic inputs, degrees of bioturbation and preservation. All studies coincide that melanization is a result of the combined effect of intense staining with organic matter of the fine mineral fraction, coupled with the ubiquitous presence of microscopic charcoal fragments. Colours of the fine mineral fraction generally range from dark brown to greyish dark brown (PPL/OIL), with an undifferentiated to very weakly speckled b-fabric (XPL). As regards microscopic charcoal, reported densities vary greatly: some studies show that the latter is preferentially present as finely comminuted, fine sand-sized to silts-sized fragments that are densely embedded in peds of both sandy and clayey ADEs (Figure 33.5). Against this abundance, organs, tissues and/or cell fragments are rare, underscoring the very efficient comminution activity of soil fauna (Topoliantz & Ponge 2005) and the possible deposition of soot-like (Masiello 2004) fine-textured black carbon. Microscopic charcoal is rarer in an anthropic brown earth from the lower Orinoco (Arroyo-Kalin 2014b) and, consequently, does not appear to influence overall melanization directly. Similar contrasts have also been observed within anthropic brown earths of French Guiana (Brancier et al. 2014).

A characteristic aspect of most ADEs studied using soil micromorphology is the presence of small fragments of pottery and rubified clay aggregates, aquatic sponge spicules and opal phytoliths (Figure 33.6). Pottery fragments and clayey aggregates evidence comminution of debris produced and discarded in occupied settlements (microscopic fragments of heat-treated clay are lacking in reported terra mulata samples). Pottery fragments comminate down to sand size and are subangular to rounded inclusions primarily tempered with aquatic sponge spicules and, less frequently, with charcoal fragments, grog and silt- to fine sand-sized quartz grains. Of the pottery tempering agents, the well-reported use of

silica sponge spicules (Linne 1957) is confirmed by their occasional scattered presence in the groundmass, pointing to the availability of raw materials for manufacture and, potentially, the decomposition of pottery fragments. Amazonian sponges are mostly documented from flooded marshlands and river banks (Barros et al. 2013), so only in ADE sites located at these settings and on floodplains (as opposed to nonflooding uplands, where the majority of ADEs are reported) can sponge spicules be argued to be inherited from the parent material. Rubified clay aggregates likewise comminate to sand sized, subrounded bright orange clay aggregates, their most likely origins being the decay of different types of cooking facilities, including ovens (Arroyo-Kalin 2010b) and fire rests (Ribeiro 2014). Overall, heat-treated clay microartefacts, including their tempering agents, appear to be quite resistant to degradation and, consequently, they affect measurable properties of bulk samples (Costa et al. 2004a, 2004b; Arroyo-Kalin 2008). Phytoliths have been reported in studies of ADEs and can sometimes be seen in thin section. Of considerable interest to soil micromorphologists are inferences that can be drawn from the compared study of the magnetic susceptibility of background soils, terras mulatas and terras pretas (Arroyo-Kalin 2010a). The latter suggest that high magnetic susceptibility measurements in ADEs reflect the combined effects of inclusions of heat-treated clay and

pre-Columbian surface burning acting on Fe-rich sediments (see Allen & Macphail 1987).

Microscopic fragments of bone are reported in some but not other studies of ADEs. Bone fragments generally comminate to fine sand-sized fragments (Figure 33.7) and are very common in thin sections from clayey terras pretas forming on Tertiary-Age land surfaces (Arroyo-Kalin et al. 2009; Macedo et al. 2013) as well as in anthropic dark earths formed on Quaternary-Age substrates along the Solimões-Amazon river (Souza 2011). Microscopic fish bone is also common in charcoal-poor, dark brown, sandy-textured anthropic soils forming on Quaternary sediments of the lower Orinoco region (Arroyo-Kalin 2014b). Bone is nearly entirely lacking in studied samples from sandy terras pretas formed on Tertiary-Age substrates along the Negro river, near Manaus (Arroyo-Kalin et al. 2009). Bones are completely absent from studied samples of dark occupation deposits associated with Tertiary- and Quaternary-Age substrates in French Guiana (Brancier et al. 2014), as well as from strongly melanized, clayey-textured, charcoal-rich Quaternary Age deposits from the Ecuadorian Amazon (Arroyo-Kalin 2014b). The varying proportion of bone fragments in different contexts, therefore, must partly reflect regional availability and intrasettlement variation in the intensity of pre-Columbian discard, as well as preservation factors that include soil texture, porosity

and pH. In thin section, bone can be characterized by very low order interference colours under XPL, pointing to overall loss of collagen (Jans 2005; see also Villagran et al. 2017, this book). However, it is generally extremely well preserved, in some case showing strong autofluorescence under UVL, which suggests high retention of phosphorus in bone apatite (Arroyo-Kalin et al. 2009). Elemental maps based on SEM of thin sections with bone fragments in terra preta samples collected near Manaus highlight that the latter are rich in Ca and P and reveal that little leaching and diffusion of these elements towards the clayey fraction of the soil appears to have taken place (Schaefer et al. 2004; Souza 2011).

A common observation of different micromorphological studies is that ADEs show a very high frequency and chaotic disposition of gravel- to fine-sand sized rounded to subangular aggregates with fabric characteristics that

point to an origin higher or lower in the profile (Figure 33.8). Similarly, other horizons show frequent aggregates with dissimilar fabric characteristics and embedded microscopic charcoal typical of ADEs. In some instances, gravel-sized aggregates can be interpreted as evidence of soil modification by past pre-Columbian peoples (Figure 33.8a and b). In such cases, consideration of other contextual evidence can assist inferences about past digging and/or cultivation practices. However, in the smaller size classes, most aggregates can be associated with the activity of soil fauna and thus linked to their role in the burial and preservation of soil layers (Johnson 1985; Vacher et al. 1998; Phillips & Lorz 2008) and to reworking of specific deposits immediately after deposition. This underscores that traces of stratification indicating past occupation surfaces – in some cases perhaps similar to the stratified dark-coloured sediments observed

in human-made mounds in Amazonian flooding landscapes (Versteeg 1985; Schaan et al. 2009; Jaimes 2012) - are unlikely to be regularly found in ADEs (Arroyo-Kalin et al. 2010). However, it is the exception that proves the rule: a zone with contrasting fabrics within a buried A horizon under a clayey ADE deposit, stratified lenses in the fill of storage pits and very rare matrix-supported clayey peds in sandy ADEs can be observed in terra pretas formed on Tertiary-Age substrates; also illuvial clays appear to be truncated at the contact between a buried terra mulata A horizon (2Ab) and the Bt horizon (see Arroyo-Kalin 2009, 2010a; Arroyo-Kalin et al. 2009). These contrasting fabrics evidence faint but persistent microstratigraphic evidence. Along similar lines, studies in French Guiana have successfully quantified changes in charcoal density along a profile to distinguish different microfacies (Brancier et al. 2014). Studies along the floodplain of the Amazon river and in French Guiana have also documented rhythmic alluvial sediment inputs (Souza 2011; Brancier et al. 2014). Thus, it is accurate to state that soil micromorphological analysis is a powerful tool to detect relict stratigraphic information in ADEs.

Some pedofeatures observed in terras pretas are worthy of specific attention. Despite very intense levels of faunal reworking, well-developed dusty clay coatings are reported by different studies, especially along channels, planar voids and vughs of artefact-rich ADEs (Figure 33.8c, d). These pedofeatures contrast sharply with limpid illuvial clay coatings, which are typical of oxic horizons (Arroyo-Kalin 2008; Marcelino et al. 2010). Their 'high position' in the profile, above the B horizon, is likely related to low microporosity within a thick ADE deposit (after Kuhn et al. 2010, see also Teixeira et al. 2009). Dusty clay coatings may record the dispersal of organic-rich clay induced by the

release of potassium from ash (Arroyo-Kalin et al. 2009, after Slager & van der Wetering 1977), the destabilizing effects of bioturbation and alternating cycles of wetting and drying on faunally produced aggregates (Macedo et al. 2013) and past clearance and tillage (Brancier et al. 2014; see also Deak et al. 2017, this book). Similar coatings are found in the lower part of the A horizon of terras mulatas (Arroyo-Kalin 2008), which supports scenarios involving clearance and ash deposition. However, ash-diagnostic calcium oxalate plant cell pseudomorphs are not apparent in ADEs (nor reported in other Amazonian anthropic soils and archaeosediments). Whilst some of the dusty clay coatings may overlap features observed in agricultural and flooded soils (i.e. the 'agricutans' of Brewer and the flooding coatings of Brammer, see Kuhn et al. 2010), much work remains to be done in order to isolate robust micromorphological indicators of these types of practices, as well as of other inputs and processes.

# 34.4 Conclusions

Amazonian dark earths are best understood as the outcome of pedogenetic processes conditioned by land surfaces that have been enriched and transformed by pre-Columbian settlement and/or cultivation practices. They include terras pretas, terras mulatas and other dark-coloured anthropic soils associated with archaeological remains (Arroyo-Kalin 2014a). ADEs form from a palimpsest of pre-Columbian activities. As a category, ADEs is fuzzy in the sense that it can readily include other types of anthropic soils and archaeosediments from the Neotropical humid lowlands. Included here are a wide array of cases, ranging from dark anthropically enriched sediments associated with early archaeological sites both within and beyond the immediate region (Oyuela-Caycedo & Bonzani 2005; Castillo & Aceituno 2006; Arroyo-Kalin 2010a) to thin, charcoal-rich

sediment deposits forming on human-made mounds in lowland flooding landscapes (Versteeg 1985; Schaan et al. 2009; Jaimez 2012). The study of these and other stratified occupation deposits is important because some most likely bear a genetic relationship to ADEs as primary substrates.

Amazonian dark earths are remarkably fertile compared to the surrounding soil mantle upon which they have developed. Properties that underpin this fertility can be partially studied with the help of soil micromorphological analysis. The latter shows that microscopic charcoal fragments, bone and/or heat-treated clay fragments (including pottery and its constituents) are variously preserved within strongly melanized anthropic dark earths and sediments. These microscopic inclusions can be partially related to high organic matter and black carbon contents, high P and Ca and significant enhancement of magnetic susceptibility in both dark anthropic soils and archaeosediments (Lima et al. 2002; Schaefer et al. 2004; Arroyo-Kalin et al. 2009; Souza 2011; see also Glaser & Birk 2011). However, fossil traces of other likely inputs such as shell (Kern et al. 2004), ash (Arroyo-Kalin et al. 2009) and human bodily waste (Birk et al. 2011) have so far not been observed in thin section, most likely due to diagenesis. This underscores that much work remains to be conducted in order to explain the higher pH observed in most ADE expanses, as well as to pinpoint specific contributors to high Mn, Ba, Cu, K, Mg, Na, Sr and Zn (Woods 2003).

Melanization of dark pre-Columbian anthropic soils and other archaeosediments can be linked directly to the ubiquitous presence of silt-size or larger microscopic charcoal as well as strong organic matter retention. In this connection, comparative microscopic observations show that a hallmark feature of sediments recognized as terras pretas is high density of very fine sand- to silt-sized charcoal within the matrix (Arroyo-Kalin 2014b). This not only implies that the confident identification of highly comminuted charcoal (using OIL) is useful to distinguish between terras pretas and other strongly melanized sediments, but also helps to fine-tune existing assessments about the variability of ADEs. At the spatial scale of the soil expanse, charcoal will have been deposited where it was more abundantly produced in the past, where it was discarded and/or where charred material accumulated (domestic fires, pottery making facilities, middens, interior of houses, smouldering 'cool' fires, etc.). It is these charcoal-rich areas within a locale that will have been reworked by postdepositionalprocesses-verticallyandhorizontally-- into charcoal-rich sediments. At the scale of a given Amazonian dark earth expanse, therefore, it is fore

seeable that intervening areas will show less melanized sediments with lower charcoal density, leading to less strongly melanized sediments that embed variable quantities of artefacts. Similar, if not necessarily spatially overlapping scenarios can be envisioned regarding the overall abundance and ubiquity of microscopic heat-treated clay artefacts (pottery, rubified clay) and microscopic bone fragments, the latter being preferentially found in middens. At the same time, some of these will be more readily subject to degradation under low pH or within coarse textured ADEs.

Soil micromorphology helps to assess some of the ethnographically-based hypotheses that have been advanced to explain the formation of ADEs. It also demonstrates that terras pretas signal 'intensity' of very specific practices in the past (Arroyo-Kalin 2010a, 2012). Significant challenges lie ahead. First, a better balance needs to be achieved between establishing and measuring variability at the scale of the soil expanse vis-à-vis the very spatially restricted observations afforded by microscopic analysis. Second, fundamental questions about the sources and transportation of sediments within ADEs remain, including ascertaining the extent to which soil fauna conveyor activity contributes to burial and preservation of these deposits. Third, recording material signatures of behaviour correlates derived from experimental and ethnoarchaeological situations is especially important to test whether some types of ADEs were used for cultivation in pre-Columbian times. The importance of this challenge cannot be overemphasized: the ethnographic evidence for cultivation-oriented soil management is strong (e.g., Hecht 2003; Schmidt et al. 2014) and arguments linking cultivation to terras mulatas have been advanced (Sombroek 1966; Woods 2002; Denevan 2004; Arroyo-Kalin 2010a). When it comes to reworked occupation deposits, however, much tighter links need to be established between cause and effect before dusty clay coatings (Brancier et al. 2014), fragmentation of surface pottery (Schmidt et al. 2014), soil fertility (Lehmann et al. 2004; Glaser & Birk 2011) and/or the presence of plant macro and microfossil (Herrera et al. 1992; Bozarth et al. 2009) can be marshalled as strong evidence for cultivation in pre-Columbian times. This is because settlement activities unrelated to cultivation may readily result in micromorphological signatures and microscopic fossils that are analogous to those employed to infer clearance, uprooting and cultivation (e.g. Macphail et al. 1990; Holliday 2004; Deak et al. 2017, this book). To judge by the similarities and contrasts recorded by the few micromorphological studies of ADEs so far undertaken, however, the overall outlook is promising, especially if comparable techniques and similar reporting standards are adopted by future students.

# 34.1 Introduction

Humans have inhabited caves and rock shelters since the Palaeolithic for more than 2 million years. Remains from their repeated occupations result in stratified geological and archaeological deposits. These sediments furnish a wealth of information about environmental changes, site formation processes, and inroads to understanding past activities and behaviour. Although rock shelters can form in a number of ways (Mentzer, 2017), they are cavities that tend to be wider than deep and can be found along cliff walls as an overhang. They thus provide protection from wind and rain, while remaining open to the outside, where there is natural light, vegetation and a good view of the landscape. Caves are more enclosed, and can penetrate tens to hundreds of meters into the bedrock, which is often limestone. Although cave entrances are more prominent in the archaeological record, use of deep galleries for domestic and ritual activities has also been documented in sites from different chronologies. Interestingly, geoarchaeological investigations of cave deposits have not only provided archaeologists important information about site formation and human activities, but they have supplied invaluable palaeoenvironmental, chronological, and geomorphological data to the geoscience community, who rarely study such contexts.

Both caves and rock shelters can be distinguished from open-air sites in being laterally constrained by walls. This has repercussions regarding depositional and postdepositional processes (Goldberg & Mandel 2008). Deep caves are restricted in their sources of sedimentation, which mainly comprise clay derived from solution weathering, authigenic minerals, and detrital mineralogenic silt and sand infiltrated through joints and conduits (Ford & Williams 1989). Occasionally, animals and humans

contribute faecal and bone remains. Humans might also introduce stone tools, pottery, or other artefacts. In contrast, rock shelter and cave mouth sedimentary deposits receive a relatively higher proportion of inputs from plants and animals (including humans), as well as from a wide variety of geogenic sources including bedrock, slopes, beaches, dunes, floodplains, or whatever sedimentary source occurs nearby.

The earliest sedimentological studies can be traced back to classic Palaeolithic sites of Southwest and Southeast France, and Central Europe, with the works of several Quaternary geoscientists (Bonifay 1956; Schmid 1958; Bordes 1972; Laville 1964; Farrand 1975; Laville 1976; Laville et al. 1980; Butzer 1981). At that time, field geomorphology and bulk sedimentological analyses provided general information about geogenic depositional processes and by inference, paleoclimates and climatochronological sequences (Laville et al. 1980). Such methods were standard practice in Old World geoarchaeology until the 1980s when researchers began to realize the extent of human inputs in many cave deposits (Goldberg 1979, 1980). Since then, cave and rock shelter archaeological deposits have been commonly studied at a microstratigraphic scale using multidisciplinary approaches, among which soil micromorphology has played a key role (Karkanas & Goldberg 2013).

Micromorphological investigations of prehistoric caves and rock shelter deposits have been carried out in different regions of the world (Goldberg 1979; Cremaschi 1990; Goldberg & Sherwood 1994; Macphail et al. 1994; Boschian 1997; Goldberg & Bar-Yosef 1998; Goldberg & Arpin 1999; Vallverdu 1999, 2001; Braillard 2000; Goldberg 2000; Goldberg & Macphail 2000; Macphail & Goldberg 2000; Goldberg 2001; Sherwood 2001; Karkanas 2002; Angelucci 2003; Mallol & Carbonell

2008; Angelucci & Zilhao 2009; Karkanas & Goldberg 2010a; Mentzer & Quade 2012; Miller et al. 2013). These, among other similar studies have provided a corpus of information and data on the most common basic microscopic components, textures and fabrics in such sedimentary deposits and furnished hypotheses about the different kinds of geogenic and biogenic (including anthropogenic) processes they represent. As such, these works have equipped us with comparative material to approach site formation processes in archaeological caves and rock shelters. In this entry, we illustrate with examples of our own work, examples of the main depositional and postdepositional processes occurring in cave and rock shelter contexts and some of their representative micromorphological features.

# 34.2 Common Microfabrics from Rock Shelter and Cave Sites

Although caves and rock shelter deposits are complex – being an intimate mixture of geogenic and anthropogenic components – individual microfabrics are visible and decipherable under the microscope, and hence can be used to infer geological and human agents, as well as syn- and postdepositional modifications.

We present depositional and physical syndepositional processes together because the main agents of cave sedimentation (wind, water and animals, including humans) can also strongly modify existing deposits penecontemporaneously; thus the micromorphological features resulting from both primary deposition and reworking are intricately related. For instance, at the entrance runoff may rework aeolian silt and sand resulting in finely laminated sand, silt and sandy clay, which are virtually 'instantaneous' from the geoarchaeological point of view.

# 34.2.1 Geogenic Deposition and Syndepositional Physical Reworking

The variety of natural depositional environments and processes near cave entrances and rock shelters is rather limited. Certain kinds of deposits, such as sandy and silty ones derived from aeolian sedimentation or silty clayey deposits from low energy runoff or sheet wash are common in cave mouths and rock shelters and resemble those from the open air.

# 34.2.1.1 Aeolian Sedimentation

Aeolian deposits vary in their lithology and grain size depending on their source, but in general, they are characterized by predominantly well-sorted sand or silt in a matrix that can vary from loose to compact depending on the particular postdepositional processes affecting it;

depending on the archaeological context, sandy deposits can also be mixed with bone, stone, charcoal, shell, and pottery. With the exception of in situ sand accumulations of dunes (generally rare, although see for example some South African coastal caves: Mossel Bay – Karkanas & Goldberg 2010a), windblown sediment is syndepositionally reworked (e.g., runoff, bioturbation, or trampling) and mixed with other sedimentary components before burial.

Aeolian quartz silt is also a component in caves but rarely as a distinct layer of loess. Rather, it arrives incorporated with other, nonaeolian sediments, as in the case of silt being first embedded into surface soils, which were then washed into the cavity (e.g., Kebara, Dust Cave; Sherwood 2001; Goldberg et al. 2007).

Different microfabrics comprised of sand and silt have been documented in several sites. At Die Kelders Cave, S. Africa, aeolian sand decalcified in place is overlain by brown silty clay that partially has percolated into it; both are overlain by aeolian sand composed of quartz and shell, which was the precursor to the bottommost sand before it was decalcified (Goldberg 2000; Figure 34.1).

The site of Mandrin, in southeastern France (Slimak 2008), is a shallow cave facing the Rhone Valley and exposed to the Mistral seasonal winds. Here, the main component of the Pleistocene deposit is windblown quartz sand derived from alluvium with minor proportions of glauconite sand; there is very little micromass either coating or bridging the sand grains. This loose sandy deposit contains common, moderately well sorted sand-sized flint, rounded bone, char and charcoal fragments derived from Palaeolithic human occupations (Figure 34.2). This case of embedding is the result of trampling of anthropogenic debris on a loose, sandy substrate.

# 34.2.1.2 Runoff and Sheet Wash

Low energy transport of silty clayey sediment is a common process in caves and rock shelters and has been widely documented in a number of prehistoric caves where sediments are derived from an overlying plateau (e.g., Dust Cave, Alabama or Kebara and Hayonim, Israel, Goldberg & Sherwood 1994; Goldberg & Bar-Yosef 1998; Sherwood et al. 2004). Some of the characteristic microfabrics consist of a clayey micromass with variable amounts of silt and or sand derived from nearby soils or bedrock (Figure 34.3). Depending on the energy of deposition, the thickness of a single runoff lamina can range from one to several cm, or even more in massive flood events. Under the microscope, these may exhibit horizontal bedding or diffuse bedding, and sometimes localized silt or sand 'stringers' or laminae interbedded within clayey sediment (Figure 34.3). However, such fine bedding can be easily obliterated by postdepositional

processes and result in a massive or crumbly silty / sandy clayey microfabric. Strong rainfall bringing a large quantity of water into the cave may also result in vertical translocation of particles by percolating water, such as reported at Die Kelders (Goldberg 2000).

# 34.2.1.3 Dripping and Groundwater

Dripping water is a common phenomenon beneath rock shelter or cave entrance overhangs and in humid cave interiors and its identification in an archaeological context can provide important clues to locate former driplines or delimit very humid areas, as in the case of Pech de l'Aze IV where calcitic hypocoatings formed beneath the former cave roof (Dibble et al. 2009; Figure 34.4).

Due to the localized nature of dripping water, secondarily derived calcite is commonly found in isolated samples, not continuously across space. This is an important condition to take into consideration because secondary calcium carbonate precipitation is a common postdepositional phenomenon and its occurrence can be linked to many different processes. In contrast, groundwater, which has a similar micromorphological expression, can be found laterally spread and cementing greater portions of a deposit, typically with sparite. The presence of interstitial sparite is representative of phreatic conditions (Figure 34.5a and b) whereas micrite or microsparite may indicate vadose conditions (Figure 34.5c and d) (Durand et al. 2010). An example of the latter is the typical 'breccia' reported in numerous archaeological cave contexts (Figure 34.6). This type of sediment usually comprises clasts of archaeological and natural material cemented by secondary calcium carbonate of variable crystal size (Figure 34.7).

# 34.2.1.4 Roofspall

Bedrock debris from the walls and ceilings of caves and rock shelters, often known as 'roofspall', is a common element in most archaeological deposits of this kind. Overall, it is characterized by clasts matching the lithology of the bedrock, but clast shape and degree of sorting may vary. The presence of angular to subrounded, poorly sorted clastic accumulations point to the vicinity of a source of roofspall, while rounded, better sorted accumulations may be derived from transported roofspall (Figure 34.8), chemical attack (diagenesis), and more rarely, cryoturbation, which may round roofspall considerably.

In many cases, the bedrock is limestone or dolomite that is susceptible to subaerial weathering and can be affected by seasonal or larger scale climatic shifts in humidity and temperature. Therefore, variations in the proportion of roofspall throughout a stratified sequence can provide clues about environmental changes. However, in many sites (e.g., Kebara and Hayonim, Israel or Roc de Marsal, France) roofspall may be phosphatized or be totally dissolved, so one cannot take clast abundance as an absolute indicator of climatic change. In many caves in South Africa, quartzite bedrock is fractured and easily spalled, producing tabular, angular pieces (Karkanas & Goldberg 2010a).

Whilst still in place, overhangs, walls and ceilings of caves and rock shelters are also exposed to biogenic agents (plant, animal and microbial activity), which may leave a micromorphological signature as weathering rinds or laminations on the surface of clasts (Campy 1989; Braillard 2000; Marks et al. 2002; Braillard et al. 2004) often a product of bat/bird guano diagenesis (see Figure 34.8d and e). In these cases, the rinds are yellow in PPL, isotropic in XPL, and carefully conform to the outer

surface of the clast; the colour and isotropy are indicative of a phosphatic composition, likely dahlite (Weiner et al. 2007 - see Figure 34.9a). In other cases, they are dark brown or black in PPL (Figure 34.9b, c and d), suggesting an organic composition that may originate from biogenic or pedogenic substances, or even from anthropogenic soot. In these cases, it is not possible to determine the source using micromorphology.

Nevertheless, rinds on clasts may also form diagenetically, while on the surface or buried beneath it. Postdepositionally, clasts of limestone roof spall are susceptible to diagenetic transformations (e.g., dissolution - Figure 34.10), and just as for bone, their degree of alteration is a measure of the intensity and extension of diagenetic processes, which can be useful to assess the integrity of the associated archaeological record. Factors influencing the degree of diagenesis include for example, biological activity, water content,

and position in the cave. At Kebara and Hayonim Caves, for example, extensive diagenesis was recorded in deposits from the central part of the cave, and not near the walls where the buffering effects of the limestone bedrock were evident.

A different kind of roofspall may occur in cases where the bedrock is composed of loose or friable silty marl or sandy limestone, dolomite, or a substrate liable to disaggregation into sand. In such cases, normal sedimentation consists of a continuous 'rain' of silt or sand, which will be syndepositionally mixed and incorporated into the substrate. Such grains can be identified as roof spall because their shape, size, and inclusions are related to the bedrock lithology (Figure 34.11). Many caves and shelters in the Dordogne, France are characterized by this type of sedimentation, as well as at Meadowcroft Rock shelter, USA (Donahue & Adovasio 1990; Goldberg & Arpin 1999).

# 34.2.1.5 Cold-Climate Features

Humid cave entrances and rock shelters subject to seasonally cold climates undergo cryogenesis. This is a process involving freezing and thawing of water trapped in bedrock cracks and subsurface sediments, generating roof spall (i.e., cryoclasts) and causing microstructural transformation of subsurface sediments, respectively.

Cryoclasts, which are characterized by their angular shapes, are common in Pleistocene archaeological cave deposits and have been traditionally used as markers of cold climates (e.g., Laville et al. 1980), although there proved to be ambiguity in this approach (Texier 2000). Identification of cryoturbation microfabrics, derived from in situ freeze thaw beneath the sedimentary surface,

provides more robust, contextualized evidence of cryogenesis (Van Vliet-Lanoë 1985, 1998, 2005, 2010). These microfabrics may include sand-sized cryoclasts – but with a fine-grained matrix – normally exhibit parallel horizontal fissures and weakly to well-developed lenticular aggregates in what is known as 'frost' or ice lensing. Other characteristic features are silt cappings on clasts (which may be cryoclasts – Figure 34.12) and vesicles from water saturation. Microlaminated calcitic pendentions on clasts have also been documented in arctic open-air contexts (Courty et al. 1994). Recurrent freezing and thawing may lead to stronger cryoturbation in which bedding is obliterated and aggregates become granular due to rotation (Figure 34.12E).

# 34.2.2 Biogenic Depositional Processes

Besides humans, cave and rock shelters are occupied by a variety of animals seeking shelter and warmth. These include hibernating bears, smaller carnivores (e.g., hyenas, fox) that use caves for denning, rodents (including bats) and birds. They not only produce their own waste and deposits (e.g., guano and mud from nest breakdown, respectively), but also physically transform the substrate, as is the case with bears (Stiner et al. 1996). Trampling, rummaging, burrowing, and digging by such animals can obliterate intact combustion structures and human occupation surfaces and strongly disturb the original spatial distribution of archaeological assemblages and their chronology by mixing anthropogenic remains from different time periods. Therefore, identifying the presence of particular animals can be highly informative of the

integrity of the archaeological record. This can be achieved using micromorphology.

# 34.2.2.1 Hyenas and Bears

Archaeological deposits in caves can be heavily disturbed by hibernating or denning animals, as these rework and compress them, as well as litter them with chemically reactive faeces. Identifying the presence of these animals in archaeological context is important because their occurrence indicates an alternation of human and animal occupation and the likelihood that the original makeup and spatial distribution of the context of human activity might not be intact.

Carnivore coprolites – such as those of hyenas – exhibit a massive groundmass with pale grey or yellowish brown hues in PPL, and are bluish grey to isotropic in XPL due to their phosphatic composition (Figure 34.13 – see

Brönniman et al. 2017a, this book). Some specimens might also contain occasional bone splinters. Carnivore coprolite-rich microfacies have been identified at a number of sites (Zhoukoudian - Goldberg et al. 2001; Roc de Marsal - Goldberg et al. 2012; Hohe Fels - Goldberg et al. 2003; Cova del Gegant - Luján & Borras 2011). These commonly exhibit loose, often microaggregate or granular microstructures derived from recurrent surface rummaging and may contain scattered to abundant coprolite fragments (Figure 34.13c).

Bear hibernation has been macroscopically inferred sedimentologically by the reworking of the constituents, as well as the deformed and erosional upper contacts of individual layers. Microscopically, these sediments are strongly phosphatized, with clasts exhibiting weathering rinds. These features have been interpreted as resulting from bear excrements, urine and carcass decomposition (Braillard et al. 2004).

# 34.2.2.2 Bats and Birds

Caves are the natural habitat of bats and because they live in colonies, their droppings accumulate as significant layers of guano (see Karkanas 2017, this book). Identification of such layers in archaeological contexts is important, as they mark periods of human absence in the cave. In prehistoric instances, the guano is typically not preserved, although microfacies rich in chitin remains of insectivorous bat guano including chitin fragments are described in a study of Cendres Cave (Bergadà et al. 2013). However, more commonly, the guano is degraded and leaves behind only proxies, such as phosphatic crusts or nodules representing former surfaces exposed in antiquity (e.g., Mallol et al. 2010). The presence of reactive elements in the chemical composition of guano may also trigger diagenetic changes that affect the preservation of the archaeological record, particularly bone (Karkanas et al. 2000, 2002; Shahack-Gross et al. 2004a; Karkanas & Goldberg 2010b).

Bird guano is a common occurrence in cave entrances and rock shelters near the overhang zone, although in coastal caves, guano can be observed at the rear of the cave (e.g., Cave 13b, S. Africa, Karkanas & Goldberg 2010a). It can be found as sand-sized, massive, nodules reworked into the sediment or amorphous yellowish infillings. These features may contain seed coats, small bone or other undigested residues of the bird's food (Figure 34.14).

Due to the phosphate-rich composition of bird guano, it normally exhibits a pale yellow colour in PPL and is isotropic in XPL. Finally, we note the effects of bird nests, particularly of those made of mud by swallows, for example. While functioning they are attached to the roof/walls, but upon abandonment, they fall and become incorporated into the sediment often leading to puzzling interpretations of mud derived from a source not within the confines of the cave.

# 34.2.2.3 Herbivores

Domestic sheep and goats have been penned in Eurasian rock shelters since the Neolithic. Thus, herbivore faecal input has been widely documented in fumier installations from sites dating from the Neolithic, Bronze Age, up to the Middle Ages (see Shahack-Gross 2017, this book; Canti & Brochier 2017, this book; Bronniman et al. 2017b, this book). Although rare in older contexts, evidence of herbivore coprolites has also been described at some Palaeolithic rock shelter sites. For instance, the Middle Palaeolithic deposits from Lusakert, Armenia, contain low amounts of microscopic dung spherulites. They are contained in subrounded nodules of phosphatic appearance (Figure 34.15a, 15b). Further geochemical analyses are needed to corroborate its molecular composition. At El Salt, Spain, there is common herbivore dung in the form of spongy, fibrous coprolites comparable to those reported in Holocene stabling contexts (e.g., Matthews et al. 1997; Macphail et al. 1998; Macphail & Goldberg 2010 – Figure 34.15c and d).

# 34.2.2.4 Plants

Although plants do not usually grow deep within cave settings, they do in cave entrance areas or zones of rock shelters exposed to sunlight. Micromorphological evidence of plant growth includes calcitic root hypocoatings on clayey cave entrance sediment and less commonly pieces of primary tufa derived from breakdown of the ceiling/walls (Goldberg & Macphail 2012). At Gran Dolina, Spain, the presence of root hypocoatings indicated an advanced phase in degradation of the cave structure (Malol & Carbonell 2008). In addition, at Kebara and Hayonim, Israel, abundant accumulations of siliceous seed coatings of possibly Podonosma orientalis can be seen (E. Weiss, personal communication) (Figure 34.16); this species occupies rocky cliffs and is found on cave walls at entrance to cave today.

# 34.2.3 Anthropogenic Depositional Processes

Anthropogenic deposits are a considerable component of archaeological cave and rock shelter sites, and in some cases they constitute the majority of the cave infilling (e.g., Kebara: Goldberg et al. 2007). Processes and associated micromorphological features and fabrics include combustion features, bedding, and trampled sediment, both geogenic and anthropogenic, which have been studied mostly in Palaeolithic sites. These features are not archaeologically different from their open-air counterparts, except that they risk having been altered by postdepositional processes, described here. We do not include combustion structures and herbivore penning deposits, as these are thoroughly described by Mallol et al. 2017, this book, and Shahack-Gross 2017, this book.

# 34.2.3.1 Bedding

Ethnographic and ethnoarchaeological research in New Guinea has provided examples of human occupation of rock shelters in which living surfaces were covered with plants (Pétrequin & Pétrequin 1988). In archaeological contexts, plant bedding is rarely preserved except for sites in arid settings. Nevertheless, micromorphological evidence of bedding has been reported from the dry Middle Stone Age rock shelter site of Sibudu (S. Africa; Goldberg et al. 2009), where it is expressed as mm- tocm-thick layers of phytoliths, or charred plant material – or combinations thereof. Similar microfabrics have been reported from the Spanish Palaeolithic sites of Esquilleu (Cabanes et al. 2010) and Cendres (Bergadà et al. 2013). At Sibudu, experimental work has shown that the bedding installations were possibly burned for maintenance purposes (Miller & Sievers 2012). For detailed descriptions and images of burnt bedding microfabrics see Mallol et al. 2017, this book.

# 34.2.3.2 Trampled Occupation Debris

Microscopic features indicative of human or animal trampling are frequently identified in prehistoric cave sites (e.g., Gé et al. 1993; Dibble et al. 2009; Goldberg et al. 2009; Miller et al. 2013) and include compaction, fissuring, microaggregation and in situ crushing and scissor-fracturing of broken bone and charcoal (Courty et al. 1989; Goldberg et al. 2012; Mallol & Mentzer 2015; Rentzel et al. 2017, this book - Figure 34.17).

Commonly, trampling in caves takes place on dense, often clay-rich substrates. A few cases of archaeological occupation surfaces on loose, sandy substrates have been reported (Goldberg 2000; Macphail & Goldberg 2000). At Mandrin, France, archaeological Unit E - a massive sandy layer interpreted as a well preserved human occupation surface - yielded a microfabric of possible trampling on a loose, sandy surface. It consists of frequent well-sorted, sand-sized subrounded bone fragments (a few of which are vertically oriented), sand-sized flint

flakes and fissured larger bone fragments. These elements are concentrated at the top mm of the sedimentary layer on which the archaeological assemblage was found (Figure 34.18). Trampling experiments on clayey and sandy cave and rock shelter sedimentary surfaces are needed to understand the formation of trampled occupation deposits.

# 34.2.4 Physical Postdepositional Processes

Besides providing sedimentary material, the different agents of cave sedimentation described above (wind, water and animals, including humans) can also strongly modify existing deposits. Wind and water may erode, and syndepositionally sort and translocate light material lying on the surface. This material can be identified microscopically.

In addition, biological activity - including both plants and animals - can have a profound effect on deposits.

As discussed above, roots both displace sediments but serve as a locus of secondary minerals such as calcite hypocoatings. Soil mesofauna – including worms, various insects (mites, ants, termites and wasps) – can increase porosity and create crumb, microaggregate or granular microstructures, and at the same time allow for artefact movement (Kretzschmar 1987; Van Nest 2002; Canti 2003; Reatto et al. 2009; Sarcinelli et al. 2009 – see for example Figure 34.19a). On a larger scale, repeated burrowing by rodents can completely obliterate depositional structures and replace them with characteristic loose, aggregate microstructures (Figure 34.19b).

# 34.2.5 Chemical Postdepositional Processes

The type of textural pedofeatures found in cave sediments is strongly dependent upon fluctuations in their water content. Cave and rock shelter environments are normally subject to precipitation and dissolution of different minerals (particularly calcite, phosphates and gypsum) according to a variable, complex combination of factors including temperature, water content, pH, oxidation state, and ion concentration. Although the pathways of chemical reactions are specific to each context, it is safe to say that water is necessary to affect dissolution and precipitation. Therefore, identification of particular pedofeatures derived from precipitation or dissolution may be informative of the local conditions (overall wet climate, dripline position, localized puddles or karstic springs, as described in 2.1.3). In addition, they can provide information about pre-existing components of the deposits that might have dissolved under humid

conditions (e.g., bone, excrements and other sources of organic matter).

The first detailed multidisciplinary studies of postdepositional dissolution and precipitation of different minerals in archaeological contexts were carried out in the 1990s and 2000s in the Near Eastern Palaeolithic cave sites of Tabun, Kebara and Hayonim (Weiner et al. 1995; Schiegl et al. 1996, 2003; Karkanas et al. 2000). These works showed how the common presence of bat and bird guano in damp, enclosed caves and cave entrances in combination with other sources of decaying organic matter may strongly alter the chemical composition of bone and calcitic wood ash. In some cases, these elements may disappear altogether (references above). Thus, they showed how micromorphological and mineralogical characterization of diagenetic processes allows us to assess the degree of integrity of the archaeological record; a crucial task prior to interpreting the composition and spatial distribution of the remains. Since then, further studies focusing on this topic have contributed experimental and ethnoarchaeological data (e.g., Shahack-Gross 2004b).

# 34.2.5.1 Precipitation

Calcite As previously noted, secondary calcium carbonate precipitation is a common postdepositional phenomenon in caves and its occurrence can be linked to many different processes. Besides the common carbonate pedofeatures related to dripping and groundwater (see 1.1.3), others, such as primary travertine or flowstone, indicate highly saturated conditions (Figure 34.20a), or

primary tufa from calcium carbonate precipitation on plants growing on wet substrates (Garralda et al. 2014) or on the cave ceiling and walls. Travertine/flowstone and tufa can also be found in secondary position as roof spall after having been reworked syndepositionally from their source (e.g., in Obi-Rakhmat; Mallol et al. 2009). In such cases, they can be identified as clasts of variable shape (angular to rounded) depending on the degree of transport (Figure 34.20b, c and d). Their presence as stalactite clasts in deposits, for example, can signal the presence of a former cave roof, which in turn points to a more enclosed space.

Phosphates In archaeological cave sediments, phosphate mineralization is principally related to the presence of bird or bat guano, and is commonly associated with the dissolution of bone, ash, limestone, and other calcitic

elements. In cases of extreme diagenesis (e.g., Tabun and Hayonim Caves, Israel) phosphate diagenesis is associated with the breakdown of clays and the formation of opal (Goldberg & Nathan 1975; Karkanas et al. 1999; Karkanas & Goldberg 2010b; Weiner et al. 2002, 2007). Among postdepositional processes, phosphate diagenesis has been prominently studied and is increasingly better understood as micromorphology is coupled with geochemical analyses. In thin section, dahlite is the most abundant phosphate, and can occur, for example, as massive optically isotropic nodules, weathering rinds on limestone (see Figure 34.8), or as acicular and botryoidal crystals lining veins (Goldberg 1973; Rink et al. 2003). Other relatively common secondary phosphate minerals in prehistoric caves, such as crandellite, taranakite, leucophosphite and montgoryite, are much more difficult to identify

unequivocally in thin section because of the crystal size; variscite, however, is rare and vivianite with its blue and brown colours does not appear to occur in caves (for details, see Weiner et al. 1995, 2002; Karkanas & Goldberg 2010b).

Gypsum Gypsum is common in cave deposits although its mode of formation is not always clear. In some cases it occurs in association with degradation of bat guano (Shahack-Gross et al. 2004a), where it occurs as lozenge-shaped crystals; in alterations of recent surfaces at Tabun Cave, recent gypsum can be found as interlocking mosaics of silt-sized crystals. On the other hand, several prehistoric sites in South Africa (e.g., Diepkloof and Sibudu, South Africa) contain secondary gypsum, but the origin remains unclear. At Sibudu for example, gypsum occurs as lozenge shapes, needles and fine mosaic nodules, and in some cases is found within layers of phosphate-rich guano, which again points to association with guano alteration.

Other Minerals In addition to phosphates and gypsum, cave environments contain a wealth of secondary minerals (Hill & Forti 1997). We point out here just a couple more minerals that we have encountered or appear to be significant. One of the most striking features found in some of the most prominent prehistoric sites (e.g., Grotte XVI, Karkanas et al. 2002; Zhoukoudian, Goldberg et al. 2001; Theopetra, Karkanas et al. 1999; Pech de l'Aze IV and Roc de Marsal, Goldberg et al. 2012) is the presence of bright red layers or zones, which have commonly been taken to represent the reddening of the deposits by fire. Zhoukoudian is perhaps the foremost example of this phenomenon, where the red colour is still cited as representing among the earliest evidence of early use and control of fire. However, there, as well as Pech de l'Aze IV and Roc de Marsal, for example, the red colour can be shown to represent the precipitation of very fine silt-sized crystals of hematite that overprint the existing matrix and carbonate clasts (Figure 34.21a). Rather than being produced by fire, the bright red colour associated with the hematite appears to be related to the presence of organic matter, which is visible in the field at both Roc de Marsal and Pech de l'Aze IV.

Moreover, in association with the reddening of the deposits from the middle part of Layer 4 at Zhoukoudian (Goldberg et al. 2001), we find vugs with neoformed mosaic quartz crystals (Figure 34.21b and c). This precipitation appears to be related to the formation of secondary hematite after the cavity was open to the sky. In this case, leaching associated with monsoonal climates resulted in the breakdown of biotite and other iron-rich minerals, followed by iron and quartz precipitation.

# 34.2.5.2 Dissolution Features

Mineral dissolution is a common process in moist or wet cave and rock shelter contexts and has been documented by micromorphology at different sites (e.g., Goldberg et al. 2001; Karkanas et al. 2000, 2002; Weiner et al. 2002; Mallol et al. 2010, Miller et al. 2013). It commonly involves the same suite of minerals described in the previous section, and includes primary as well as secondarily precipitated minerals (e.g., dissolution of gypsum derived from organic matter degradation). Some minerals, such as gypsum and anhydrite, are more water-soluble than others and are likely to be readily dissolved. Thus, their presence in archaeological cave sediment indicates dry sedimentary environments. Often, their pseudomorphs are preserved within the sediment and can be identified microscopically (Figure 34.22).

Acidity (pH) is another important factor of mineral dissolution, and overall, carbonate minerals are susceptible to dissolution in acidic solutions. Among the most common dissolution features in karstic settings are decalcification zones, resulting from fluctuating pH and water content in calcitic sediments. In such cases, localized decalcified areas with sharp boundaries can be recognized (see Figure 34.1). Often, individual calcite crystals at the decalcification front exhibit serrated edges. Decalcification may also be observed in roofspall clasts, which might show internal dissolution vugs of variable size (see Figure 34.10).

In sum, caves – but to a lesser extent rock shelters that are more open – are vast sinks for biogenic (including anthropogenic) and geogenic materials. But, unlike open-air sites, their closed spaces foster certain conditions that can extensively modify depositional materials, both at the time of deposition but also after it. In fact, the whole suite of diagenetic changes that are virtually unique to the cave environment can be so extensive as to obliterate original depositional signatures and ultimately their interpretations.

# 34.3 Conclusion

Considering the role and importance of caves and rock shelters in human history – as well as their worldwide abundance – it is remarkable how few micromorphological studies have been undertaken. It is only in the past three or four decades that micromorphology has been used in new projects, and in the restudy of deposits from previously excavated sites. Although there are numerous reasons for this that cannot be discussed here, we simply mention that the extant ones have furnished remarkable evidence for past human environments and activities. In the future, in addition to carrying out more

micromorphological studies of specific caves, we recommend the following avenues for future research:

- More experimental studies are needed that involve specific human activities and deposits, as for example, in trampling and fire (Miller et al. 2009; Mallol et al., 2013a, 2013b) and the construction of bedding (Miller & Sievers 2012), all important human activities in the past.  
- More attempts to incorporate ethnoarchaeology to serve as essentially 'reference collections' and analogues to evaluate what has gone on in the past; in the past few years, however, researchers have realized the effectiveness of this strategy (Shahack-Gross 2004a; Mallol et al. 2007; Friesem et al. 2011, 2014). Moreover, this approach provides information on diagenesis and other processes that take too long to evaluate with experimentation.

- Greater integration of micromorphological observations with microstratigraphic analyses, such as microFTIR (see Berna 2017, this book), XRF (see Mentzer 2017, this book), XRD (see Berthold & Mentzer 2017, this book) and GC-MS (Sistiaga et al. 2014; see also Shillito 2017, this book). This multi-analytical approach provides for robust geoarchaeological information by linking contextualized analytical data with specific micromorphological signatures (Goldberg & Berna 2010).

Finally, we note that the promotion of books like this one provides visual micromorphological data to an ever increasing audience of archaeologists and natural scientists. After all, micromorphology is a visually intensive approach, and the more comprehensive the data set, the more accurate are our interpretations.

# 35.1 Introduction

By definition, micromorphology is the study of undisturbed soil materials with a microscope. The utmost care must therefore be taken to produce undisturbed samples. Three principal steps have to be considered: (i) sampling strategy (which samples to take and where to take them); (ii) sampling technique and instruments; (iii) transport and preservation of samples. Part of the following text is based on Stoops (1978). Other accounts on how to collect samples for micromorphology in archaeological contexts can be found in Courty et al. 1989; Macphail & Cruise 2000; Goldberg & Macphail 2003.

# 35.2 Sampling Strategy

For physical and chemical routine analyses, homogeneous bulk samples are necessary that represent, as closely as possible, the mean horizon characteristics. This, however, is not always true for micromorphology in general, and for archaeological soil micromorphology in particular.

In pedology, in order to determine the average characteristics of a horizon, a homogeneous sample is required, best taken in the middle of the horizon itself (Figure 35.1a). On the other hand, when sharp boundaries occur between horizons, sampling across boundaries, might be more informative (Figure 35.1b). A third possibility is collecting samples from specific features of interest, such as a certain nodule type, a tongue, and so forth (Figure 35.1c).

In archaeological contexts, the sampling strategy depends greatly on the specific feature(s) intended for analysis but even more on the question(s) asked of the soil micromorphologist. Proper questions are the necessary starting point for any meaningful micromorphological analysis carried out in an archaeological context.

This is especially true if one considers that archaeological stratigraphy does not rely exclusively on 'natural' - hence to some degree 'predictable' or 'replicable' - processes but also reflects 'the historical and social particularities of the people who created it' (Lucas 2012). Ideally, the sampling should be carried out by the micromorphologist who will study the thin sections, so that he/she can get an idea of the characteristics of the site. Micromorphology should not be considered as a stand-alone technique but rather as one of the different scales of observation of, or one of the available tools in, a multiscale geoarchaeological study. The questions for the soil micromorphologist should derive from discussion with the archaeologists and the other specialists involved in excavation (see for example Courty 2001; Macphail & Cruise 2001). The micromorphologist must be in charge of deciding where to take the samples, how to collect them, and how large they should be. The question of how many samples to collect is answered easily: the more the better, given time limits (especially in rescue archaeological contexts). It can be decided later which samples will be transformed in thin sections, based on the available budget and the research questions at the end of an excavation campaign. If properly stored (see section 35.5), samples can last a very long time and can be used to answer questions arising many years after the end of an archaeological project (see for example the study by Cremaschi & Ottomano 1996 on a stratigraphic column conserved for around a century in a museum). Moreover, undisturbed monoliths can also be used for analyses other than soil micromorphology.

Where samples should be taken is a difficult question that can only be answered case by case. All spots of interest should be sampled, including adequate coverage of the vertical stratigraphy and sometimes the lateral changes. In some cases, samples can be collected along the whole thickness of a layer or along a complete

succession of layers. This is the often the case when the aim is a detailed reconstruction of many superimposed events, represented by microstratified or laminated deposits (e.g., some caves sequences, combustion structures, superimposed floors, or certain waterlogged contexts). The whole thickness of dark earth units is normally sampled for micromorphology, as internal differentiations are most often invisible to the naked eye (see Nicosia et al. 2017, this book). In other cases, when for example questions concern only a general assessment of the composition of a layer, an 'average' sample in the middle, similarly to sampling in pedology (see above), will suffice. In other cases samples might need to be collected not only in the layer of interest but also from underlying ones, as for example in tilled horizons (where textural pedofeatures might form at depth below an ancient Ap horizon – see Deak et al. 2017, this book), or when assessing processes such as decarbonation, leaching or secondary mineral formation. The choice of the position of samples is therefore a very delicate step in an archaeological micromorphology study and should be dealt with by a trained specialist.

The size of the samples depends upon the aim of the study, the possibilities of the thin section workshop and budget considerations, taking into account that larger thin sections are much more expensive than small ones. When large blocks are sampled, it is possible to use only part of them for the thin section preparation and the remaining part for other analyses. For the study of structure and stratigraphy large thin sections are needed, whereas for materials (e.g., mortars, pottery, bones) petrographic sections  $(48 \times 28\mathrm{mm})$  are sufficient and, moreover, are easier to handle on a petrographic microscope.

For quantitative research, replicates may be necessary; either several thin sections of the same impregnated block, or one thin section of several samples taken in the same horizon or layer. Murphy & Banfield (1978) concluded that at least six samples with one thin section of  $7.5 \times 6\mathrm{cm}$  per sample are needed in quantitative porosity studies. In a similar study, Millfred et al. (Milfred et al. 1967) concluded that 21 cores of  $100\mathrm{cm}^3$  with two thin sections per core are needed for a statistically acceptable analysis of the six main components by point counting.

In the case of budgetary constraints, the best choice has to be made, trying to take samples illustrating more than one feature or point of interest. Care should ideally be taken to have an overlap of at least  $1\mathrm{cm}$  between successive samples, in order to obtain a complete profile section. A photograph of the sampling site, if possible with the sample boxes still in situ, or with an outline marked with the trowel on the profile is always very useful to reconstruct the original context. Samples should also be indicated on profile drawings, positioned by means of total station and recorded on stratigraphic unit forms, if these are compiled. This not only allows any researchers to know the exact position of each sample but, very importantly, facilitates communication with the others involved in an excavation.

Bulk samples for additional analysis (e.g., chemical, mineralogical and palynological) have to be taken in close association with micromorphological ones, so that they can be correlated with the thin section analysis.

# 35.3 Taking Samples in the Field

Most archaeological soils, sediments and associated earth materials are soft and not very coherent. Taking undisturbed samples therefore requires special techniques. A standard one is the use of so-called 'Kubiëna' boxes or tins, named after W. L. Kubiëna, the spiritual father of soil micromorphology, who invented this sampling method (Kubiëna 1953, not 1938 as sometimes mentioned). The original Kubiëna box is made of bladed aluminium, later also stainless steel, brass or zinc were used (Figures 35.2, 35.3 and 35.4). Its standard size is  $80\mathrm{mm}$  long,  $65\mathrm{mm}$  wide and  $40\mathrm{mm}$  thick, but measures vary according to the dimensions of the thin sections expected to be made. Both the upper and the lower cover can be removed and the sides are closed with a hinge that can be opened to allow an easy removal of the sample without pushing. Larger boxes of  $150\times 80\times 50\mathrm{mm}$  were used by several laboratories preparing so-called mammoth thin sections (Jongerius & Heintzberger 1975).

To take a sample, one cover is removed and the open box pressed into the soil. One should never try to force the box in the soil with a hammer as this may both

damage the box and the microfabric of the soil by vibration. In a soil pit, a car jack, placed between the box and the opposite wall, can be used to force the box in the profile wall. When the material is too hard or compact to introduce the box just by hand pressure, a deep groove needs to be cut along the sides of the box. A pair of scissors is useful in the case of surface horizons with roots. During the introduction of the box into the soil,

fragments may separate and obstruct the lower part of the box. They should be removed before continuing pressing the box in the soil, by opening the second cover. Once the box is completely filled, it is removed from the profile wall by means of a knife or a spade put behind it. The excess of soil should not be pushed in the box, as this will certainly alter the microstructure, but it should be cut off carefully with a knife. When the box cannot be introduced deeply enough so as to be completely filled, the empty space should be filled with cotton wool (or in the field provisionally with dried grass, moss, or crumpled paper).

Samples can also be collected by simply digging out or 'carving' a block of the desired size from the profile (Figures 35.5 and 35.6). The block should be infolded first in paper (either toilet paper, Scottex, or newspaper) and then wrapped tight with tape until it feels very firm. Paper is preferable to aluminium or plastic film as it absorbs part of the water present in the sample. Another option is to place the carved-out monolith in a

plastic box. Care should be always taken to mark the 'way up' of the sample and its name on the box (Figure 35.7). The boxes can be then eventually wrapped in paper and tape. Carving is an ideal technique when materials are rich in gravel or in artefacts (as is often the case in archaeology), are particularly firm, or have a strongly separated soil structure. Josephs & Bettis (2003) describe, as an alternative to the classical Kubiëna boxes, the use of nonmetallic outlet and switch boxes (after removal of nail hooks). These boxes are pushed or hammered in the soil. Note that vibrations can be harmful for the

microstructure. As samples are difficult to remove from these boxes, they are generally impregnated within the boxes. Another alternative is proposed by Goldberg & Macphail (2003). For obtaining undisturbed monolith type samples they use square section PVC downpipe. The pipe is cut in convenient lengths, easy to transport (e.g., 10 to  $40\mathrm{cm}$ ). The complete pipe can be pushed or hammered vertically in the soil. Cutting one side yields a pipe with a U profile that can be cut into the wall with a knife, and is especially useful when large soil columns are collected (Figure 35.8).

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/bedc544e-6532-4e7f-9c47-701c6e06b76e/ca562976b22f207d146850b7514891c5d976cf6df362839f7015728b435c7ba9.jpg)

Noncoherent samples (such as loose sands or ash) are difficult to sample when dry, even with boxes. It can sometimes be helpful to moisten them. Several methods have been proposed to stabilize the material prior to sampling. Goldberg (1976) proposed stabilizing clods of fragile materials by applying drops of water glass (sodium silicate solution) from an eye dropper over the entire surface. After drying in the sun (for about  $1\mathrm{h}$ ) the sample is sufficiently hard to be packed. Only the outer rim of the clad will be hardened in this way, leaving the entire interior for impregnation in the laboratory. Another consolidation of samples in situ can be achieved with a  $0.5\%$  cellulose acetate solution in acetone, applied several times to the profile wall. The solution is prepared by dissolving small pieces of cellulose in acetone (Murphy 1986). It can be atomized on a vertical wall of the profile, or dripped on a horizontal platform. After evaporation of the acetone, the surface of the sample will be stable.

In very dry soils, stabilization in the field may be possible by impregnating the material in situ with diluted polystyrene (as used for impregnation of samples in the laboratory, but a shorter hardening time), as proposed by Bisdom (1967). This provisional impregnation may, however, later hinder the final impregnation in the laboratory. For the same purpose, Prone (1976) used a modified resin and propylene oxide, both mixable with water. Obtaining these products is however not easy.

Blevins et al. (1968) described a method for fixing the samples in the field by freezing with liquid nitrogen  $(-78^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$  that is poured into small holes surrounding the sample location. The sample needs to be transported in frozen condition to the laboratory. Apart from the technical problems, disruption of the sample by ice crystallization cannot be excluded.

For the study of soil surfaces (e.g., a ploughed surface) FitzPatrick et al. (1985) recommend the use plaster of Paris: a quarter mixture of water and plaster of Paris is slowly poured in a metallic frame partly inserted into the soil surface. After hardening, the frame containing the soil and the plaster crust can be excavated and packed.

Another possibility for particularly loose and/or delicate materials is to wrap the sample in gypsum bandages, which are made of cotton embedded in plaster of Paris, and are easily available in pharmacies (Figures 35.9 and 35.10). They need to be wetted, wrapped around the sample and left to dry. In very wet environmental conditions the hardening could be problematic. If pre-embedded bandages are not available, rough textile dripped in a plaster of Paris solution can be used for the same purpose. Small amounts of acrylic polymer (e.g., Polyfilla) can be added to increase hardness (Goldberg & Macphail 2003).

# 35.4 Labelling

Correct labelling of each sample is of primary importance. Two pieces of information are important:

- The number of the sample, corresponding to the number(s) given in the field description, drawings or photographs. In order to facilitate communication with the excavation team and with other specialist, the stratigraphic unit number of the sampled layer can be indicated on the sample. Unnecessary long or complicated sample labels should be avoided, as they make transcription mistakes during or after processing more likely.

- The exact orientation. The latter can be indicated by the words 'top' and 'bottom', or by an arrow pointing to the top written directly on the sample. An arrow can be scratched on blocks made of coherent but soft material. It is important to use a water-resistant marker and to mark label and orientation on more than one face of

the sample, as vapours during processing can cause the writing to disappear. Kubiëna boxes are best labelled on the side, not on one of the covers, as the latter often will be removed in the laboratory for drying.

# 35.5 Transport and Preservation

The influence of transport on sample quality is frequently underestimated especially when samples were taken in remote areas.

# 35.5.1 Preparing Samples for Transport

# 35.5.1.1 Monitoring the Moisture Content

For specific types of samples, preservation or regulation of the moisture content is very important. When relatively loose samples (e.g., sandy materials) become dry before or during transport, the cohesion between the particles may be lost, in which case only a loose stuctureless material will be left. Samples containing hygroscopic salts have to be kept at the original moisture content to avoid mineralogical changes by absorption or a loss of crystal water. For instance, mirabilite  $\mathrm{(Na_2SO_4.10H_2O)}$  can be transformed to thenardite  $\mathrm{(Na_2SO_4)}$  or vice versa.

Transporting oversaturated soil material should be avoided, as vibrations may destroy the fabric, especially in the case of thixotropic material. Controlled drying to acceptable moisture content to enhance cohesion will be necessary but care should be taken that the sample does not become completely dry. Complete drying of clayey samples will cause artificial cracks and often a considerable shrinkage of the material. In the case of peat, fragments of leather etc., drying may result not only in a change of the fabric, but also in changes of the optical characteristics as the material becomes almost opaque after air or oven drying.

To keep the desired moisture content, sampled blocks and Kubiëna boxes have to be wrapped in plastic sheets

or long plastic bags and closed hermetically. This will also avoid oxidation (e.g., in the case of hydromorphic soils).

# 35.5.1.2 Precautions against Biological

# Degradation

The presence of mesofauna in a sample may result after some days in the total loss of microstructure. This is especially the case for samples rich in organic material. Fungi may also cause problems. It might therefore be useful to add a few drops of fungicide or formalin to the samples before wrapping them.

# Fluorescence Microscopy

Georges Stoops

Vakgroep Geologie, Faculteit Wetenschappen, Universiteit Gent, Belgium

# 36.1 Principles of the Analytical Method

The absorption of radiation and subsequent emission of light with a longer ('warmer') wavelength is called fluorescence or phosphorescence. In the case of fluorescence the reradiation is almost simultaneous; in the case of phosphorescence the emission persists longer after the excitation. In earth sciences, primary fluorescence or autofluorescence is mostly used – the fluorescence emitted by the material as such. In biological and medical sciences secondary fluorescence is more commonly used: fluorescence emitting substances, called fluochromes, are selectively absorbed on specific substances making their detection easier using UV or blue light. For porosity studies in soils and rocks a fluochrome is mixed to the impregnating resin, making distinction between solid material and voids clearly visible for image analysis.

# 36.2 Sampling and Analytical Procedure

In material sciences only (oblique) incident radiation (called epifluorescence) of short wavelengths (ultraviolet or UV, violet, blue) is used, whereas in medical and biological sciences transmitted blue or UV light is more commonly used. To obtain a sufficient strong irradiation a mercury burner (HBO) of  $50 - 200\mathrm{W}$ , or a xenon burner (XBO) of  $75 - 100\mathrm{W}$  is needed. The required wavelength is isolated with the help of an excitation filter, blocking all but the selected exciting wavelength, or, rarely a prism monochromator. In order to observe the fluorescence a suppression or barrier filter is used, blocking the exciting wavelength and thus separating the object emission from the reflected excitation light. If the white light of

the mercury or xenon burner is used to study the thin section in OIL, it is most important to insert a sufficiently thick colourless UV stop filter to protect the eyes.

Epifluorescence microscopes are equipped with the necessary light source and a set of excitation and suppression filters. Most research microscopes can be transformed for fluorescence studies by adding accessories, as far as the microscope has the possibilities for (oblique) incident light illumination. Most HBO and XBO lamp houses are equipped with filter holders to contain excitation filters. The suppression filters fit in a filter turret or filter holder in the microscope tube between the sample and the ocular system. Special accessory units containing both types of filters in revolving fittings are commercially available for some microscopes. For more technical details the reader is referred to technical manuals such as Ploem & Tanke (1987) and Nikon (1990).

To obtain the best results, the right match between excitation and suppression filters is of primary importance (Table 36.1).

Although epifluorescence microscopy can be applied to fresh fracture surfaces, better results are obtained on polished impregnated blocks, uncovered thin sections and even glass-covered thin sections. If, in the case of uncovered thin sections, oil is applied to the surface to enhance contrast and colour, care should be taken to select a nonfluorescent oil. Fluochromes added to the impregnating resin (e.g., to study porosity) or autofluorescence of the resin (e.g., in the case of some polystyrene resins) may interfere with the autofluorescence of solid components.

It is recommended that work should be carried out in a relative dark room to avoid the interference of light reflections on the thin section and for a better observation of the often weak emissions. Not all digital microscope cameras are sufficiently sensitive to make pictures of weak autofluorescence.

A special case of fluorescence is so-called cathodoluminescence (CL). Instead of incident UV or blue light, a beam of electrons is used to excite the sample. This requires special equipment to be mounted on the microscope table. A metal vacuum chamber containing the electron gun and sample holder is equipped with two glass windows, one at the bottom to allow light to enter for observations in transmitted light and

<table><tr><td>Exciting radiation</td><td>Excitation filter (nm)</td><td>Suppression filter (nm)</td></tr><tr><td>Ultraviolet</td><td>330–380</td><td>420</td></tr><tr><td>Blue violet</td><td>400–440</td><td>480</td></tr><tr><td>Blue</td><td>420–490</td><td>520</td></tr></table>

one at the top for observation. The chamber is connected to a vacuum pump and a high voltage source furnishing the power for the electron gun. Two types of guns are available, the relatively weak 'cold' gun, sufficient however for the study of carbonates, phosphates, and so forth, and the 'hot' gun necessary for the study of silicates (mainly quartz) grains. Some SEM systems or microprobes are equipped with an optical CL device.

Thin sections should be uncovered and of small size (generally petrographic size, i.e.  $48 \times 28\mathrm{mm}$ ), as the sample holder does not allow larger sections to be introduced.

Cathodoluminescence intensity is a function of the concentration of the activator 'impurity' in the crystal lattice but other elements, called quenchers (e.g., Fe) have an opposite role and reduce or inhibit the luminescence (Marchal 1988; Barbin & Schvoerer 1997).

# 36.3 Applications in Archaeology

The use of fluorescence microscopy in soil and regolith micromorphology is summarized in Stoops (2003). More details are given in Van Vliet-Lanoë (1980). Application to archaeological materials is very promising and is discussed in general by Macphail et al. (2004) and Macphail & Goldberg (2010). For illustrations, the reader is referred to the cited chapters in this book.

- Many phosphate minerals show autofluorescence. The technique is very useful in the detection of bone fragments dispersed in the deposits (Villagran et al. 2017, this book), of excrements of carnivores or omnivores (Nicosia 2008; Karkanas & Goldberg 2010; Brönniman et al. 2017a, this book; Karkanas 2017, this book). Bones give a greenish yellow fluorescence when excited with blue light and a light-blue fluorescence with UV light (Figure 36.1), influenced by degree and type of preservation.  
Calcium carbonates (calcite, aragonite) are frequently fluorescent, the colour and intensity changing in function of the activators present (e.g., Mn). The technique therefore can help to distinguish different layers in nodules or coatings, for instance calcite coatings on pottery or rock fragments (Dravis & Yurewiz 1985; Khormali et al. 2006 - Figure 36.2). Calcite phytoliths are also often fluorescent (Altemüller & Van Vliet-Lanoë 1990). According to the experience of the author, fluorescence of shells can change after heating. This topic needs however further detailed study.  
- The use of fluorescence for the study of organic materials in soil thin sections was discussed by Babel (1972) and Altemüller & Van Vliet-Lanoë (1990). Lignified tissue has a strong brown colour with UV excitation; cutinized and suberized cells and also hyphen have a whitish colour with UV; parachymatic tissues emit a brownish or reddish colour when excited with blue light. Young cells in root tips and root hairs display a blue colour in UV. Humification changes fluorescence colours and intensities of organic tissues (e.g., in lignified tissues fluorescence colour changes gradually to whitish and will finally disappear). Moreover, humic compounds mask autofluorescence. This can be overcome partly by treating the uncovered thin section with sodium hypochlorite to bleach the humic components (Babel 1964; Stoops 2003). In archaeology, it is used especially for the study of plant remains (Ismail-Meyer 2017, this book) and herbivore excrements (Bronniman et al. 2017b, this book).  
- Phytoliths can be fluorescent under specific conditions, for instance in Podzols and volcanic ash soils (Van Vliet-Lanoë 1980).

Cathodoluminescence has been used in soil micromorphology mainly for the study of carbonates, as it often allows to distinguish lithogenic from pedogenic calcite features (e.g., Khormali et al. 2006; Wright & Peeters 1989), or different gentic types of nodules. In geology a much wider use has been made, as for example to distinguish between igneous and metamorphic quartz. In archaeology the use of cathodoluminescence is still limited (Schvoerer et al. 1986), having been employed in the study of building materials (Barbin et al. 1992), mortars, coprolites (Le Bailly et al. 2006). As also shells show a different CL signal depending upon the environment of growth (Barbin 1997), the method could be useful for detection of shells of different origins.

# 36.4 Concluding Remarks

Fluorescence microscopy is a simple method, requiring only some accessories to adapt a research microscope. It is therefore quite frequently used in archaeological micromorphology, mainly to detect vegetal residues and phosphatic remains. More research is needed for instance on its use to identify fibres (e.g. from textiles), and the influence of fire and burning on bones, shells and other materials. Its use in research on bricks, tiles, pottery and mortars and plasters is almost nonexistent.

Although cathodoluminescence is a relatively common technique in geoarchaeology, its use in micromorphology is still restricted. It might be a powerful tool in the study of carbonates, phosphates and so forth but has been strongly underused up to now.

# Gas Chromatography – Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS)

# 37.1 Principles of the Analytical Method

Gas chromatography – mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is a technique that combines gas chromatography (GC), which separates the components of a mixture, and mass spectrometry (MS), which identifies specific individual components of that mixture. The gas chromatograph consists of a thin capillary column selected for its specific dimensions (length, diameter, film thickness) and phase properties. Molecules in the GC are retained by the column and come off at different times, known as retention times. The resulting chromatograph is a plot of time against relative intensity of the different molecules, with each peak representing a different molecule. When used by itself, identification by GC is based entirely on the retention time of compounds; however, it is not as powerful for complex samples as multiple compounds may have similar retention times. The retention time depends largely on the difference in chemical properties between substances in a sample and their affinity for the column. Substances with a greater affinity stay on the column for longer. When combined with the MS, each individual analyte is broken into ionized fragments, which are detected using their mass-to-charge ratio,  $\mathrm{m/z}$ . This process enables identification of compounds based on their total mass and unique fragmentation pattern, or mass spectrum (Figure 37.1). For further reading on GC see Fowlis (1995), which deals with the theory of gas chromatography and application of the methods, and McMaster (2008) which discusses GC/MS, including equipment maintenance, fundamentals of the technique and a wide range of applications. More basic overviews for archaeologists can be found in Pollard et al. (2007) and Pollard & Heron (2008). For a review of organic biomarker analysis in archaeology, see Evershed (2008).

# 37.2 Sampling and Analytical Procedure

The method for extracting organic residues varies depending on the type of molecules expected. The most basic procedure is a straightforward solvent extraction, either by sonication, Soxhlet extraction or accelerated solvent extraction (ASE). These are different methods for removing the organic residue from the soil/sediment matrix. Further procedures can be conducted to split this total extract into separate chemical groups. The extract may also need to be chemically altered to make it more volatile and suitable for analysis by GC/MS. Insoluble fractions may be investigated using pyrolysis GC/MS (Py/GC/MS), where the soil/sediment is directly combusted without prior extraction.

The advantage of GC/MS is its specificity. Unlike other geochemical techniques, GC/MS results provide an absolute value in that the specific organic molecule present is identified. This is based on the unique mass spectrum of the molecule. Identification is made by comparing the spectra with a mass spectral library, though the identification can be achieved by hand with knowledge of fragmentation patterns.

Analysis is carried out on loose sediment, which should be collected from the micromorphology block prior to resin impregnation, or directly adjacent, to enable direct comparison between microscopic observation and GC/MS data. Alternatively, the block could be split and one part stored for future subsampling. Normally the thin section should be studied first, to target layers that would benefit from further analysis by GC/MS. The larger the sample, the easier the analysis, as a greater quantity of residue can be extracted. Smaller sample sizes may produce insufficient residue to quantify. A minimum of  $1\mathrm{g}$  is recommended for materials such

as coprolites or humic soils where residues are more concentrated. For mineral soils and sediment samples  $10\mathrm{g}$  is recommended. For Py/GC/MS  $1 - 3\mathrm{mg}$  is sufficient. A good example discussing different methods for residue extraction from soils is the organic residue study of the Rothamsted Classical Experiments (van Bergen et al. 1997; Bull et al. 1998). Careful sampling of microlayers can provide extremely high resolution results; for example, microsampling of alternate layers of trampled sediments, identified in thin sections of early Neolithic deposits in the Central Zagros (Figure 37.1), revealed alternating deposits of human and animal faeces (Shillito et al. 2013b). In this sense the method is destructive but sampling can be carried out directly from blocks before impregnation, so does not add any further to the destruction from production of a thin section.

Results are semiquantitative. Analysis should be carried out using a reference standard, a known amount of which is added during residue extraction. Recovered values can then be compared to this reference to provide

an estimate of relative concentrations. The reference standard should have a similar composition to the molecules under investigation.

The major limitation of the technique is that it is time consuming and expensive and requires a relatively specialized laboratory setup. Interpretation of results requires an understanding of organic geochemistry. Although specific molecules are identified, this does not always mean a straightforward identification, as some organic compounds can occur in many different materials, for example cholesterol. GC/MS is also limited to volatile compounds, though a range of other chromatographic techniques, such as liquid chromatography (LC/MS), are available for other types of compounds.

When sampling, precautions should be taken to avoid contamination, for example with organic residues present on the hands but also from the sampling kit. Plastics are particularly prone to contaminating GC traces, and samples should preferably be stored in glass jars, paper bags and/or wrapped in foil. Although peaks from

plastics are easily identifiable, they can potentially overlap with compounds of interest and 'swamp' the spectra. In the laboratory, all equipment should be furnaced and solvent rinsed before use.

# 37.3 Archaeological Applications

Gas chromatography - mass spectrometry can be used whenever it is necessary to identify specific organic components within soil or sediment, which are ambiguous under the microscope. These may include human and animal faeces, waxes and resins, combustion products and the composition of decayed plant remains for example. The combination of organic geochemical identification with microcontextual information in thin section is a powerful means of investigating formation processes of

deposits and use of space within sites and settlements. The identification of absolute biomarkers is especially important in cases where ambiguities arise in visual identification, for example species of coprolite. A combined study of lipid residues and micromorphology at the Neolithic site of Catalhöyük, for example, demonstrated that deposits that appear similar microscopically can have a different organic composition (Shillito et al. 2011; Shillito et al. 2013a).

(2013), which identified that black layers associated with Middle Palaeolithic combustion features were occupation surfaces rather than combustion deposits.

# 38.1 Principles of the Analytical Method

Many analytical techniques – beyond optical petrography – can be applied to micromorphological samples, which include thin sections and resin-impregnated sediment blocks. A relatively recent development, the use of stable isotope mass spectrometry on powders drilled from archaeological sediment blocks was first reported in Mentzer & Quade (2013).

Analyses of the stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen in carbonate minerals have many applications in archaeological science. Isotope ratios, normalized to an international standard, have been measured in cave speleothems, and lacustrine, soil and biogenic carbonates for the purposes of paleoenvironmental reconstruction in or near archaeological sites (Cerling & Quade 1993; Sikes 1994; Frumkin et al. 1999; Leng & Marshall 2004; McDermott 2004; Hodell et al. 2005; Pustovoytov et al. 2010; Quade et al. 2014); in wood ashes for the purposes of identification as well as understanding fuel sources and combustion temperatures (Shahack-Gross et al. 2008; Shahack-Gross & Ayalon 2013); in lime plasters to understand production sequences (Kosednar-Legenstein et al. 2008); in marble and limestone for sourcing studies (Herz 1992; Wenner & Herz 1992; Attanasio et al. 2006) and in enamel carbonates for reconstructing hominin subsistence behaviours (Sponheimer & Lee-Thorp 1999). Each of these types of studies takes advantage of the fact that the relative abundances of isotopes of carbon and oxygen vary in predicable ways due to equilibrium and kinetic fractionation (Sharp 2007).

Typically, geoarchaeologists wishing to conduct both micromorphological analyses and stable isotopic measurements collect separate samples. Loose samples of carbonates or other materials can be collected in the vicinity

of an oriented sediment block or can be removed from its exposed face prior to resin impregnation. Micromorphological observations then provide general information about the sample context. This approach has limitations when the target material is heterogeneous in source, distribution, composition or state of preservation. For example, loose samples collected from a laminated calcareous deposit, such as the ash layer of a multiphase hearth, will likely span several microscopic depositional units. Geochemists working with similar materials, such as speleothems and corals, have developed several microsampling strategies. Microdrilling, which is the targeted removal of several micrograms of solid sample using a very thin drill bit, can be conducted on micromorphology samples. Isotopic analysis of the resulting powder proceeds via a mass spectrometer.

At present, the microdrilling technique described here has not been used to obtain samples for measuring the isotopes of carbon and oxygen in carbonate minerals besides calcite and aragonite, other materials or compounds (e.g., carbon in charcoal, or carbon bound to phosphate groups within enamel), or other isotopic systems (e.g., H, S, N) in an archaeological setting. Whether the microdrilling technique can be used for other systems is dependent on the target material, the method of isotope extraction, and whether this method removes elements from only the target material, or from both the target material and resin. Use of other types of instrumentation for in situ isotopic measurements, such as laser ablation methods that generate gas (e.g., GC-IRMS; see Sharp & Cerling 1996; Spötl & Mattey 2006) may be possible; however the effects of resin on the evolved gas must first be tested. Methods that generate ions (e.g., laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry and laser microprobe mass spectrometry) are not appropriate for silt- and clay-sized particles embedded

in resin, because the instrument will analyse both the sample and the resin. Laser ablation may be used on coarser materials that do not contain resin, such as fragments of limestone or shell.

# 38.2 Sampling and Analytical Procedure

# 38.2.1 Stable Isotopes of Carbon and Oxygen in Carbonates

The basic analytical procedure for measurements of stable isotopic ratios of carbon and oxygen in bulk samples of carbonates is as follows. A subsample of the target material is obtained and ground to a fine powder. The power may be roasted at a temperature of  $250^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  in order to remove organic material. The powder is then reacted with phosphoric acid to yield carbon dioxide  $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$  using either an automated system with a common acid bath, or individual acid baths and gas aliquots. The  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  is fed via an inlet into an isotope ratio gas mass spectrometer (IRMS), which measures, by mass ratio, the abundance of the different isotopic species of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  distinguished by mass (e.g., 44, 45, 46) relative to those in  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  generated from an internal laboratory standard (measured at the same time if using a dual inlet system). Finally, the abundances of the isotopes are reported in parts per thousand  $(\%)$  using delta notation  $(\delta)$  relative to the external international standard, the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB) formation. This method is applicable, with modification to the reaction conditions, to several types of carbonate compounds and minerals in solid form (Al-Aasm et al.

1990) including calcium carbonate (calcite and aragonite) and calcium magnesium carbonate (dolomite).

# 38.2.2 Microdrilling

The microdrilling technique featured here differs very little from the standard analytical procedure on bulk samples described above. Microdrilling as a method of subsample extraction has been applied widely in studies of speleothems (e.g., Spötl & Mattey 2006). Stabilization of fragile samples in resin is a common step in the isotopic subsampling of corals (e.g., Leder et al. 1996; McConnaughey et al. 1997). In micromorphological samples, a carbonate subsample for isotopic analysis can be obtained by drilling target material directly from a sliced, resin-impregnated sediment block or, for better correlation with micromorphological observations, the tile or chip that was used to produce a thin section (Figure 38.1). The sampling workstation contains a handheld drill, stationary drill, or a digitally automated drilling system (Dettman & Lohman 1995) equipped with various sizes of dental drill bits, as well as an illuminated magnifier. Drilling produces powder that can be captured manually using a scalpel and weighing paper. The drill bit and scalpel should be cleaned chemically prior to collection of subsequent samples and all powder from previous sample holes should be evacuated using compressed air. The procedure is destructive to small areas of the resin-impregnated block or tile (see Figure 38.1a). For a detailed comparison of different sampling techniques, see Spötl & Mattey (2006).

The minimum sample size that can be analysed is dependent on the diameter of the drill bit (typically

0.3–0.8 mm), the percentage of carbonate in the resulting powder and the specifications of the instrumentation, including whether the production of the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  is automated using a common acid bath. In some archaeological samples, drilling large quantities of powder may not be an option. For example, in microlaminated samples, the maximum sample size may be constrained by the individual layer thickness and its lateral extent within the sample. Finally, it should be noted that the target area should be homogeneous in composition to 1–2 mm depth from the drilling surface. Following drilling, the sample may be powdered further if needed, and analyses proceed as above on powders composed of a mixture of carbonate and resin. Mortensen et al. (1998) and Mentzer & Quade (2013) have evaluated the possible contributions of the resin to the evolved gas and have found none.

# 38.2.3 Mass Spectrometry

It is strongly recommended that analyses of microdrilled samples be conducted with an automated preparation system, such as a Kiel Carbonate Device (Thermo Scientific). This type of device is optimized for carbonates, and automates and conducts the acid reactions online (attached directly to the mass spectrometer), small samples (e.g.,  $< 25\mu \mathrm{g}$ ) can be analysed and higher analytical precisions may be attained. In the case of carbonates drilled from resin-impregnated archaeological sediments, the ability to analyse small samples is particularly important, especially when targeting anthropogenic carbonates. Geogenic and biogenic carbonates, such as speleothem fragments, soil carbonates and shells are relatively dense and pure. In contrast, anthropogenic carbonates, such as lime plaster and wood ashes, are typically mixed with other materials and therefore contain lower percentages of carbonate. Furthermore, these materials are porous and a greater proportion of the microdrilled sample will be composed of resin. The results of isotopic analyses of three different types of materials - both microdrilled powders and comparable loose sediment samples - are illustrated in Figure 38.2.

For comparative purposes, several types of carbonate from two archaeological sites were sampled and analysed using different techniques (Figure 38.2). First, calcareous materials from a cave in North America were collected as both loose samples and microdrilled powders. Geogenic carbonates (speleothem fragments and bedrock) contain 84.0 to  $98.4\%$  carbonate. When the same materials are embedded in resin and microdrilled using the procedures described above, the resulting powders contain similar percentages of carbonate due to the high crystal density of the materials. Loose samples of calcareous sediment from the same site contain 18.9 to  $55.6\%$

carbonate due to the presence of inclusions such as organic material and mineral silt. When the same calcareous sediment is embedded in resin and microdrilled as described above, the resulting powder contains 5.8 to  $29.4\%$  carbonate, owing to dilution of the material by resin. This difference in carbonate abundance resulted in low precision of some isotopic measurements on the microdrilled powders. In samples with low carbonate abundance, errors were as high as  $0.4\%$ , oxygen. In this case, measurements were conducted on  $100 - 400\mu \mathrm{g}$  of powder using a Finnigan MAT 252 IRMS equipped with a Thermo Scientific Gasbench II continuous flow device but without an autosampler. Resin-impregnated, microdrilled samples exhibit greater overall analytical error than loose samples analysed with the same instrument (see Figure 38.2). Second, a different set of resin-impregnated powder samples from a Neolithic site in Turkey (Mentzer & Quade 2013) were collected from microlaminated calcareous features and were processed using different techniques. The measurements were compared to the cave samples from above. The powders ranged in mass from  $10 - 100\mu \mathrm{g}$  depending on purity. These samples were also analysed using a Finnigan MAT 252 IRMS. However, this instrument was equipped with a Kiel-III device and the resulting measurements have precisions of  $0.1\%$  and  $0.08\%$  for carbon and oxygen. This comparison demonstrates that automated sampling systems provide better precision for resin-impregnated, microdrilled powders when carbonate abundance is low.

# 38.3 Archaeological Applications

Stable carbon and oxygen isotopic analyses of biogenic, geogenic and pedogenic carbonates using mass spectrometry is a well-established field of study. As described above, applications of isotopic analysis to calcareous archaeological materials are also numerous but are typically conducted on loose samples, which limits the ability of micromorphologists to provide information about the context or conditions of preservation. At present, microdrilling of micromorphological samples has been applied to only a few sites, with publication of results limited to Mentzer & Quade (2013). This sampling strategy shows great promise for projects that emphasize a microcontextual approach to the study of anthropogenic deposits (Matthews 2005; Goldberg & Berna 2010). For example, the analyses of samples drilled from plaster floors revealed that the carbon and oxygen isotopic values could readily distinguish between lime and ashes as the sources of carbonate (Mentzer & Quade 2013). In addition, there are many hypothetical situations in which microdrilling of carbonates from resin-impregnated blocks of archaeological sediment might be useful or preferred over other

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-03/bedc544e-6532-4e7f-9c47-701c6e06b76e/8933ddea081be4de555bff75904068d204fa2f5b6ae396c47cb25265b23aff89.jpg)  
Figure 38.2 Isotopic measurements on both resin-impregnated and loose calcareous sediments from two archaeological sites indicate that the results are comparable. Nineteen microdrilled samples were obtained from Site 1, a limestone cave located in the USA (Sierra Diablo Cave, unpublished data produced by H. Martinez-Dyrzo in collaboration with J. Vasquez and V. T. Holliday). An example of a microdrilled thin section tile from Pleistocene calcareous deposits in this site is illustrated in Figure 38.1(b). Loose samples of the calcareous sediment contain 18.9 to  $55.6\%$  carbonate due to the presence of inclusions such as organic material and mineral silt. When the same calcareous sediment is embedded in resin and microdrilled, the resulting powder contains 5.8 to  $29.4\%$  carbonate, owing to dilution of the material by resin. This difference in carbonate abundance resulted in low precision of some isotopic measurements on the microdrilled powders. Error bars for these samples are larger than the data points. The measurements (light green squares), yielded oxygen and carbon isotopic values that range from  $-10.59$  to  $-0.46$  and  $-12.09$  to  $-5.30\%$  VPDB (with a maximum of  $0.4\%$  error), respectively. In comparison, analyses of five loose sediment samples from the same stratigraphic unit obtained in various locations within the cave yielded oxygen and carbon isotopic values that range from  $-20.09$  to 0.75 and  $-18.07$  to  $-2.95\%$  VPDB, respectively. Both types of samples show a clear and strong positive linear correlation between oxygen and carbon ( $R^2 = 0.9509$  for the microdrilled samples,  $R^2 = 0.9646$  for the loose samples). Two microdrilled samples from thin section tiles from Site 2, a Neolithic tell located in Turkey (Aşkı Lohyuk, data reproduced from Mentzer & Quade 2013) contain calcareous ash (light orange triangles) and exhibit oxygen and carbon isotopic ratios that are similar to those from seven loose sediment samples (dark orange triangles). Likewise, the single measurement on microdrilled lime from Site 2 (light blue diamond) is in good agreement with the results obtained on seven loose samples of lime. The samples from Site 2 were prepared with a Kiel device and ranged in mass from 10 to  $100\mu g$ . In comparison, the samples from Site 1 were prepared without a Kiel device and ranged in mass from 100 to  $400\mu g$ .

methods (Figure 38.3). These situations can arise from bulk sampling limitations, as well as from the presence of strongly laminated sediment, heterogeneous materials or postdepositional alteration.

First, the isotopic subsampling strategy may be constrained to microdrilling of resin-impregnated blocks due to the fact that loose samples were not collected or that the feature of interest is not present in the loose samples. This limitation might arise when conducting new analyses on old, archived samples. In addition, some types of samples are highly cemented by secondary carbonates or silica, which could prevent subsampling of calcareous components using other methods (Figure 38.3d).

Second, complicated microstratigraphy could hinder accurate sampling of individual calcareous layers or features

in the field. Examples of these types of archaeological sediments include plaster layers in a floor (Figure 38.3a), and thin yet discrete layers of calcareous ashes in a combustion feature (Figure 38.3b and c). In these situations, loose samples of the feature's sediment would represent an average of multiple discrete depositional events. Furthermore, vertical sampling for isotopic measurements within seemingly homogenous deposits may reveal chemical laminations that cannot be visually resolved (Figure 38.4).

Third, some types of sediments in archaeological sites are heterogeneous in composition. When dealing with samples that contain several types of calcareous materials, the analyst may choose to utilize the microdrilling technique in order to target or avoid certain materials. Examples of these types of deposits include sediment

(a) Multiple discrete layers of calcareous plaster from a building floor (Aşkı Lühyük, Neolithic tell, Turkey). The individual plaster layers (PL) range from  $0.5 - 9\mathrm{mm}$  in thickness. Several layers show strong high-order interference colours in the micromass. The composition of these layers was explored further using micro-FTIR analyses (see Berna 2017, this book), confirming the presence of calcite as a fine fraction component in two of these layers (CalPL), while a third layer did not contain calcite  $(\mathsf{PL}^{*})$ . Additional thin and discontinuous plaster layers are present but not labelled. Using the microdrilling technique, samples of the two thick calcareous plaster layers may be obtained. Furthermore, other types of calcareous materials, such as occupation debris layers (OD) and fill (F) may be avoided. Composite image, XPL.

containing reworked aggregates of ashes (Figure 38.3d), a nodular calcic horizon formed on a colluvial deposit containing older calcite nodules, and lime plaster containing unreacted or partially reacted lime or other inclusions.

Finally, postdepositional alteration can render certain portions of the deposit less desirable for analysis. For example, in some cases the calcareous material of interest may be locally impacted by secondary calcite formation or recrystallization (Figure 38.3e). In cases where these areas are not visible in the field or in hand sample, they may only be avoided using microdrilling. In addition, the analyst may use other types of analyses that provide evidence for alteration prior to isotopic sampling. For example, both cathodoluminescence microscopy and micro-FTIR analyses may be conducted on

# 38.4 Concluding Remarks

At the time of writing, the analysis of stable isotopes in resin-impregnated archaeological sediment samples is in its infancy and a broad range of applications may be imagined but has not yet been realized. In the upcoming years, it is expected that the variety of materials and isotopic systems that can be analysed will increase, as will the power of integration of in situ quantitative geochemical analyses and micromorphology.

# 39.1 Principles of the Analytical Method

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is an instrumental technique used to identify the functional groups (e.g., amide, phosphate, carbonate and hydroxyl) present in organic and inorganic compounds by measuring their absorption of infrared radiation over a range of wavelengths (e.g., 50 to  $5000\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  wavenumber). The method is based on first collecting an interferogram of a sample signal using an interferometer, and then performing a Fourier transform (a mathematical algorithm) on the interferogram to obtain the infrared spectrum. A modern FTIR spectrometer thus collects and digitizes the interferogram, performs the Fourier transform and displays the FTIR spectrum.

The coupling of a FTIR spectrophotometer to an optical microscope produces a system capable of doing FTIR microspectroscopy. This technological achievement has been possible since the early 1980s following the introduction of Fourier transform computer capabilities as well as advances in IR detector technology (Messerschmidt & Harthcock 1988). The success in application of IR microspectrophotometers and FTIR microscopes to many areas of research (semiconductors, polymers, and pharmaceuticals), as well as forensic investigation, has established this technique as a powerful tool in the analysis of small samples (e.g., particles with a diameters less than  $150\mu \mathrm{m}$ ). Researchers in conservation science quickly saw the applications of FTIR microspectroscopy to the analysis of tiny samples from works of art (Derrick et al. 1999). The first published application of IR microspectroscopy was for the analysis of painting materials, done with a dispersive spectrometer by van't Hul Ehrnreich in 1970 (Derrick et al. 1999). Later, the attachment of microscopes to FTIRs stimulated numerous applications for the analysis of paint layers, binding media, varnishes, waxes, dyes, and other

materials (Derrick et al. 1999). Archaeologists followed (Berna & Goldberg 2007; Berna et al. 2012; Prinsloo et al. 2014). To date FTIR spectrometers are fully integrated with optical microscopes into FTIR microscopes (e.g., Thermo-Nicolet Continuum and iN10®, Bruker Hyperion®, Agilent Cary®). Some of these instruments have been connected to synchrotron light sources for the analysis of particles with diameter as small as  $3\mu \mathrm{m}$  (Miller et al. 2003). For more information on the history, design, and operation of IR microspectrophotometers, see Messerschmidt & Harthcock (1988) and Katon et al. (1989-1990).

# 39.2 Sampling and Analytical Procedure

Commercial benchtop FTIR microscopes are built with fully integrated optical and FTIR microscopic capability. This capability is achieved by mounting optical objectives and IR light condensers on the same nosepiece. High-end models are also equipped with polarizers and analysers for transmitted light microscopy. Particles of interest embedded in uncovered petrographic thin sections are centred and focused with the optical microscope objective and then analysed through the FTIR objective (Figure 39.1). Infrared spectra of the particles as small as  $10\mu \mathrm{m}$  can be collected individually or mapped in larger areas with the use of automated stages and dedicated software. Samples can be analysed in transmission, total reflection, and attenuated total reflectance (ATR). The transmission analysis of samples processed in petrographic thin sections is limited to the use of IR spectral bands above  $2400\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ , as the glass slide absorbs the transmitted energy of the IR bands below  $2400\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ . When analysed in reflection (total or attenuated), the particle is shined and the reflected and unreflected (absorbed) radiation is measured. In reflection the sample is shined through the

air while in ATR the sample is placed in contact with specially designed high index crystals (e.g., diamond, germanium, zinc selenide) that direct portion of the IR beam (i.e., the evanescent wave) into the sample. Spectra acquired in reflection (total or attenuated) are subject to light scattering phenomena and thus for best results the surface of the thin section needs to be polished with  $1\mu \mathrm{m}$  grit abrading material. Commercial and custom built spectral library are used for the identification of the functional groups and the corresponding compounds (e.g., spectral libraries available at http://www.thermoscientific.com/, accessed 6 March 2017; Kimmel Center for Archaeological Science: http://www.weizmann.ac.il/kimmel-arch/infrared-spectra-library, accessed 6 March 2017; Simon Fraser University Geoarchaeology Lab).

# 39.3 Archaeological Applications

The application of FTIR analysis to archaeological investigation ranges widely from dating, to use of space, ancient pyrotechnologies, diagenesis and transformation of the archaeological record; all major aspects of site formation processes (Weiner 2010). By FTIR it is in fact possible to identify organic and inorganic compounds of archaeological interest. These include proteins (e.g., collagen, albumin), organic polymers (e.g., cellulose, lignin), fatty acids, resins (e.g., ambers), waxes, silicates (e.g., quartz, feldspars, clay minerals), carbonates (e.g., calcite, aragonite, vaterite, dolomite), phosphates (e.g., hydroxyl

apatite, variscite, taranakite, fluorite), sulphates (e.g., gypsum, anhydrite), and nitrates (e.g., nitratite, saltpetre). Fourier transform infrared microscopy enables the researcher to perform FTIR analysis directly on the thin sections of intact archaeological materials and sediments, thus permitting the integration in real time of micromorphological, petrographic, chemical and mineralogical information (Berna & Goldberg 2007; Berna et al. 2012; Poduska et al. 2012; Simms et al. 2012). Fourier transform infrared microscopy normally provides qualitative information, namely presence or absence of a particular mineral (e.g., aragonite) and/or organic compound (e.g., bone collagen) and their general qualitative state (e.g., degree of crystallinity and/or state of preservation and/or thermal alteration). Quantitative analysis is also possible provided that the system sample thin-section instrument is calibrated with standard materials processed in petrographic thin section.

Fourier transform infrared microscopy applied to soil micromorphology is particularly effective for the study of syn- and postdepositional diagenetic processes. In fact, important authigenic minerals such as calcium, aluminium and iron phosphates (e.g., apatite, variscite, taranakite, montgoryite, crandallite, leucophosphite) that are proxies of specific geochemical conditions of formation can be readily identified in thin sections by FTIR microscopy (Figure 39.2). Specifically, calcium phosphates (e.g., carbonate hydroxyl apatite) form in neutral conditions, aluminium and magnesium phosphates (e.g., montgoryite, taranakite, variscite) form

in slightly acid conditions, while iron phosphates (e.g., leucophosphite and crandallite) form in strong acid conditions (Karkanas et al. 2000; Shahack-Gross et al. 2004). Moreover FTIR microscopy provides molecular information suitable for characterizing the state of preservation of bone, ivory, tooth enamel and charcoal (Goldberg & Berna 2010; Weiner 2010). In turn, this evidence provides information on sediment geochemical conditions and site formation processes. Furthermore, FTIR is suitable to estimating temperature transformations of clay minerals, carbonates, phosphates and sulphates (Berna et al. 2007; Berna 2010; Weiner 2010; Weiner et al. 2015). Thus the coupling of FTIR microscopy to the micromorphological analysis of thin sections of archaeological materials, deposits, and features can be used effectively to identify and reconstruct ancient pyrotechnological activities. For instance at Wonderwerk Cave, South Africa, the integration of micromorphology and FTIR microscopy allowed the identification of mmsize heated bone fragments associated with ashed plant materials on stable surfaces containing in situ early Acheulean stone tools (Berna et al. 2012). In fact, upon reaching temperature of  $450 - 500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  the bone mineral (carbonate hydroxyl apatite) transforms into an higher crystalline phase of carbonate hydroxyl apatite with typical FTIR absorptions at 630 and  $3570\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  (Figure 39.3). Similarly by FTIR microscopy it is possible to estimate

the temperature reached by clay minerals contained in pyrotechnological installations (e.g., furnace walls), discoloured substrata of combustion features and soil particles included in wood ashes. In fact, kaolinite breaks down at temperature of about  $500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  while smectites and micas break down above  $700^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  (Farmer 1974). Considering that by FTIR microscopy it is possible to map the presence/absence of kaolinite and mica/smectite it is possible to locate particles and areas that were heated to temperatures below  $500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , comprised between  $500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and  $700^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and above  $700^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Such analytical approach has been used for the study of Maya fired clay cooking implements from the Yucatan (Simms et al. 2012). This study identified the local origin of the raw material with inclusion of exotic volcanic glass and firing due to repetitive use in oven pits.

Despite the numerous potentials listed, the use of FTIR microscopy on petrographic thin sections has some limitations. For instance FTIR microscopy is not very well suited for the identification of the different kind of feldspars (e.g., plagioclase, k-feldspars), pyroxenes and iron oxides. For the identification and characterization of the latter class of minerals the use of micro Raman, micro-XRD and microprobe are best suited (see Berthold & Mentzer 2017, this book; Wilson 2017, this book). Another major limitation of using FTIR microscopy on petrographic thin section is the presence of epoxy and

polyester resins used conventionally for the preparation of the thin sections that compromises the identification of lipids, waxes and other organic residues. For the studies of these compounds in thin-section staining,

radioactive labelling and immunofluorescence techniques are probably best suited but yet only tested on archaeological materials processed in cross-section (Vagnini et al. 2008; Goldenberg et al. 2014).

# 40.1 Fundamentals of X-ray Diffraction

# 40.1.1 Overview

In 1912, Max von Laue discovered that crystals serve as three-dimensional diffraction gratings for X-rays because the spacing of atoms in crystal lattices is of the same order of magnitude as the wavelength of X-rays (Friedrich et al. 1912). Bragg & Bragg (1913) formulated the so called 'Bragg law', which correlates the spacing of lattice planes in a crystal with the scattering angle of monochromatic X-rays:

$$
n \lambda = 2 d \sin \theta
$$

where  $n$  is the scattering order (a positive integer),  $\lambda$  is the wavelength of the X-rays,  $d$  is the spacing of the crystal planes and  $\theta$  is the angle between the incident beam and the scattering crystal plane (the so called 'Bragg angle').

X-ray diffraction (XRD) relies on two functional principles: (i) the elastic scattering of a monochromatic or polychromatic X-ray beam by the electrons in atoms in a periodic arrangement due to a crystal lattice and (ii) the constructive interference of the scattered X-rays under a certain angle. X-ray diffraction, as an analytical technique is used for studying the crystal structure of inorganic and organic substances. It is primarily suited to characterize crystalline components in materials, and to determine phase compositions of mixed materials. Information on amorphous content can also be obtained.

Due to its individual crystal structure and chemical composition, every crystalline substance yields a unique pattern in an X-ray diffractogram, where intensity of the scattered X-ray beam is plotted versus the diffraction angle.

The typical subject of XRD analysis in geosciences is the determination of the phase or mineral content of an unknown mixture of crystalline phases (minerals) in a rock, soil, ceramic and so forth by analysing powders or solid materials by powder diffraction. In powder diffraction, the scattered beams of the same d-value of lattice planes correspond to one diffraction cone (Debye ring) with a specific opening angle. If the crystallites in the analysed sample volume are statistically orientated in all directions, each diffraction cone will exhibit an even intensity distribution. Textured or too coarse crystallites with bad orientation statistics in the sample result in a nonuniform or spotty intensity distribution of the individual diffraction cones. The integrated diffraction patterns produced from an unknown mineral or mixture of minerals can be analysed and compared using databases, such as the PDF database from the ICDD (International Centre for Diffraction Data) or the COD (Crystallography Open Database). Other open-access databases are available (e.g., Downs 2006) or users may generate their own databases using personal reference materials.

# 40.2 XRD Instrumentation

# 40.2.1 Classical Powder-XRD

In geosciences, the most common application of XRD is in the analysis of powder samples. Several mg of a sample with grain sizes typically between  $1\mu \mathrm{m}$  to  $10\mu \mathrm{m}$  ensure good statistics for representative intensities of the peaks ('reflections'), which are indispensable for further interpretation of the measurement (see section 40.1.1). A typical X-ray powder diffractometer consists of a water-cooled X-ray tube, a detector for recording the intensities of X-rays scattered by the analysed sample,

and a goniometer that controls the angle between the X-ray tube, sample and detector. The sample must be precisely positioned in the goniometer centre (focus) to avoid errors in the measured peak positions. Sample rotation within the goniometer centre also aids in producing representative reflection intensities.

X-ray tubes always emit continuous Bremsstrahlung radiation, superimposed by different characteristic wavelengths depending on the anode material. For the calculation of d-values from peak positions using the Bragg law, however, only one defined wavelength is indispensable. Therefore, filters or primary monochromators are used to suppress the unwanted X-ray wavelengths. Alternatively, a secondary monochromator in front of the detector could be used to suppress both, exited sample fluorescence and the unwanted X-ray wavelengths generated by the X-ray tube. Nowadays, progress in detector technology also provides the opportunity to use energy-dispersive detectors for this purpose.

# 40.2.2 X-Ray Microdiffraction

Powder XRD measurements may be conducted on loose sediment samples collected from the face of an oriented block of archaeological sediment prior to processing for micromorphological analysis. For samples in thin section, or for very small sample amounts, the more appropriate technique is a variety of XRD known as X-ray microdiffraction ( $\mu$ -XRD).  $\mu$ -XRD allows the analyst to measure small sample volumes, perform high-resolution, locally resolved phase mapping of heterogeneous materials and directly measure uneven sample surfaces without sample preparation. Due to these advantages and due to the fact that stand-alone laboratory systems are now available,  $\mu$ -XRD today has applications not only in the field of geosciences but also in fields such as materials sciences and archaeometry.

$\mu$ -XRD differs from the classical XRD setup described above in a few key ways (Figure 40.1b):

- The diameter of the X-ray beam is adjusted using pin-hole collimator systems, X-ray optics (like mono- or polycapillary lenses), or X-ray mirror systems (like Montel optics). Using X-ray optics or X-ray mirrors for beam shaping is preferred over the use of pinhole collimators because the former approaches produce X-ray beam fluxes that are orders of magnitude higher (Berthold et al. 2009).  
- The sample stage component of the system is modified in  $\mu$ -XRD relative to classical XRD in that an optical microscope is used for sample identification and alignment of the target area in the goniometer centre.  
- The sample stage is motorized in three directions in order to facilitate locally resolved measurements and

phase mappings. Automated rotation of the stage about the vertical axes can be used to produce better crystallite statistics (see below).

- In a  $\mu$ -XRD setup, use of a large two-dimensional detector (termed '  $\mu$ -XRD²') is highly recommended because of the small analysed sample area and the consequently bad crystallite statistics in such a small volume. Only two-dimensional detector systems give a direct insight into the diffraction image, as well as the opportunity to evaluate whether the intensity distribution of each observed diffraction cone (Debye ring) is uniformly or spotty (Figure 40.1c), which is the key to avoiding misinterpretation of the measured diffractogram (see also sections 40.1.1 and 40.3).

Furthermore, due to the small X-ray beam diameter, air-cooled, low-power microfocus X-ray tubes can be used, which allows the development of mobile instruments. Further details about the technique of microdiffraction using two-dimensional detectors can be found in He (2011).

In  $\mu$ -XRD, the analytical area is variable and depends on the optics of the instrument and the sampling parameters. The spot size of the primary X-ray beam where it interacts with the sample, and thereby the local resolution, is easily adjustable by changing the X-ray optic or the pinhole diameter on the exit of the collimator/X-ray-mirror system. Depending on the incident angle of the X-ray beam, the spot has the shape of an ellipse with variable long axis length, which is related to the angle of incidence, and a fixed short axis length that is dependent on the spot size of the X-ray optic/collimator (Figure 40.2a). It is also important to note that the spot size varies depending on whether the sample is fixed in place or rotated. If a sample must be rotated to obtain random crystal orientations, the spot size will be a circle with the diameter determined by the length of the long axis of the ellipse.

In contrast to powder-XRD,  $\mu$ -XRD measurements can be performed without any sample preparation even on rough sample surfaces like rock fragments and archaeological artefacts.  $\mu$ -XRD is therefore perfectly suited for nondestructive measurements in an archaeological context. Only near-surface information is detectable, with an analysing depth ranging from smaller than  $1\mu \mathrm{m}$  up to tens of  $\mu \mathrm{m}$  depending on the material, the wavelength of the incident X-rays, the X-ray flux on the sample and the setup of the diffractometer (incident / diffracting angle, detector efficiency, etc.) and on the intensity of the particular reflection.

For micromorphological samples, it is possible to conduct  $\mu$ -XRD measurements directly on uncovered petrographic thin sections. In the event that the thin sections are covered, it is also possible to conduct measurements

The positions and intensities of the observed reflections provide a fingerprint of the structures (minerals) present in the analysed sample. In this case, the whole X-ray diffraction pattern was produced from approximately  $6^{\circ} - 68^{\circ}2\Theta$  by integrating two slightly overlapping detector images, such as the one shown in (c). (b) This is a typical set-up of a  $\mu\text{-XRD}^2$  diffractometer with a  $50\mu \mathrm{m}$  polycapillary X-ray optic and a micromorphological thin section positioned on the instrument stage. The X-ray tube, which is located to the left of the monochromator, is not visible. The large, primary beam stable two-dimensional area detector shown here has a  $14\mathrm{cm}$  window diameter capable of detection over an area of  $2048\times 2048$  pixels and covers in this position angles of approximately  $40^{\circ}2\Theta$  and  $40^{\circ}\psi$ . (c) A typical example of a detector image from the 2D detector covering approximately  $6^{\circ} - 46^{\circ}2\Theta$ . The diffraction ring segments (Debye-rings) are sections of the diffraction cones from the certain lattice planes (see section 40.1.1). The integration of the whole detector image gives the typical diffraction pattern, as shown in (a). The arrow indicates an incomplete ring, which can result from preferred orientation of the crystals within the measured area. Intense single crystal spots are also visible in the middle and at the lower edge of the image (see section 40.1.1).

on the sliced face of a resin-impregnated sediment block, or on the chip used to produce a thin section. In this way, the micromorphologist can best integrate the results with other analyses conducted on the thin sections. Small amounts (down to a few  $\mu \mathrm{g}$ ) of sample material may also be drilled from resin-impregnated sediment, or other types of archaeological artefacts, but the exact context for the results depends strongly on the sampling accuracy. In all cases, when resin or other embedding material is used, for example to impregnate or fix the sample, one must keep in mind that short-range ordering of the embedding material could contribute to the measured diffractogram, resulting in a more or less intense background bump overlapping the sample information (Figure 40.2b).

# 40.3 Output and Analysis

The result of a single classical powder measurement is processed by a computer and summarized in a data table or represented graphically in a type of x-y plot called the 'diffraction pattern' or 'diffractogram' (see Figure 40.1a). In a diffractogram, the units of measure on the  $x$ -axis are the Bragg angle in  $^\circ 2\theta$ , and the  $y$ -axis gives the scattered intensity typically in units of counts per second. Taking into account the wavelength of the X-rays emitted by the tube and the Bragg law, the angle  $2\theta$  can be replaced by the d-spacing in nm on the  $x$ -axis. Scattered X-rays appear on diffractograms as peaks ('reflections') of varying intensity (see also section 40.1.1). It is important to note that this type of plot cannot be referred to as a 'spectrum' because the  $x$ -axis is neither a wavelength nor energy.

The diffraction pattern can be qualitatively analysed to identify the crystal structures present in the sample. Today, software packages with search-match algorithms

are available, which match the angle and intensities of peaks to those produced from references in, for example, the databases listed in section 40.1.1. Problems in identification can arise if many different crystal structures are present in one sample, due to possible overlaps of certain peaks. Furthermore, all computer-generated identifications must be confirmed by the analyst, who may need to consider the context of the sample when choosing the best of several possible matches.

Quantification of phase content within a phase mixture using relative peak intensities is possible using internal or external standard methods or, for example, using Rietveld software packages but it is important to keep in mind that many parameters must be considered for this purpose. The integrated intensities of the scattered X-rays represented on the  $y$ -axis of the diffractogram depend on the structure factor, the multiplicity factor, absorption, extinction, Lorentz and polarization factors, geometric factors and the displacement (temperature) factor. Additionally the intensities of the X-ray data can be influenced by preferred orientations of crystallites, as well as elements of the diffractometer setup. Therefore, it is impossible to quantify amounts of different substances only by comparing the individual peak intensities if the aforementioned factors are unknown. In addition, the detection limit of certain structures depends on these parameters. As a result, the detection limits for different components of a mixture are variable, ranging from below  $1\%$  up to several percent.

In addition to structure identification, the diffraction pattern yields other types of information about the composition of the sample:

- Peak shifts of certain reflections can be caused by substitution of elements in the crystal lattice (e.g., Mg versus Ca in calcite). Other factors that influence peak positions include strain / stress in the analysed sample, which causes changes in the lattice distances.

Phosphatized endocarp of Celtis tournefortii from the Neolithic site of Aşkıli Höyük, Turkey. The white arrow indicates the outer edge of the endocarp at the contact with the surrounding sediment. The black area at the base of the image is a resin-filled void. Photographs taken with the camera of the microdiffractometer (oblique incident light, width of view approximately two mm). (b) Diffraction patterns with both X-ray optics from the fixed areas illustrated in (a). The broad hump (arrow) in the  $20 - 30^{\circ}2\Theta$  region of the diffraction pattern on the left is due mainly to the presence of the embedding resin within the measured area using the  $500\mu \mathrm{m}$  monocapillary X-ray optic with  $300\mu \mathrm{m}$  pinhole. The additional quartz peak (Q) in the left is due to the quartz within the sedimentary matrix sampled within the larger measured area. Theoretical quartz peaks (red) and hydroxyapatite peaks (blue) are illustrated. In the right pattern only the hydroxyapatite information is visible, due to the significantly smaller spot size using the  $50\mu \mathrm{m}$  polycapillary optic. In addition, the background hump is reduced, here caused only by small amounts of resin inside of pores, and possibly interference from the glass (see Baker et al. 2014). (c) Diffraction pattern (left inset) from an area containing two sand grains composed of single crystals of quartz (right inset; width of view approximately two mm) in fixed position. Analyses of single crystals, or multiple crystals with preferred orientation will appear as bright spots or incomplete diffraction rings (see also Figure 40.1b). Integrating diffraction images with these features yields correct peak positions but wrong intensities, compared to the theoretical quartz values (blue). The green arrows indicate the correct height (intensity) of the reflections. In such a case either sample rotation or enlarging the analysed area for better crystallite statistics could be helpful. Sample from Eland's Bay Cave, South Africa.

- Peak broadening can correlate with the mean size of the corresponding coherent scattering domain direction (often misleadingly referred to as the particle or grain size - Scherrer 1918). However, many other effects may also contribute to peak broadening, such as the instrumental setup, strain, chemical heterogeneities, and microstress.  
- Finally, information on a potential amorphous phase or glassy content can also be obtained by carefully checking the angle-dependent background. This process is best accomplished with comparison to a reference measurement.

The output of a  $\mu$ -XRD measurement is similar to that of classical XRD. If a two-dimensional detector is used ( $\mu$ -XRD²), a certain number of overlapping diffraction images (see Figure 40.1c) is produced depending on size of the detector and the  $2\theta$ -range to be analysed. The information from each must be integrated and they must be processed together into a single diffractogram (see Figure 40.1a). The peak positions and relative intensities can then be compared to those of references in databases like the Crystallography Open Database (COD) or the PDF database from the International Centre for Diffraction Data (ICDD). Analysis of a single crystal, or a small number of crystals will produce diffraction images consisting of either a single diffraction spot or a several spots depending on the individual orientation of the crystals (Figure 40.2c, see also section 40.1.1 and examples in Lange et al. 2010; Berthold et al. 2015; Bramble et al. 2015). The integration of such images will result in misleading intensities and hamper correct phase identification. The solution to this problem is either sample rotation about a vertical axis or enlargement of the analysed area, which will increase the number of individual crystal orientations and produce a more suitable diffractogram. In this way, both single crystals and polycrystalline aggregates may be analysed. The diffractogram will contain peaks associated with all mineral species in the analysed area (see Figure 40.2b). If multiple minerals are present, it will be necessary to identify each of these individually. Petrographic observations can be helpful for deciding whether multiple minerals are present, some of which may be identified using optical properties and their peaks eliminated from the resulting diffractogram (Figure 40.3). It may be necessary to conduct supplementary analyses, using  $\mu$ -XRF, microprobe, or SEM-EDAX and use the elemental composition to produce a list of potential mineral species (see Figure 40.3b and c). In the event that the peaks from the unknown mineral do not match any patterns in the digital databases it is also possible to compare the diffraction pattern to those in printed publications, including volumes of published standards (e.g., Swanson et al.

1953) or articles focused on the description of crystal structures of single mineral species.

Other types of complementary and supplemental analyses may be necessary to confirm phase identifications. Amorphous or poorly crystalline materials and organic compounds are difficult to analyse using both classical XRD and  $\mu$ -XRD. In micromorphological samples, amorphous materials include glass, opaline phytoliths, short range order clay minerals, such as allophanes, and plant and animal tissues. For these materials, molecular (vibrational) spectrometry conducted at high resolution, such as  $\mu$ -Fourier transform infrared ( $\mu$ -FTIR) spectroscopy (see Berna 2017, this volume) or  $\mu$ -Raman spectroscopy, can be employed. In a typical workflow for archaeological micromorphology, these types of microanalyses may be used sequentially to identify an unknown mineral. Many studies in soil science and geosciences more broadly incorporate a suite of complementary microanalytical tools, starting with optical petrography and utilizing  $\mu$ -XRD (e.g., Manceau et al. 2005; Soubrand-Colin et al. 2005; Singer et al. 2009; Lange et al. 2010; Corriveau et al. 2011; Izawa et al. 2011, 2012; Baker et al. 2014). For micromorphology, the choice of microanalytical methods and their order of application depends on the research question, timeline and budget. In the examples illustrated in Figures 40.3 and 40.4, initial  $\mu$ -FTIR measurements failed to yield mineral identifications. Compared to molecular spectroscopic techniques, which provide information about molecular bonds and symmetry of molecules in a material either crystalline or amorphous, XRD analyses provide information about the spacing of the lattice planes in a crystalline structure (mineral). Although  $\mu$ -XRD analyses may be more expensive, advantages of the approach include widely available databases of diffraction patterns that contain thousands of references. Furthermore, all crystalline substances (minerals) produce diffraction patterns.  $\mu$ -XRD measurements can therefore provide an important information when other techniques have previously failed.

# 40.4.1 Mineral Identification

As described above,  $\mu$ -XRD is commonly used to identify individual minerals, mixtures of minerals, or other crystalline compounds when other optical or molecular analyses have failed. Analyses may be conducted as single point measurements, or multiple measurements along line transects or over grids. In micromorphological samples, mineral identification using  $\mu$ -XRD

Petrographic analyses indicate that the mineral has a radial crystal habit and exhibits first-order grey to orange interference colours. Elands Bay Cave, South Africa. XPL. (b) SEM-EDS mapping performed on a carbon-coated, uncovered thin section indicate that the mineral is rich in phosphorus (red colour) relative to the surrounding clay and quartz. (c) SEM-EDS mapping also shows that the clay and the diagenetic mineral contain more aluminium (white colour) than the quartz. (d) The diffraction pattern resulting from  $\mu$ -XRD analysis ( $50\mu m$  polycapillary X-ray optic) of the altered area clearly indicates the presence of two phases: variscite (red lines;  $\mathrm{Al}(\mathrm{PO}_4)\cdot 2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$ ) and quartz (blue lines, Q). Measurement time for the whole diffractogram was  $4\mathrm{min}$ . Quartz peaks were excluded from the database search, which was optimized with knowledge of the major elements.

may be necessary under a variety of circumstances. Several applications of mineral identification are illustrated in Figures 40.3, 40.4 and 40.5 and described in detail below.

Small crystal or particle size can limit the ability of the analyst to observe optical properties using a standard petrographic microscope. This is the case in micromor

phology when studying components of the silt and clay fraction, or microcrystalline secondary mineral phases. For example, secondary phosphate and sulfate minerals may form in archaeological deposits as microcrystalline nodules and masses (Figure 40.5). Under these conditions, it can be difficult to observe crystal habits, which may be the only features that could allow distinction

(b) The same bone as in (a) viewed using the instrument camera (width of view approximately 2 mm). The red dot indicates the position of a measurement taken without rotation. (c) Detail of the boundary between the altered and unaltered portions of the bone. The diagenetic mineral phase is evidenced by the increase in interference colour order under XPL and visible spherulitic microcrystals. (d) Micro-FTIR analysis of the altered area conducted prior to micro-XRD analysis revealed the presence of a carbonate mineral (peaks positions labelled) in addition to hydroxyapatite but the exact identification was uncertain. The remaining peaks are indicative of hydroxyapatite and resin. (e) The diffraction pattern contains peaks indicative of one expected phase (hydroxyapatite; blue) and the unknown phase (green), identified as kutnohorite  $(\mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}, \mathrm{Mg}, \mathrm{Fe}^{2+})(\mathrm{CO}_3)_2)$ . Further research revealed that the IR peaks illustrated in (d) match those of a kutnohorite reference (Chukanov 2014). The sharpness of the hydroxyapatite diffraction peaks suggests high crystallinity. This observation is consistent with a micro-FTIR spectrum collected from the lower half of the bone fragment, which contains the phosphate high temperature peak (arrow in (d) – see also Thompson et al. 2011), indicative of burning.

Figure 40.5 Applications of micro-XRD in the identification of mineral nodules and crusts. (a) A mineral crust formed on a fragment of quartzite cannot be readily identified using its optical properties due to small crystal size. Eland's Bay Cave, South Africa. PPL. (b) The mineral exhibits low order grey interference colours. XPL. (c) Autofluorescence under blue light PPL suggests that this mineral is phosphatic. (d) Other examples of this mineral in the same sample include nodules that have formed inside fragments of charcoal, a process that micromorphological analyses reveal has contributed to its mechanical breakdown and low recovery of the material during excavation. (e) The diffraction pattern perfectly matches to the mineral taranakite, specifically the potassium-rich phase  $(\mathrm{K}_3\mathrm{Al}_5(\mathrm{PO}_3\mathrm{OH})_6(\mathrm{PO}_4)_2.18\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O})$ . Slight differences in the observed intensities are due to coarse crystallite spots.

between two or more similar phases. Microcrystalline calcite and aragonite are also difficult to distinguish due to their similar interference colours. Positive identification of these phases can be useful for understanding the thermal or diagenetic histories of archaeological materials, such as shell. Clay minerals and clay-sized particles in the fine fraction of a deposit have crystal sizes that preclude use of optical properties for identification. Loose sediment samples could be prepared in such a way as to provide (001)-textured samples necessary for a clay mineral identification using classical powder XRD (e.g., Moore & Reynolds 1989). However, in archaeological and soil samples, information about the spatial distribution of clay minerals is lost in such bulk analyses. Using  $\mu\text{-XRD}^2$  for identification of clay minerals in micromorphological thin sections can provide information about sediment source (when present in the groundmass), pedogenic processes (when present in argillic pedofeatures), mineral weathering (see Soubrand-Colin et al. 2005), and human activities (when present in materials such as ceramics). In this case, it should be noted that the results of the analyses will be similar to those produced from powder analysis of an unprepared bulk sample (Izawa et al. 2012).

Furthermore, other factors may limit the ability of the analyst to use optical properties and crystal habits to identify minerals. Staining by secondary iron and manganese oxides or humic acids can mask optical properties of minerals and materials in thin sections. In the case of diagenesis, crystal habits may be misleading when a secondary phase is pseudomorphic after a primary phase. For example, gypsum crystals, which exhibit a characteristic lozenge form, are readily replaced by anhydrite, basanite, and calcite (Karkanas 2010, Figures 1-3; Mees & Tursina 2010; Poch et al. 2010, Figure 11). Another example of mineral replacement is provided in Figure 40.2a, where microcrystalline hydroxyapatite has replaced the primary aragonite in the seed endocarp of Celtis tournefortii without altering the morphology of the biogenic material. Finally, the optical properties of rare mineral phases may be unknown to the analyst, poorly described in the literature, or atypical of the mineral owing to the particular archaeological burial conditions (see Figure 40.4).

The successful identification of unknown mineral phases is therefore important for many different types of studies. In addition to the examples above, it is possible to reconstruct chemical conditions within archaeological deposits by documenting the presence or absence of certain diagenetic mineral phases (see Figures 40.3 and 40.4). These mineral phases can be used to understand past moisture and pH within the deposits (Karkanas et al. 2000; Karkanas 2010). Combined with observations about the spatial relationship of secondary minerals with

other materials in thin section (Goldberg & Berna 2010), it can be possible to understand the impacts of diagenesis on the preservation of archaeological materials (see Figures 40.4 and 40.5). For similar applications of  $\mu$ -XRD for the analysis of soils and mineral weathering, see Soubrand-Colin et al. (2005) and Baker et al. (2014). In addition, mineral identification can used to characterize anthropogenic materials in terms of source or production history. For example, mineral phases and their relative abundances can be used to identify sources of ochres and other pigments. Blasco-Lopez et al. (2015) strongly recommend the use of  $\mu$ -XRD as one step in the study of plasters, which are often present in thin layers that are difficult to sample as loose sediments. In the study of plasters, mortars and cements, the identification of hydraulic phases (Callebaut et al. 2001) and other inclusions can be informative about production history and ancient pyrotechnology (Karkanas 2007). Finally,  $\mu$ -XRD² has proven useful for nondestructively studying the mineral content of ceramic archaeological artefacts and pigments (Berthold et al. 2015, 2016), lithic tools (Drechsler et al. 2013), metal objects, crystallites in glasses or glazes (Gradmann et al. 2015) and adornments such as jewellery. In these materials, the identification of minerals combined with chemical analysis can provide information – for example, about sources for raw materials, manufacturing processes, utilization, and trade.

# 40.4.2 Additional Types of Information Provided by  $\mu$ -XRD

Analyses conducted using  $\mu\text{-XRD}^2$ , which employs a large two-dimensional detector (see Figure 40.1b) can yield additional information from micromorphological samples beyond mineral content. This approach can be used to determine the orientation of crystals in thin section. The detector image gives a direct insight into the intensity distribution not only along the  $2\Theta$ -range but also the  $\psi$ -range, which allows the analyst to document local texture and perform orientation analysis (Figure 40.1c, also Bramble et al. 2015). In geological samples, this type of analysis has proven effective for isolating the diffraction patterns pertaining to the clay fraction from those caused by coarser mineral inclusions (Lange et al. 2010). In micromorphological samples, similar analysis could be employed in the study of b-fabric in the groundmass, or pedofeatures, such as clay coatings.

$\mu \text{-XRD}^2$  can also provide information about crystallinity of materials within the analysed area. Coarse crystallites appear as more or less intense single crystal spots in the detector image (see Figures 40.1c and 40.2c). Measurements conducted using a large two-dimensional detector provide a fast and efficient means to differentiate between coarse and fine crystalline phases.

Furthermore, using automated movements of the sample stage, it is possible to map the spatial distribution of different crystallite sizes. Crystallinity may also be measured in a relative sense using aspects of the diffractogram, such as peak broadening (Puceat et al. 2004). These types of crystallinity measurements conducted on materials in thin section may be used for a variety of purposes. For example, geogenic and biogenic apatites can have similar optical properties; however, the latter typically have lower crystallinity. The variations in crystallinity of apatite in bone have also been linked to human modification, such as burning (see Figure 40.3d), as well as postdepositional diagenesis. Therefore crystallinity measurements of apatite in thin section can be informative about taphonomic processes in archaeological sites (Berna et al. 2004).

Unfortunately, some types of measurements applicable to archaeological questions (e.g., Weymouth & Mandeville 1975; Schmidt et al. 2012; Xu et al. 2015) cannot be conducted using this approach. These include quantitative calculations of crystal size and lattice stress and strain, which require homogeneous samples of statistically orientated crystallites distributed over a larger sample volume/area. This precondition is typically in contradiction to the parameters of  $\mu$ -XRD measurements and depends strongly on the crystallite size in relation to the analysed area. To overcome this restriction, one could analyse a larger sample area, or analyse powder obtained from a micromorphological sample by microdrilling.

# 40.5 Concluding Remarks

$\mu$ -XRD<sup>2</sup> is a very promising supplemental analytical approach to the study and identification of materials in thin section. The technique has several advantages over classical powder XRD, including rapid measurement times of seconds to minutes, minimal sample preparation and the ability to conduct measurements in very small areas. The latter two points are especially important for micromorphological samples, wherein small areas can be analysed with no modification to the thin section. Advances in instrumentation over the past decade have reduced spot sizes, and eliminated the need for external radiation sources like synchrotron radiation. Furthermore, large two-dimensional detectors are increasingly affordable, which is indispensable for locally resolved analysis of micromorphological samples. These technical developments will have the effect of making  $\mu$ -XRD<sup>2</sup> measurements more common in the future. The examples provided in this chapter illustrate several ways in which measurements conducted on thin sections may be used in combination with more traditional petrographic observations for studying postdepositional changes to archaeological materials, and mineral formation in archaeological sediments, including successful identification of mineral phases when other approaches have failed.  $\mu$ -XRD<sup>2</sup> is therefore a powerful tool to be used in conjunction with other types of microanalyses.

# 41.1 Principles of the Analytical Method

X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) is a spectral analytical method that measures the relative intensity and energy of characteristic radiation emitted by a substance exposed to X-rays. The method generates information about the elemental composition of a sample, with detectability and precision dependent on the mass number of the element and the instrument configuration. It is a common technique in the geosciences and archaeology, due in part to its wide availability, minimal sample preparation and low cost (Mantler & Schreiner 2000; Shackley 2011). Portable instruments have recently gained popularity in archaeological and museum settings, although there is debate over their reliability (Frahm & Doonan 2013; Shackley 2010). Analyses may be quantitative or semiquantitative, depending on the sample-preparation procedures and instrument calibration.

A typical XRF instrument consists of a source of X-rays, an area where the X-rays interact with a sample, a radiation detector, and processing equipment. The X-ray source generates a beam with high energies that can vary from  $20 - 60\mathrm{kV}$ , while instrument optics direct the beam onto the sample surface – typically a pressed powder but occasionally an intact material – under vacuum. The X-rays interact with atoms present within the sample, removing their inner electrons. When electrons from the outer shells of the affected atoms fill the empty spaces, secondary X-ray photons are emitted, a process referred to as X-ray fluorescence. Some of the photons produced during this process reach the detector. The spectrum produced following processing consists of photon energy on the  $x$ -axis (in keV), and counts on the  $y$ -axis. The peak energies of the ejected photons correspond to the difference in binding energies of electrons between the outer and inner shells. Elements

with higher atomic numbers have a greater number of electrons occupying a greater number of shells and thus the potential for multiple characteristic photon energies is greater. Furthermore, light elements (typically atomic number  $< 12$ ; Mg) have low secondary X-ray photon yields and cannot be reliably detected. The relative peak surface areas correlate to elemental abundance. Data are typically presented as counts per energy interval, which can then be converted into weight percentage oxides or other measures of concentration by means of comparison to standards.

X-ray fluorescence instruments vary in their sources and detector configurations, with some instruments using gamma rays or synchrotron radiation to interact with the sample. All produce data in the form of counts per energy interval, which are represented graphically as spectra. Typical analyses are conducted on pressed powders, which necessitates destruction of the sample. The analysis does not further destroy the powder, which can be potentially returned to an archaeological collection or archive, or subjected to additional analyses. Detailed information about XRF instrument function and sample preparation can be found in any number of popular introductory texts including Beckhoff et al. (2007), Cesareo (2010) and Van Grieken & Markowicz (2001).

Microscopic X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (micro-XRF or  $\mu$ -XRF) is a technique that limits the spatial area over which the X-ray beam interacts with the sample. Laboratory-grade micro-XRF instruments differ from traditional XRF instruments in their X-ray focusing optics and sample chamber configurations. For the former, the use of mono- and polycapillary lenses enable the generation of a spot size that is of the order of several micrometers in diameter. This microscopic spot size, in combination with a motorized sample stage and two-dimensional mapping system, allows for elemental compositions to be measured and reported across areas as

single points, transects and maps. Micro-XRF analyses may also be conducted in specialized facilities using synchrotron radiation sources  $(\mu$  -SRXRF). These types of analyses are not considered here.

For micromorphologists the most important factors to consider when developing an analytical strategy are spot size, sampling volume and detection limits (Behrends & Kleingeld 2009). The spot size is determined primarily by the choice of X-ray tube and focusing optics, which limit the beam diameter to anywhere between 300 and  $25\mu \mathrm{m}$ . The sampling volume is determined by overall volume within which the beam interacts with the sample (a function of spot size and beam intensity) but, more importantly, the depth from which photons can escape. This "information depth" varies for every element and is determined, in part, by the generated photon energies and by the electron density of the sample. In general, the information depth is shallower for lighter elements compared to heavier elements. Conversely, the detection limits for elements vary according to fluorescence yield, which is highest for heavier elements. Detection of specific elements may be improved by adjusting beam intensity, or by using filters.

X-rays are also a byproduct of exposure of a sample to electrons. Thus, scanning electron microscopes (SEM) may be used to produce similar types of measurements, as applied in SEM-EDS analysis (Energy-Dispersive Spectroscopy) and in Electron Microprobe Analysis (EMPA, using a wavelength-dispersive detector system - see Newbury et al. 2003). For the purposes of this entry, it is important to note that all three types of analyses can be conducted in conjunction with a micromorphological study. Bulk analyses may be conducted on powders prepared from loose sediment samples collected from micromorphological blocks prior to resin impregnation. Scanning electron microscopes and EMPA have been used to conduct measurements on micromorphological samples, including thin sections (for more information and examples see Wilson 2017, this book); however, when using these instruments sample preparation methods, sample chamber size, depth of beam penetration, and scan times are different compared to micro-XRF spectroscopy. In general, micro-XRF analyses require less sample preparation than SEM-EDXRA, and micro-XRF instrument sample chambers can be large enough to accommodate museum specimens, which makes them well suited to analyze portions of micromorphological blocks.

Since the 1980s, studies that use micro-XRF analyses for applications in geosciences have grown in popularity and scope (e.g., Boehme 1987; Haschke 2014, pp. 270-283; Jones 2000), although at the time of writing, the most prolific and successful applications are in the field of drill core analysis, which utilizes specialized core scanning instruments (see Croudace & Rothwell 2015).

Researchers in this field emphasize in particular the strength of combining petrography with micro-XRF data (Shanahan et al. 2008a, b; Dulski et al. 2015; Neugebauer et al. 2015), an approach that has direct implications for archaeological micromorphology. Micro-XRF analyses have been conducted successfully directly on resin-impregnated archaeological sediment blocks (Mentzer & Quade 2013). These types of analyses may therefore, with careful sample preparation (Figure 41.1), be conducted within several millimeters of the features observed on petrographic thin sections. Moreover, the results may be presented at resolutions that are comparable to those of observations made using a petrographic microscope.

# 41.2 Sampling and Analytical Procedure

# 41.2.1 Sample Preparation

Table 41.1 presents several sampling options for micromorphological samples. For micro-XRF spectroscopy paired with micromorphology, the measurements are typically conducted on resin-impregnated sediment blocks that have been sliced with a rock or tile saw to obtain a flat surface. For the very best correlation with the micromorphological observations, measurements should be conducted prior to thin section production on the sliced chips of resin-impregnated sediment. Measurements may also be conducted after micromorphological analysis using the remaining portions of the chips that were used to produce the petrographic thin sections (see Figure 41.1c). In this case, the micro-XRF measurements will correspond to areas located within  $1 - 2\mathrm{cm}$  of the sediment visible in thin section. It is also possible to analyze other portions of the resin-impregnated block, including the corresponding plane, provided that the area of interest fits within the sample chamber. Sample chambers vary in size, with typical stage dimensions greater than  $15\times 15\mathrm{cm}$  with sufficient vertical space between the stage and the detector to accommodate resin-impregnated sample chips, slab from blocks, or large blocks sliced in half.

Although it is possible, it is not always recommended to conduct measurements directly on the thin sections, due to the fact that, depending on the beam energy and tube voltage, the X-ray beam may penetrate deeper than 30 microns into the sample. If a thin section of standard thickness  $(30\mu \mathrm{m})$  were analyzed, a portion of the signal could come from the carrier glass. As described above, the information depth for secondary X-ray photons depends on the density of the sample, and the energy of the X-ray line measured (for more information, see Haschke 2014; Fernandez 2000; Janssens 2000).

Under certain circumstances, one can limit the information depth to  $30~\mu \mathrm{m}$  and obtain data for lighter elements from thin sections of standard thickness. Successful analyses of geological samples prepared as standard petrographic thin sections have been reported by Genna et al. (2011) following laboratory tests comparing the effects of sample preparation on the specific materials of interest. To avoid such extensive testing, which may not apply to heterogeneous archaeological samples, it may be preferable to conduct analyses on "thick" sections (including mounted sample slices prior to final grinding), or sections ground to  $50 - 100\mu \mathrm{m}$ . For examples of these approaches, see papers by Cuyen et al. (2010), Attaelmanan (2014) and Angelici et al. (2015). Using these strategies, measurement areas can be located within a few tens of micrometers from the sediment visible on the final thin sections (see Table 41.1).

Micro-XRF analyses are nondestructive to the micromorphological sample; however, large sample blocks or archive slabs may require additional cutting in order to fit the dimensions of the sample chamber. Aside from cleaning to remove dust and slicing debris, there are no additional treatments of the sample surface prior to analysis. Polishing is not necessary. Furthermore, vacuum conditions do not affect the sample negatively in any way.

# 41.2.2 Instrumentation and Configuration

Micro-XRF instruments are typically housed in a laboratory that has been secured, with access limited due to radiation safety precautions. The analyses are not dangerous to the user; however, radiation certification or supervision may be required. The tabletop instruments are attached to desktop computers that allow the analyst to specify the measurement parameters and process the results. Following sample selection and preparation, the sample is placed into the sample chamber of the

instrument and leveled to obtain a horizontal surface. Air may be removed from the sample chamber using a vacuum pump. The sample can then be photographed using the internal camera (see Figure 41.1b and c) and measurement points, transects or areas selected with the computer. Spot size, point averaging parameters, tube voltage (kV), X-ray beam current  $(\mu \mathrm{A})$ , vacuum conditions, and measurement time can be controlled by the user via the computer software. Combined, these factors determine the sample area, the elements that can be measured and the precision of the measurements.

Additional instrument configurations include exchangeable X-ray tubes, and filters. Individual point measurements can take as little as a few seconds for major elements. Longer dwell times are used to detect trace elements. Transects or maps covering large areas can take hours to produce, depending on the spacing of the points (step size) and the dwell time at each point. Decreasing the step size and increasing the dwell time increases the resolution of the resulting image but increases the overall time required for analysis.

When selecting sampling areas and data collection parameters, it is important to consider the limitations of the method. The most significant limitation is that, as mentioned previously, only elements with mass numbers above 11 or  $12\mathrm{(Na}$  and  $\mathrm{Mg})$  can be measured. As a result, micro-XRF spectroscopy will be ineffective for studying organic compounds in micromorphological samples, as carbon is not detectable. Furthermore, elements present in trace amounts will be undetectable or measured with lower precision. Another limitation is that the results for a single point are the composition of the target area on the surface, as well as a volume at depth. Thus, the analytical area can range from hundreds to thousands of cubic microns, depending on spot size. Within this area, there may be voids filled with resin, or heterogeneous sediment. As resin has its own specific chemical composition that can vary between batches or even within the

sample (due to leaching of soluble salts; e.g., NaCl – see Mentzer & Quade 2013), it is important to consider that a portion of the signal could be due to the presence of elements within the resin. In some situations, this "limitation" may be exploited in order to study void abundance and distribution. Issues of low elemental abundance and sampling volume may be addressed by adjusting instrument settings. In some cases, it may be advisable to devise a series of exploratory analyses followed by repeated measurements to ensure that the data are suitable to address the research aims. Finally, the analyst should consider of the size of the analytical area when interpreting results, and focus on general trends over areas rather than individual measurements. Interpretation of single points should be made with caution.

# 41.2.3 Results

The output of a mapping analysis (see Figure 41.1f and g) is a series of images that, in micromorphology, are best suited for direct comparison with petrographic observations. The images can be processed further to improve the spatial resolution. For point measurements collected singly or along transects, the output is in the form of a counts per energy interval, represented as a spectrum (see Figure 41.1d) and a data table listing the total counts for each element, as well as the measurement parameters. The counts are converted to elemental abundances using the instrument software. Elemental abundances measured using micro-XRF spectroscopy should be considered to be semiquantitative, unless further calibrations are applied (Adderley et al. 2007). For example, comparisons between bulk analysis using powder XRF spectroscopy and surface analysis using  $\mu$ -XRF spectroscopy on the same samples indicate that the results are generally correlative, but not identical (Genna et al. 2011). Furthermore, quantitative analyses require homogeneity of the sample within the interaction volume, which, as described above, can be much larger and irregular in shape compared to the spot diameter on the sample surface (see Janssens et al. 2000b). Homogeneity is not a characteristic of most micromorphological samples. The total counts may be converted to atomic percentage, or percentage oxides using models; however, it is important to note that percentage oxide calculations will always add to  $100\%$ . These results may be misleading when a significant portion of the sample is composed of elements that are not detectable using this technique (e.g., elements with mass number  $< 12$ ), or if single elements are present in multiple oxidation states (e.g.,  $\mathrm{Fe_2O_3}$  versus  $\mathrm{FeO}$ ). It is up to the analyst to decide whether data conversions are appropriate for addressing his or her research question.

The semiquantitative results can be used in several different ways. Figure 41.2 illustrates the pairing of micromorphological observations with spectra collected along a vertical transect. In this case, collecting data along a vertical transect allows the analyst to observe stratigraphic trends within a single micromorphological sample, or even spanning multiple samples. The transect spans several microfacies units comprised of layers of construction debris and dung. The units are distinctive in terms of the variance in abundance of Si and Ca, which can be correlated to the presence of materials such as plaster and phytoliths. This example shows that interpretation of the results is best accomplished using an integrated approach in which petrographic observations of the sediment in thin are compared to the elemental data, sometimes in combination with data from other microanalyses.

Statistical analyses may also be conducted using elemental data obtained from micro-XRF analyses. For example, simple plots can be used to observe positive and negative correlations in elemental abundance and test their strength of association (see Strawn et al. 2002; Mentzer & Quade 2013; Winkel et al. 2013). Cluster analysis (Figure 41.3) may be used to compare groupings of different types of sediment based on chemistry to those produced using micromorphological observations (i.e. microfacies types), which may be informative about the genetic relationships between different microstratigraphic units or sources of sediment. In the example provided, cluster analysis supports the observation that red sedimentary aggregates found in archaeological features are similar to those forming within recent geogenic deposits in the same cave. Alternatively, micromorphological observations may be used to define groups in advance and statistical analyses such as principle components analysis can be used to understand their similarities and differences.

# 41.3 Archaeological Applications

Micro-XRF applications in terrestrial sedimentology, soil science and archaeology that link elemental measurements with micromorphological or other petrographic analyses are thus far rather limited. A brief overview of the few studies outside of archaeology reveals several applications in understanding soil forming processes. For example, Manceau et al. (2004) and Voegelin et al. (2007) applied the method to understand the relationship of elements to pedofeatures, such as root channels, which were identified using micromorphology. Strawn et al. (2002) and Thorne et al. (2009) used paired micromorphology and micro-XRF analyses to document mineral and rock weathering processes in acid sulfate and lateritic soils.

Figure 41.2 Production and use of elemental intensity measurements along vertical transects. (a) As part of a broader study on dung inputs to archaeological deposits (see Stiner et al. 2014), a block of sediment was collected and processed into two petrographic thin sections. Under XPL, broad variations in the intensity of interference colors are apparent, and the laminated fabric of the dung is distinctive.  $\mu$ -XRF analyses were conducted along two different vertical transects on the cut block face. Each spectrum is the average of nine points distributed within a  $100\mu \mathrm{m}$  square, each having a  $\sim 40\mu \mathrm{m}$  spot size. Plots of the results illustrate vertical trends in the distribution of elements. Measured from the top of the transect, calcium intensities are lowest from  $0 - 4\mathrm{cm}$ , becoming highly variable from  $4 - 5.5\mathrm{cm}$ . From  $5.5 - 8.5\mathrm{cm}$ , calcium intensities are highest, with low intensities from  $8.5 - 14\mathrm{cm}$  depth. Silicon intensities are most variable in the uppermost  $9\mathrm{cm}$  of the transect, with the lower portion exhibiting high values with low variance. (b) Integration with observations from the thin sections: three photomicrographs correspond to three localities labeled in (a). Figure 41(b)1, from the region of variable Ca intensity, contains gravel- and sand-sized aggregates of carbonate-rich construction material (ca) with elongate vegetal voids derived from the decay of plant fragments used as temper (arrow). XPL. The coarse matrix contains abundant sand-sized fragments of volcanic glass (vg) and feldspar (f), which explains the high variability in Si intensities. Figure 41(b)2 corresponds to the region of highest Ca intensity due to abundant calcareous dung spherulites, with inclusions of calcium oxalates (ox). XPL. Figure 41(b)3 is dung rich in phytoliths (ph) and corresponds to the region of high and invariable Si intensity, PPL.

Figure 41.3 Elemental measurements on different sedimentary components and statistical analyses of the results. (a) Thin section from an Upper Paleolithic anthropogenic deposit (Layer H), incident light scan. The sample contains a layer with abundant rounded red sediment aggregates in a matrix of loose calcareous ashes overlain by an intact ashy combustion feature. (b) The corresponding chip in the  $\mu$ -XRF sample chamber. Point measurements were conducted on 12 red sediment aggregates. Additional measurements were conducted along a vertical transect (red line). (c) The upper combustion feature contains dense ashes with well-preserved rhombic morphologies. PPL. (d) The corresponding spectra show high amounts of Ca, with minor amounts of P. This composition is consistent with ashes. (e) Red sedimentary aggregates in a nonanthropogenic layer (Layer A1, a recent deposit in the same cave that is stratigraphically higher than Layer H) are composed of red clay with silt-sized quartz. Aggregate development is due to intensive bioturbation. PPL. (f) Analysis under oblique incident light (OIL) reveals the presence of possible Mn- and Fe-oxide inclusions. (g) The red aggregates from Layer H that are present in the ashy matrix in the thin section pictured in (a) are similar in morphology and composition to the aggregates that are present within the nonanthropogenic deposit in Layer A1. PPL. (h) Same view as (g), OIL. (i) Cluster analysis conducted on a database containing measurements on 157 individual red sediment aggregates from all of the layers in the site (I through A1) was used as a preliminary test of the hypothesis that the red sediment aggregates in Layer H are similar to those observed forming today in Layer A1. Two clusters are distinguished primarily by the intensity of Fe, Ti, Ca and P. The graph shows the contribution of each element to the calculation of the clusters. Higher values along the x-axis correlate with higher importance in the calculation of the clusters. For comparison, layer membership ranks low on the scale of importance, although layer groupings were not used in the generation of the clusters. (j) A stacked histogram that illustrates the total number of red sediment aggregates belonging to each cluster, grouped by stratigraphic layer (x-axis). The aggregates from Layer A1, pictured in (e) and (f), and the aggregates from Layer H, pictured in (g) and (h), belong to Cluster 1. These, and other statistical analyses support the idea that the red sediment aggregates in Layer H are derived from within the cave. Future analyses will prioritize expanding the sample size.

In a related field, Winkel et al. (2013) compared the results of elemental mapping to petrography of travertine samples in order to understand the relationship between crystal growth and trace elements. Published archaeological applications are exceptionally rare; however, Mentzer and Quade (2013) tested the method on plaster floors from a Neolithic tell and identified correlations between the elemental compositions of calcareous plasters and the carbonate source used to construct them. Adderley et al. (2007) also applied the method to thin sections of archaeological floors, with the goal of understanding chemical effects of the burial environment on bone. Furthermore, Figures 41.2 and 41.3 illustrate additional archaeological applications of micro-XRF.

Due to the similarity of the results, other potential archaeological applications can also be drawn from previous studies integrating micromorphology with SEM or EMPA. These applications include mapping of the distribution of Ca in burned features as a proxy for ash (Courty et al. 1989), documenting the elemental and mineralogical composition of a stabling floor crust (Macphail et al. 2004), understanding the relationship between phosphorus and other pedogenic features in Anthrosols (Schaefer et al. 2004) and identification of authigenic minerals (Karkanas 2010; Karkanas et al. 1999). Other possible applications in archaeological micromorphology range from mineral identification to characterization of sedimentary features.

# 41.4 Concluding Remarks

Micro-XRF shows much promise for studies that integrate micromorphological observations from thin sections with data regarding elemental composition of different sediments and materials. The strengths of the technique include minimal sample preparation, and its suitability for analysis of different portions of micromorphology blocks including large slabs. When carefully selected, analytical areas can be matched directly with sediment observed in thin section. The micromorphological observations therefore provide spatial context for the elemental measurements.

# 42.1 Principles of the Analytical Method

X-ray micro-computed tomography (hereafter micro-CT) is a nondestructive technique that can be used to inspect the internal composition and structure of a wide range of materials, including soil samples. Over the years it has become an indispensable tool in the field of earth sciences (Ketcham & Carlson 2001; Taina et al. 2008; Helliwell et al. 2013; Cnudde & Boon 2013) and is increasingly popular in the field of archaeology for the study of organic and nonorganic artefacts (Bertrand et al. 2012; Tuniz et al. 2013; Tuniz & Zanini 2014). Micro-CT scanning has also been combined with soil micromorphology in earth science (Elliot & Heck 2007; Killfeather & van de Meer 2008; Tania et al. 2010; Tarplee et al. 2011; Elyeznasni et al. 2012; Bendle et al. 2015) and in a few cases, in archaeological science (Adderley et al. 2001; Huisman et al. 2014; Ngan-Tillard et al. 2016). The review presented here is intentionally limited to these latter publications. Studies performed in a nonarchaeological context should be consulted to get further insight into the more general potential of the technique.

In lab-based micro-CT scanners, a source of polychromatic X-rays illuminates the studied object, whilst a detector records the X-ray transmitted through the object. The object is rotated stepwise and at each step, a series of 2D radiographs is recorded. The scanning parameters (voltage and current of the X-ray beam, exposure time, number of radiographs per step and step angle) are selected to reach best compromise between spatial resolution, density contrast resolution and scan acquisition time (Sleutel et al. 2008; Tarplee et al. 2011). The radiographs are then processed with the help of sophisticated algorithms (Vlassenbroeck et al. 2007) to derive patterns of variations in attenuation for 2D slices perpendicular to the axis of rotation that is used during

radiograph acquisition. The reconstructed 2D slices have a finite thickness and consist of elementary building blocks called voxels. Each voxel has a specific grey value. The grey value is a measure of the linear X-ray attenuation coefficient of the materials present in that voxel. It depends on the local density and the chemical element(s) present in the voxel, together with the incident photon energy. The set of parallel 2D slices allows rendering the object in 3D.

Maximum sample size depends on detector size and X-ray source. It varies, together with the maximum sample mass and sample height, with the type or brand of micro-CT scanners. For example, up to  $120\mathrm{mm}$  width,  $200\mathrm{mm}$  height and  $1.5\mathrm{kg}$  mass, samples can be positioned with the Phoenix Nanotom S<sup>®</sup> micro-CT scanner (Zacher et al. 2010). But this is provided that the material is not too dense. The voxel size of micro-CT scans is about  $1/1000^{\mathrm{th}}$  of the sample width at maximum magnification. For extreme sample magnification (i.e., samples of millimetre and submillimetre size), the spatial resolution reaches the submicrometre level. It is governed by the size of the electron beam that hits the anode target within the X-ray tube used as source of X-rays.

Imaging errors such as beam hardening, partial volume, ring, metal streak, conical beam, motion and phase contrast artefacts (not to be confused with archaeological artefacts) are inherent to X-ray micro-CT. Beam hardening is caused by the differential attenuation of polychromatic X-rays through materials of variable density and thickness. Among others, it makes the edge of the scanned object to appear artificially more attenuating (Ketcham & Carlson 2001). Partial volume is related to the presence in a same voxel of materials with different attenuation coefficients. The materials of subvoxel size cannot be distinguished on the scan. Nevertheless the grey value of the voxel to which they belong is an average of their properties (Ketcham & Carlson 2001).

Ring artefact can result from differences in pixel sensitivity in the X-ray detector. It can also be associated with metal streak artefacts (Ketcham & Carlson 2001). Metal streak is generated when a relatively highly attenuating inclusion is aligned parallel to the X-ray beam during sample rotation. It manifests itself as a very bright star with a false void next to it. In the worst cases, false low density rings appear on the 2D slice containing the bright inclusion as well as on the adjacent slices (Ketcham & Carlson 2001; Tarplee et al. 2011). Conical beam artefacts affect 2D slices that are far from the centre of the X-ray beam. Motion artefacts are due to sample movement during scanning. They produce a blurred scan. A phase-contrast effect is caused by X-ray refraction at the boundary between materials with different attenuation coefficients. It enhances edges between these materials. It is strong in objects with a low attenuation coefficient that are scanned at a high resolution (Wilkins et al. 1996). Most micro-CT artefacts cannot be fully mitigated in complex heterogeneous samples (Ketcham & Carlson 2001; Tarplee et al. 2011; Cnudde & Boon 2013) and one has to be aware of these 'artefacts' to avoid misinterpreting the scans.

X-ray micro-CT can also be conducted at one of the few synchrotron facilities available worldwide. Synchotron-based micro-CT scanning is performed with the help of a high quality parallel monochromatic beam. Compared to lab-based micro-CT, synchrotron based micro-CT is faster and provides results with similar or often higher degree of detail. Moreover, it eliminates the beam hardening and conical beam X-ray artefacts mentioned above. Certain X-ray beam lines, in addition to attenuation contrast-based tomography, also allow phase-contrast-based tomography, which is particularly useful for imaging the structure of low-density materials such as organic objects and peat (Bertrand et al. 2012). However, synchrotrons are not as accessible as lab-based micro-CT scanners to the archaeological community. For large archaeological samples, medical or industrial CT scanner can be used at the expense of spatial resolution.

Micro-CT scanning equipment can also now be bought as an add-on to electron microscopes. Recently, micro-CT scanners that yield major element compositional data per voxel, have come onto the market (e.g., the Skyscan® 2140 micro-CT/micro-XRF). For both applications however, maximum sample sizes are much smaller than those for the standard stand-alone machines (e.g., less than  $10\mathrm{mm}$  for the Skyscan® SEM-mounted micro-CT and less than  $13\mathrm{mm}$  for the Skyscan® 2140 micro-CT/micro-XRF). Moreover scanning time is increased. Field versions of transportable micro-CT systems (Tuniz et al. 2013) are also in development.

# 42.2 Sampling and Analytical Procedures

# 42.2.1 Sample Types

Micro-CT scanning can be applied to various types of samples:

- directly onto undisturbed, untreated soil samples;  
- prior to impregnating, on soil samples in Kubiena tins or other types of sample boxes;  
- on impregnated soil blocks or slabs, before or after preparation of a thin section for micromorphological analysis.

For example, Figure 42.1 shows the results from a micro-CT scan employed to check the integrity of a vibrocore-derived sandy sample in an aluminium Kubiëna tin, prior to thin section preparation. Void distribution and sedimentary layering can be discerned clearly. It shows that a micro-CT scan can be used to select samples for thin sectioning and determine the position and the orientation for the plane of thin sectioning that will facilitate the micromorphological interpretation. While the production of thin sections is labour intensive and takes at least several months, a micro-CT scan of good quality can be recorded, processed and analysed in a simple way, within three hours. Multiple samples can also be scanned to check for representativeness.

# 42.2.2 Sample-Related Limitations

# 42.2.2.1 Organic Matter, Water and Resin

The X-ray attenuation contrast between pore fluids and organic matter is low (Quinton et al. 2009). Therefore organic tissues forming peats can only be discerned on micro-CT scans (Figure 42.2) when the samples have lost their free water as well as part of their capillary and bounded water. This, unfortunately, causes irreversible shrinkage and deformation to the fabric of the peat. It is possible, however, to visualize some peat tissues on micro-CT scans by doping the pore fluid, or by staining peat fibres with contrast agents (Kettridge & Binley 2011; van Loo et al. 2014).

Scanning impregnated blocks also has the disadvantage that organic matter has a similar X-ray attenuation coefficient as resin and therefore becomes almost indistinguishable from the resin itself. Carrying out phase contrast-based, instead of attenuation contrast-based micro-CT, in a synchrotron might, however, be more useful for distinguishing organic matter from resin.

# 42.2.2.2 Subsampling

Maximum possible resolution of the scans increases with decreasing sample (or object) size. In order to increase resolution it is sometimes necessary to subsample.

The subsample can be a few millimetres wide provided it is larger than the representative elementary volume of the archaeological material. Impregnated blocks can be subsampled by sawing with a diamond-coated saw but the use of a hollow drill has the added advantage that cylindrical samples are produced, therefore limiting potential reconstruction imperfections and streak artefacts (Tarplee et al. 2011). It should be noted that dry core drilling may be necessary when water soluble material - e.g. PEG - has been used to impregnate the sample.

Processed micro-CT scans form in essence a 3D model of the linear attenuation coefficient of the material in the sample. Dedicated software such as Fiji (Schlindelin et al. 2012), Morpho  $^+$  (Brabant et al. 2011) and AVIZO is subsequently used to visualize and analyse this model, allowing for multiple cross-sections with arbitrary orientations to be displayed simultaneously. The interior of a 3D data set can be viewed in real time (from any position) using an intuitive technique called volume rendering. This technique simulates light transmission through the object from the viewing point, making the voxels more-or-less semitransparent, so that they do not obstruct the view of the voxels placed behind them. Subsequently, images can be segmented into diverse components to allow a quantitative analysis of each component. Materials or features that are distinct because of their attenuation – like organic material, sand grains, bone fragments, shells and pores – can be identified, separated using segmentation tools and counted before being visualized (see Figures 42.3 and 42.4) and subjected to digital size, shape, and orientation analysis. Segmentation requires image thresholding, in other words, image conversion based on grey levels into binary images in order to select the phase (voids, groundmass, coarse fraction, inclusions, artefacts etc.) of interest. It separates discrete zones or object with the same phase into individual objects that touch each other in reality or appear visually to be connected on the scan because of lack of density or spatial resolution of the scan. At each step of the processing, including image noise reduction, the operator can choose between several (semi)automatic techniques, each technique requiring the setting of a few parameters (Brabant et al. 2011).

The results of the separation analysis should be inspected carefully as segmentation based on semiautomatic grey level thresholding and the application of denoising in images can be subjective and separation of adjacent items having a complex geometry can fail (Cnudde & Boon 2013; Maire & Whitters 2014).

Micro-CT scanning of soil samples or impregnated blocks in combination with micromorphology gives a

much-desired third dimension to microarchaeology (see Weiner 2010). If scans and slides come from the same sample, the three-dimensional shape and articulations of an object's aggregates, domains or pores/cavities can be studied (see Figure 42.2). In many cases, the addition of 3D spatial information helps in understanding structures and objects that are visible in thin section, whereas micromorphological studies help to identify materials and features distinguished in micro-CT scans.

# 42.3 Archaeological Applications

The combination of micro-CT scanning and micromorphology for archaeological research is rather new and only a few examples have as yet been published. At an early stage in the development of high-resolution X-ray micro-CT, Adderley et al. (2001) investigated the correspondence between 2D image analysis of conventional thin sections with, 2D and 3D image analyses of micro-CT scans, for samples from midden deposits. They also illustrated the possibility of conducting a 3D spatial analysis of soil constituents (pores, minerals and organic matter) for a more robust interpretation of archaeological deposits.

Huisman et al. (2014) demonstrated the usefulness of the technique for studying midden material that is rich in small bones or bone fragments. Thin sections can reveal the presence of such bones; however, species identification and spatial distribution of bones are hard to derive from a thin section, which is essentially a random cut through the groundmass. Alternatively, sieving such a sample would allow identification but, conversely, destroys microstratigraphic information. Micro-CT scanning of soil samples, however, in combination with surface rendering of high density material, makes it possible to identify small bones to family or species level (Figure 42.4) - even though secondary iron oxides were also included in the high-density material. It reveals context information, making it possible to discern for example food preparation refuse (dominated by fish scales) from tossed or discarded meal residues (dominated by larger fish bones). In the same context, dietary information can be gleaned by targeting bone-rich faecal material, identified in thin section, and recognizing the bones embedded within it. To reach the resolution needed for this, however, it may be necessary to scan a subsample cut from an impregnated block (see Figure 42.5).

Ngan-Tillard et al. (2014, 2016) demonstrated the applicability of a combined micromorphology and micro-CT approach for archaeological heritage management. They studied structural damage in archaeological remains subjected to mechanical stress, such as that

which occurs underneath buildings or embankments. By comparing scans and thin sections from samples taken prior to and after loading (or outside and inside the area of loading), the approach can show changes in the soil structure and damage to objects such as charcoal and organic tissue. McBride & Mercer (2012) and Ngan-Tillard et al. (2014) found that fragile archaeological remains (like organic matter, charcoal and shells) embedded in sediment, remained undamaged under one dimensional stress, equivalent to a loading of several meters of soil. Ngan-Tillard et al. (2016) also observed some realignment and compression of noncharred organic tissue in micro-CT scans but found no damage at the cellular scale in the thin sections made after experimentally compressing the sample.

Since the start of the twenty-first century, the use of laboratory-based microtomography in geotechnology has already allowed many breakthroughs in our understanding of the mechanical as well as coupled processes taking place in soils (Viggiani et al. 2015).

archaeological sites, using such a combined approach. In the future, the accessibility of micro-CT and its application in archaeological soil micromorphology are expected to increase. Specific areas in which the application of micro-CT has great potential include:

- identification of animal and plant species based on seeds, small fish bones, shells, and so forth, embedded in sediments (see Huisman et al. 2014);  
- quantification of taphonomic and soil forming processes like bioturbation through the combined analysis of thin sections and micro-CT scans (see Taina et al. 2010 for applications in soil science);  
- characterization of the 3D size, shape and distribution of voids, aggregates and so forth, to analyse buried soils and surfaces (Adderley et al. 2001) in order to study landscape, land use and human activities;  
- identifying and quantifying degradation of archaeological sites due to plant roots, soil fauna and so forth.

Micro-CT allows visualization and analysis of distribution patterns of specific materials in archaeological sites, but only for rather strongly contrasting materials (or after enhancing contrast with doping agents) with little information on the exact nature of these materials. Thin section analysis is a much more powerful method, with full identification possibilities and higher resolution, but has the limitation that it is only two dimensional. An approach in which both techniques are combined plays to the strengths of both techniques.

Future improvements of the micro-CT technique, like increased compositional information per voxel, phase contrast-based micro-CT (in synchrotrons) and portable equipment, are expected to extend the possibilities even further. Moreover, the considerable progress that is foreseen in the (semi)automatic fusion of 2D or 3D data sets of various sources – including from thin sections – with micro-CT scans (Otani & Obara 2003; Desrues et al. 2006; Alshibli et al. 2010; Cnudde & Bernard 2013) can only support further development.

# Electron Probe X-ray Microanalysis (SEM-EPMA) Techniques

# 43.1 Principles of the Techniques

Scanning electron microscope-mounted electron probe X-ray microanalysis (SEM-EPMA) methods take advantage of the fact that the high-energy electron beam may displace an electron from an inner orbit of the atoms of the material being studied. When this happens, an electron from a higher energy outer orbit may replace the displaced one, leading to the release of an X-ray whose energy and wavelength is characteristic of the element to which the atom belongs (Brundle et al. 1992). SEM-EPMA includes two different techniques: energy dispersive (SEM-EDX) and wavelength dispersive (SEM-WDX) X-ray spectroscopy.

SEM-EDX (also referred to as SEM-EDS, EDAX, EDXMA, EDXA or XEDS) uses a detector that converts the energy of each X-ray collected to a voltage of proportional size. In this way, it simultaneously constructs a complete energy spectrum of all the X-rays produced from all the elements in the material being analysed. By contrast, SEM-WDX (also referred to as SEM-WDS or microprobe) uses diffracting crystal spectrometers optimized for the elements of interest. The two techniques have relative advantages and drawbacks as outlined in Table 43.1, but generally SEM-WDX offers better detection limits and higher precision and accuracy, whilst SEM-EDX is quicker, cheaper and more widely available (Leng 2013), and for many applications is more than adequate.

A large number of other microanalytical SEM mounted techniques may be applied to thin sections including PIXIE, XRF, Raman, and IR (Mentzer & Quade 2013). However, these are less widely available and often require specialized sample preparation (e.g., self-supporting sections, plastic mounts, or thick sections) in contrast to the minimal preparation required for SEM-EDX and SEM-WDX analysis.

# 43.2 Sample Preparation and Analysis

# 43.2.1 Sample Preparation

Thin sections are ideal for SEM-EPMA as their polished surfaces eliminate shadow effects (Leng 2013). For both SEM-EDX and -WDX analyses, the thin sections must not be cover slipped, while careful cleaning of the slide is recommended to avoid contamination from the lapping fluids or lapping plate (Figure 43.1). The size of a typical thin section is also a consideration, as, depending on the chamber size and stage travel of the SEM used, they may need to be cut to size to fit within the SEM (Mentzer & Quade 2013).

The application of a conductive coating may be required to prevent the buildup of excessive static charge. For microanalysis, carbon is generally used in preference to gold as it interferes less with the electron beam and the X-rays produced (Limandri et al. 2010). However, carbon cannot be used if it is itself of interest (Wilson et al. 2013a). Coating can be avoided altogether if the SEM is configured to operate at lower vacuum conditions as the introduction of air into the SEM chamber protects the specimen from charging. It is also advisable to carry out resin stability tests as higher electron beam energies can cause damage (Figure 43.2) to the sample surface.

Another consideration is the ability to locate the features of interest in the SEM, particularly if whole thin sections are being used. Images at multiple scales of the features of interest and whole slide scans of the section may be beneficial. Some modern SEM systems offer image navigation whereby features can be located from a scan of the thin section that includes three known points; metal tape, etchings or the corners of the thin section may aid in this process.

# 43.2.2 Sampling Considerations

SEM-EDX and -WDX analyses take two forms: point analysis and mapping (whereby the electron beam scans over the material surface). Point analyses can provide quantitative chemical data from individual points, grids or transects of points (Figure 43.3). Mapping provides semiquantitative data on element distributions across fields of view that are typically less than  $4\mathrm{mm}^2$  (Figures 43.4 and 43.5). As well as scanning across two-dimensional areas of the slide, it is also possible

to produce a line scan demonstrating changes in the relative concentrations of elements along a transect (Figure 43.6). The sampling strategy needs to be chosen carefully depending on the questions being asked and the nature of the material being analysed.

It is important to be aware of the volume of material that is being analysed (the interaction volume), which depends on the composition of the material and the SEM operating conditions. Typical interaction volumes are in the order of  $2\mu \mathrm{m}$  in diameter and depth (Walker 2014).

# 43.2.3 Data Considerations

Element mapping is not normally quantitative because each image pixel contains too few X-ray counts to enable quantification and the assessment of concentrations as both weight percentage and atomic percentage for each element. If optimization standards are used to account

for beam drift, then point analysis on thin sections can be fully quantitative, particularly if sample-relevant external standards are also used to account for matrix effects and assess data accuracy (Williamson et al. 2004). Data acquired without the use of standards is typically normalized to  $100\%$ , but can be misleading as it excludes trace elements and will be influenced by the introduction of carbon and oxygen from the resin (Smith 2010; Falsone et al. 2014). However, even normalized data can be useful as long as element ratios are used in any comparisons rather than absolute values (Wilson et al. 2013b).

# 43.3 Archaeological Applications

Whilst still not routine, the complementarity of SEM-EPMA techniques to traditional micromorphological analysis has been long recognized (Bisdom et al. 1981; Jongmans et al. 1999). As opposed to bulk chemical analysis, SEM-EPMA analysis of soil thin sections allows specific soil components to be targeted and enables the chemistry of these materials to be considered within their undisturbed soil or sedimentary contexts. Thus, its value in archaeological studies has been widely

acknowledged (Weiner 2010). Archaeological applications typically fall into three categories:

- the identification or confirmation of specific minerals or archaeological materials in thin section;  
- chemical characterization of the soil fine mass often with the aim of determining its source(s);  
- analysis of the taphonomic alteration of archaeological materials.

# 43.3.1 Identification of Archaeological Materials, Ecofacts and Minerals

The identification (or confirmation) of specific archaeological materials and minerals represents the main application of SEM-EPMA techniques to archaeological soil thin sections. Both point analysis and element mapping have been used to identify soil minerals (e.g., Tsatskin & Nadel 2003; Correa et al. 2013) and in phosphate rich archaeological contexts the analysis of secondary neoformed minerals such as vivianite, metalliferous spherulites and Ca Fe phosphates (Figure 43.5) has been particularly beneficial (Leguédois et al. 2004; Correa et al. 2013; Macphail et al. 2013). Not only have SEM-EPMA techniques been able to confirm the micromorphological interpretation of these features but the chemical data obtained has added to our understanding of the conditions of their formation, whether as vivianite in dark earths subject to groundwater saturation (Nicosia 2009), calcium phosphates forming crusts in the acidic, anaerobic conditions of stabling deposits (Macphail et al. 2004), as cemented iron calcium phosphate bands in ash rich Bronze Age pit fills subjected to wetting and drying (Nicosia 2009) or as coatings in dark earths with impeded drainage (Nicosia et al. 2012).

The microchemical study of a wide range of archaeological materials and ecofacts in soil thin sections has previously included SEM/EDX analysis of coprolites (Nicosia et al. 2012; Nicosia & Devos 2014 - Figure 43.7), faecal spherulites (Canti 1997), bone (Figure 43.4), pottery and pottery glazes (Lang, 2014) and charcoal (Davidson et al. 2007a). SEM-EDX can highlight the presence of Ca and P in suspected carnivore-omnivore coprolite fragments, as these are normally highly phosphatic (Bronniman et al. 2017, this book) and/or characterized by a hydroxyapatite cement (Macphail & Goldberg 2010), enabling a more robust identification (Figure 43.8).

SEM-EDX analyses have also been used to distinguish anthropogenic microcharcoal from opaque mafic minerals such as ilmenite (Davidson et al. 2007b), coal (Wilson et al. 2008) and humified organic matter (Davidson et al. 2007a) based on O:C ratios and trace-element concentrations.

# 43.3.2 Soil Chemical Characterization / Sourcing

Integrating bulk chemical analyses with microstratigraphic soil micromorphology has long been a problem for studies of archaeology (Shillito et al. 2009; Weiner 2010; Mentzer & Quade 2013). Even when coarser sedimentary units are examined (e.g., Devos et al. 2013; Kuhn et al. 2010) the difference in the scale of observation between the disturbed bulk samples and the strata and microartefacts observed micromorphologically can limit interpretation. SEM-EPMA techniques allow for greater spatial control in such analyses and the benefits for microstratigraphic analysis are clear, for example in the study of floor layers (Macphail et al. 2004) and to characterize specific microfabrics (Macphail et al. 1998; Maghsoudi et al. 2014) to aid in the interpretation of parent materials and site formation processes. Whilst the advantages of microanalysis are clear, the wider representativeness of the data must be borne in mind if it is to be used to identify wider land management practices such as identifying chemical signatures of manuring and land management practices in Norse Greenland, highlighting differences in nutrient loadings (P, K, Ca and Mg) between fields (Golding et al. 2015), or to characterize chemically and trace the movement of midden material in prehistoric field systems in Orkney, UK (Hamlet 2014).

# 43.3.3 Taphonomic Alteration of Archaeological Materials

SEM-EPMA analysis of soil thin sections is particularly suited for taphonomic studies of artefacts and organic matter (Falsone et al. 2014; Wilson et al. 2013a) as they are retained in an undisturbed state within the soil environment. Thus, interactions between the soil and the

artefact edges can be studied in much greater detail and it is possible to understand taphonomic processes within the context of soil structure, void space (Smith 2010; Falsone et al. 2014) and stratigraphy (Correa et al. 2013).

Studies on bone, for example, have examined both its decomposition (Estevez et al. 2014) and its postdepositional uptake of metals (Davidson et al. 2007a; Wilson et al. 2008), whereas Van Hoesen & Arriaza (2011) have

used SEM-EDX in combination with micromorphology to show the origin of sediments used to encase Chinchorro mummies in Chile and to understand the role of these gypsum and clay rich sediments in the

mummification process. SEM-EPMA analysis of bone in soil thin section may also enable study of the migration of elements such as P, Ca and Fe away from the degrading body through the soil (Usai et al. 2014).

# 44.1 Principles of the Analytical Method

Reflected light microscopy is used mainly in the petrographic analysis of thin sections in archaeological contexts to identify and classify the organic components. It is appropriate for determining the metallic minerals (pyrite, marcasite, hematite, goethite, manganese oxides, etc.), which are generally opaque in thin section (Picot & Johan 1982).

The methodology used to study the organic components is that of organic petrology, which was developed principally from the years 1963 to 1995 for the petrographic study of peat, brown coal, hard coals, source rocks and other rocks containing organic carbon (Diessel 1992; Taylor et al. 1998; Suárez-Ruiz et al. 2012a). The organic components, named macerals, are defined on the basis of their morphography (morphology, internal appearance), their physical properties (colour and reflectance, anisotropy, fluorescence, polishing hardness) and their chemical properties. The microscopy techniques of organic petrology therefore involve the combined use of reflectance and incident fluorescence microscopy.

Several maceral classifications exist but the most used and accepted is that of the International Committee for Coal and Organic Petrology (ICCP), which was originally developed for brown coals and hard coal (ICCP 1963, 1971, 1975) and then completed for organic-matter-rich sediments other than coal, including oil shales and petroleum-source rocks (ICCP 1993; Taylor et al. 1998). Three groups of macerals may be distinguished: the vitrinite group, which comprises macerals derived from plant tissues composed of lignin and cellulose (ICCP 1998); the liptinite group, which embraces macerals derived from hydrogen-rich plant remains such as pollen, spores, algae, cuticles, resins, waxes; and the inertinite group whose macerals are derived from the same precursors as

vitrinite and liptinite but have been subject to dehydration and oxidation by alteration, or by charring induced by wild fires (ICCP 2001). It is important to note that the optical properties of macerals change during coalification. This is clearly visible by comparing the plant tissues in soft brown coals (low coalified), which appear dark grey in reflected light and show dark brown fluorescence, with those in bituminous coals (more coalified), which are medium grey in reflected light and mostly nonfluorescent (Teichmüller 1989). The ICCP therefore established two distinct maceral classifications for the coalification products of humic substances (originated from lignocellulosic plant tissues) in brown coals (termed also lignites) and in hard coals: the classification of huminite (Sýkorová et al. 2005) and the classification of vitrinite (ICCP 1998). The classification of huminite is generally the most appropriate for petrographic analysis of humic substances in peat (Grady et al. 1993; Calder 1993), in soils (Jacob 1972, 1973) and, by extension, in archaeological soils and sediments (Stahlschmidt et al. 2015a). Other organic components, such as, for example, natural char, whose formation could be related to ground fire or surface fire and which occurs in coals and sediments, were not included by ICCP in the three maceral groups (Kwiecińska & Petersen 2004).

# 44.2 Sampling and Analytical Procedure

# 44.2.1 Sample Preparation for Organic Petrology Study in Archaeological Contexts

Although the organic petrological investigations are usually carried out on polished particulate mounts or on polished blocks (Ligouis 2006; Goldberg et al. 2009), thin sections employed by micromorphologists can also be

used to investigate organic components in reflected light. However, some rules must be followed to ensure the quality of petrographic analyses.

The block samples must be very well impregnated (if possible under vacuum) with nonfluorescing or low-fluorescing resin (for example epoxy resins) before the preparation of the thin sections. Thin sections must not have a thickness of less than  $30\mu \mathrm{m}$ . Thicker thin sections have advantages because they increase the cohesion and stability of the organic particles (especially charcoal and all tissues in general) and thus the accuracy of analysis. Thin sections can be prepared following the standard methods. However, the fine grind must be extended to a 2500 grit size SiC  $(8\mu \mathrm{m})$ , followed by a diamond  $(3\mu \mathrm{m})$  rough-polish step on a polishing cloth and an alumina  $(0.05\mu \mathrm{m})$  fine-polish step on a soft very low nap synthetic polishing cloth, in order to obtain an uniformly flat thin section with relief- and scratch-free organic particles (see also standard coal sample preparation procedures in Taylor et al. 1998). Rough polishing and fine polishing steps are performed with decreasing low pressures using wet polishing cloths. A lap speed of 150 to  $100\mathrm{rpm}$  is generally suitable. In the case of poorly impregnated or soft and fragile samples, the use of dry polishing methods is much more appropriate but more laborious. Thin sections cannot be covered because organic petrography analyses are carried out using oil immersion objectives.

# 44.2.2 Equipment and Analytical Procedures

To carry out the petrographic analyses, a reflected light microscope photometer equipped for fluorescence examination with the capability of switching to white light illumination and setup with oil immersion objectives  $20\mathrm{x}$  and  $50\mathrm{x}$  is used. The immersion oil used has a refractive index of  $\mathrm{ne}(546\mathrm{nm}) = 1.518$  (at  $23^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ). The identification of organic components and the assessment of their optical properties are carried out in combined incident white light (reflectance) and UV light illumination (example of equipment: excitation filter  $355-425\mathrm{nm}$ , beam-splitting mirror RKP  $455\mathrm{nm}$ , barrier filter LP470 nm).

There are two types of methods: qualitative and quantitative. The qualitative method is descriptive and delivers, for example, a result expressed as 'present', 'absent' or 'abundant' (Stahlschmidt et al. 2015a). Based on morphological and optical properties (see above), the method enables to identify organic components or macerals of different origin. For example, the presence or absence of burnt tissues (fusinite) or of nongelified tissues (textinite) will provide information on the origin of the tissues as well as the processes that could have affected the mineral matrix in which they are cemented. Nevertheless,

Figure 44.1 The map shows the deep interior chamber of the Hohtle Fels Cave (Swabian Jura, Germany) and the location of the samples HF 10 and HF 14 whose organic petrology results are shown in Figures 44.2, 44.3, 44.4, 44.5. The cave contains a stratified sequence of occupation spanning the Middle Palaeolithic to the Magdalenian (Goldberg et al. 2003). The Gravettian-aged 'burnt-bone horizon' 3cf has been interpreted as the result of anthropogenic 'dumping' of combusted material (Schiegl et al. 2003).

qualitative analysis will permit the detection of organic components, to determine their origin, to assess their preservation grade, and to use them in the reconstruction of the depositional conditions of the sediment (Figures 44.1 and 44.2; Table 44.1).

Two quantitative methods can be used in the case of archaeological applications: maceral analysis and reflectance analysis.

Maceral analysis is the quantitative estimation of the proportions of macerals in any sediment (Taylor et al. 1998; Schneider & Göthel 2001). This can be performed on either a mineral-free basis or mineral-containing basis. It is carried out using incident white and blue light illumination, in combination. The microscope should be set up with an oil immersion objective  $50\mathrm{x}$  and oculars  $10\mathrm{x}$ , one containing a cross hair. An automatic point counter is fitted to the microscope stage and connected to a PC. The analysed lines run perpendicular to the bedding. It is recommended to count 1000 points. The spacing of the points or step length is chosen in order to ensure the coverage of the surface of the thin section. The step length along each line must be identical to the spacing between the lines. When the grid point coincides with a maceral, this is determined and recorded. Maceral analysis results are expressed in

Figure 44.2 Organic petrology analysis on polished thin sections. Scanned images of the thin sections showing the spatial distribution of charcoal (fusinite, inertodetrinite) and of other organic constituents (sporinite, funginite, huminite), of combustion residues from bones (partially burnt bones, bone char, fat-derived char), of permineralized root tissues, of phytoliths and of anthropogenic lithocomponents (microclasts of Lower Jurassic bituminous shale). The inertodetrinite-rich microlayer recorded in thin section HF 10-2 (b) can be interpreted as an undisturbed hearth basis, which is supported by the presence of fusinite. However, fusinite tissues can disappear completely by permineralization (c). The origin of the root tissues observed in thin sections HF 10-2, HF 14-2, HF 14-3 ((b), (c) and (e) respectively) is not clear because of their permineralization. The presence of fungal remains in thin sections HF 14-2 and HF 14-3 ((c) and (e) respectively) indicates that fungal degradation took place in the sediment and that a part of the original organic matter has been degraded. The identification of microclasts of Lower Jurassic bituminous shale of anthropogenic origin in all thin sections was made possible through the use of fluorescence. These microclasts are wastes produced by the extraction of jet from oil shales, which were introduced in the cave. Jet artefacts have been effectively recorded in several caves in the Swabian Mountains, including Hohe Fels Cave (Conard & Uerpmann 1999).

Table 44.1 The results of organic petrological analyses may be ideally summarized in data tables. Table 44.1 integrates the results of the qualitative petrographic analysis complemented by observations (particle frequency, particle size, fluorescence colour and intensity of liptinite macerals, state of preservation of organic particles, heat-affected particle or not, mineralization, etc.), the results of the reflectance analysis of charcoal (fusinite) and of the different types of fat-derived char based on their colour (dark grey, middle grey, light grey) and heterogeneity or homogeneity. This representation has the advantage of allowing easy comparison of samples. Thus, we note that fusinite is much more frequent in the sampling locality HF 10 and especially in the sample HF 10-2, which contains the burnt bone layer. The fusinite is characterized by a relatively low reflectance of about  $0.95\% \mathrm{R}$  (low reflecting fusinite), which has been recorded in both sampling localities. It is assumed that this fusinite was formed at temperatures lower than  $400^{\circ}C$  (see our unpublished data from fire experiments; Jones et al. 1993; Bustin and Guo 1999). Parameters such as preservation state and size of charcoal tissues and fat-derived char particles can be taken into account to determine if a sequence represents in situ burning or if the combustions residues have been reworked or trampled. The mixing of unburnt and burnt organic components may also suggest their redeposition. In addition, the results indicate that the samples are poor in fusinite and rich in fat-derived char of the categories middle grey and light grey. The size of the fat-derived char particles is very heterogeneous and the particles show a great variety of char textures (low-porosity char, char with large vesicles, homogeneous char, heterogeneous char, fissured char). Phosphatization processes have affected numerous tissues (Figures 44.4c and 44.5g), as well as fat-derived char particles. It can be concluded that bones were the principal fuel and that the burnt bone layer probably is not an in situ burning event.

volume percentage (percentage of the total of points counted). Triangular diagrams can be used for example to visualize the relative proportions of the three maceral groups huminite (H), liptinite (L), inertinite (I) or to depict the variability in petrographic composition (the corner points H, L, I represent samples consisting of pure huminite, liptinite or inertinite respectively) or for the classification of microfacies types.

Reflectance analysis is an important tool in organic petrology and is employed to determine the rank of coal and the maturation level of the sedimentary organic matter (Jacob 1980; Taylor et al. 1998; Volkmann 2003; Pross et al. 2007). Reflectance is measured on a single maceral of the vitrinite maceral group in coals and on individual vitrinite particles in sediments. In the study of archaeological soils, reflectance analysis is a useful tool, on the one hand to distinguish between huminite and low reflecting charcoal particles and on the other hand to characterize the charcoal particles (Figure 44.3; Table 44.1). Reflectance measurements on huminite and charcoal particles are conducted as described in Taylor et al. (1998) for the determination of vitrinite reflectance. A  $50\mathrm{x}$  oil immersion objective is used and a small measuring area (about  $2\mu \mathrm{m}$  in diameter) is exposed to the standard monochromatic light  $(\lambda = 546\mathrm{nm})$ . The random reflectance (Rr) is measured in nonpolarized light. The photometric system is calibrated using standard materials of known reflectance. The whole surface of the thin section is scanned and Rr readings are recorded for each huminite and/or charcoal particle depending on the aim of the study. However, particles smaller than  $5\mu \mathrm{m}$  in diameter and those showing strong polishing relief, scratches or impurities are ignored. Only one reading is taken for each particle. For each thin section, the results are given as mean random reflectance. The form of the reflectance histogram, the standard deviation and the number of readings therefore refer to the distribution of the reflectance in the whole thin section and to the abundance of the measured organic constituents (Figure 44.3, Table 44.1). Details of the instrumentation and the analysis procedure of reflectance measurements are described in the International Handbook of Coal Petrography (ICCP 1971), in Taylor et al. (1998) and in Borrego et al. (2006).

# 44.3 Archaeological Applications

Methods of organic petrology can be used for a wide range of archaeological applications. Organic petrology has proved especially useful for the study of sediments containing artefacts in order to confirm or infer the existence of occupational surfaces including hearths (Stahlschmidt et al. 2015b). In this work, macerals and organic microfacies based on maceral composition have been used as pal

aeo-environmental indicators for the reconstruction of the depositional environment of a fresh-water swamp, which was supposed to be the location of hunting.

Similarly, the determination of organic microfacies of archaeological sediments and soils using organic petrography in most cases allows the original organic matter (for example, the association of charcoal and natural char from wildfire occurring together with huminitic plant remains and funginite) to be distinguished from the anthropogenic organic components (charcoal associated with fat-derived char, bone char and partially charred bones – Figures 44.4 and 44.5), and therefore provides information on anthropogenic activities (Goldberg et al. 2009; Villagran et al. 2013; Clark & Ligouis 2010). However, it is important to take into account the alteration and degradation processes (oxidation, bacterial and fungal degradation) which could be responsible for the poor state of preservation of the organic matter or its disappearance.

Furthermore, in recent years, organic petrology has proven to be an important tool for the characterization of hearths (Figures 44.2, 44.3, 44.4 and 44.5). Organic petrological analysis of hearths allows, on the one hand, the identification and classification of combustion residues (Ligouis 2006) and consequently the determination of the fuel used. On the other hand, it provides information on combustion conditions (combustion temperature, air humidity, fuel dryness, oxygen supply, etc.).

Reflectance analysis can therefore be used to classify precisely the plant remains encountered in archaeological contexts, either in the huminite group (huminitic plant remains, unburnt; Sykorova et al. 2005) or in the inertinite group (charcoal - burnt plant remains) (Stahlschmidt et al. 2015a). This method can also be used, for example, to determine if bedding has been burnt. Schiegl et al. (2004) used reflectance analysis to characterize all burnt plant remains encountered in hearths at Sibudu (South Africa) and to compare the hearth units. The following organic components were identified and characterized in terms of reflectance: fusinite tissues, gels from cell fillings (secretinite; ICCP 2001), natural char (Kwiecińska & Petersen 2004) and fat-derived char (Goldberg et al. 2009).

Microphotometry in incident light (e.g., measurement of microreflectance or reflectance) also offers the possibility of estimating the temperature of formation of charcoal calculated from its reflectance value (Jones et al. 1991, 1993; Guo & Bustin 1998; Bustin & Guo 1999, Jones & Lim 2000).

Another field of application of organic petrology is the identification of the nature and the provenance of organic-rich sediments (sapropelic coals, oil shales, sapropelites, bitumen-rich brown coals), which have been used in Celtic Europe to sculpt objects such as armlets, beads

Figure 44.3 The reflectance histograms of the middle grey and light grey fat-derived char from the samples of both sampling localities illustrate the broad distribution of the reflectance values within the burnt bone layer (0.89 to  $1.59\% \mathrm{R}$  at HF 14-2; 0.82 to  $1.56\% \mathrm{R}$  at HF 10-2). However, reflectance values range as well as mean values (1.27%R and  $1.21\% \mathrm{R}$ ) show a good correlation, which indicates similar characteristics of the fat-derived char at both sampling location and therefore probably similar conditions of combustion. Reflectance of fat-derived char is therefore a useful tool to compare hearths with each other.

Figure 44.5 (a) Light grey, fat-derived char particle. Note the homogeneous appearance, the irregular distribution of large vesicles, the irregular outline showing convex and concave shapes, the numerous fissures and the high reflectivity of the particle. Slightly burnt bone fragment (left). Polished thin section HF 14-2, incident white light, oil immersion. (b) Same field of view as (a) but in incident light fluorescent mode, oil immersion. Note the absence of fluorescence (black) of the fat-derived char particle and the dark fluorescence of the slightly burnt bone. (c) Thin coating of light grey, fat-derived char surrounding a mineral pellet with a quartz grain. Slightly burnt bone fragments and a light grey, fat-derived char particle can be easily identified in the upper left corner. Polished thin section HF 14-1, incident white light, oil immersion. (d) Phosphate-rich calcareous clayey groundmass containing bright yellow fluorescing sporinite (centre). Polished thin section HF 14-3, incident light fluorescent mode, oil immersion. (e) Funginite (sclerotia). Polished thin section HF 14-2, incident white light, oil immersion. (f) Phosphate-rich calcareous clayey groundmass containing a poorly preserved huminitic tissue (unburnt) and a middle grey, dense and fissured fat-derived char particle (right). Polished thin section HF 14-2, incident white light, oil immersion. (g) Phosphatized root tissue (cortex). Polished thin section HF 14-2, incident white light, oil immersion. (h) Microclast of Lower Jurassic bituminous shale of anthropogenic origin embedded in the phosphate-rich calcareous clayey groundmass. The microclast cut perpendicular to bedding shows numerous bright yellow fluorescing filamentous algae and pyrite framboids (small dark spheres). Polished thin section HF 14-1, incident light fluorescent mode, oil immersion.

Fluorescence microscopy is particularly useful in the determination of tar, birch tar, resin, waxes, amber, jet and natural asphalt (Jacob 1989; Ligouis 2006; Suárez et al. 2012b), although a chemical characterization is often also necessary to provide a precise classification of these materials.
